4,Updating the figure of Iraqi deaths,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,True,False,True,True,Ambivalent,"The question asks the president to (1) amend/update his previously cited death figure (30,000) in light of a new report claiming 655,000 deaths, and (2) assess whether the report is credible. In the answer, he clearly addresses credibility: he explicitly says he does not consider the report credible and cites General Casey and Iraqi officials, adding that the methodology was “pretty well discredited.” However, on the specific item being classified—**updating the figure of Iraqi deaths**—he does not provide any revised number, range, or concrete update, nor does he reaffirm the 30,000 figure explicitly. He shifts to general remarks (“a lot of innocent people have died”) and discussion of violence and Iraqi courage. Because the requested updated figure is not given, the response is incomplete with respect to the specific question."

Has he changed?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,Clear Reply,True,False,False,True,Clear Reply,"The specific question is “Has he changed?” The interviewer is asking whether Putin is different now compared to when the president previously said he looked into his soul and found him trustworthy. In the answer, the president says: “the person who I was referring to in 2001 is the same strong-willed person.” This directly addresses the change question by explicitly asserting continuity (i.e., no change in the person). He then elaborates on ongoing agreements/disagreements and the complexity of the relationship, but the core requested information—whether Putin has changed—is clearly stated."
11,Shape of the multinational force,Clear Reply,Clear Non-Reply,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,False,False,False,True,Ambivalent,"The specific question is asking for the *shape* of the multinational force (i.e., what form/structure it should take). In the answer, the speaker explicitly says the details of the troops/force will be discussed at a meeting Monday and that it requires international consensus, implying no concrete shape is being provided now. He does offer a general principle: the force should “serve as a complement to a Lebanese force” and its purpose is to strengthen the Lebanese government by helping the Lebanese army move into the area. However, he does not specify the force’s actual structure, composition, mandate, size, command arrangement, or operational design—i.e., the “shape” in any concrete sense. He even states he could answer better later and deflects (“read your newspaper”). Thus, the response provides only a broad, incomplete description rather than the requested specific information."

13,What have they achieved and what will they leave behind for their successors?,Clear Reply,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,True,False,False,True,Ambivalent,"The specific question asks for concrete achievements and what will be “bequeathed” to successors. In the answer, the speaker does identify achievements, but mostly at a high level: improved U.S.-Russia relations compared to the Cold War, no longer viewing each other as enemies, ability to achieve “positive results” in broad areas (counterterrorism, nonproliferation, missile technology, drugs), and economic cooperation. He also says these areas create a “reliable platform for cooperation” contributing to international security. However, he does not provide concrete, specific accomplishments (e.g., named agreements, programs, measurable outcomes) nor does he explicitly describe what specific items/policies/institutions will be left to successors beyond the general “platform” and improved relationship. Because the response addresses the topic but in generalized, non-specific terms and only implicitly answers the “leave behind” part, it is incomplete."
14,Are you willing to acknowledge that a change may be needed?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,Clear Reply,True,False,False,True,Clear Reply,"The question asks for an explicit acknowledgment: whether he is willing to concede that a change in strategy may be needed. In the answer, he does not say “yes” in that exact phrasing, but he repeatedly affirms the underlying point: “we're constantly changing tactics,” “America needs to adjust. I completely agree,” and he states he would support doing things differently, more troops, or “devise a new strategy” if General Casey recommends it. This directly communicates willingness to acknowledge that change/adjustment may be necessary, even if framed as tactical adjustments and conditional on military advice. The requested information (acknowledgment that change may be needed) is explicitly provided via “I completely agree” and the stated openness to a new strategy."

16,What is your philosophy on granting Presidential pardons?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,Clear Non-Reply,Ambivalent,True,False,True,True,Ambivalent,"The question asks for the President’s *philosophy* on granting pardons (and also whether he considers himself “stingy”). In the answer, he does not give a substantive philosophy (e.g., principles like mercy, rehabilitation, correcting injustices, etc.). Instead, he says he doesn’t have the criteria in front of him, asserts there is a “strict criterion” used by DOJ and White House Counsel, and notes he hasn’t compared his numbers to other presidents. He adds one limited guiding idea: a “scorecard” (number of pardons) should not be the guidepost. That is a partial, general statement and does not clearly articulate his overall philosophy or the criteria. So he provides some related content but not a direct, specific philosophy."
17,Would you campaign against Senator Joe Lieberman on Iraq?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,False,True,False,True,Clear Reply,"- The question asks for a specific commitment: whether the speaker would campaign against Senator Joe Lieberman on Iraq.  
- The answer is: “I’m going to stay out of Connecticut.” This is a clear statement of intended action/inaction regarding involvement in that race.  
- While it doesn’t explicitly say “I will not campaign against Lieberman,” staying out of Connecticut directly implies not campaigning there, which would include not campaigning against him on Iraq.  
- This is not a refusal (“can’t comment”), not ignorance, and not a vague generality; it provides a concrete position (non-involvement in Connecticut)."
18,Would you veto the bill if it passes in the form that the Armed Services Committee approved yesterday?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,True,False,True,True,Ambivalent,"The specific question asks for a concrete commitment: whether the President would veto the bill if it passed in the Armed Services Committee’s form. In the answer, he discusses ongoing negotiations, progress in the House, work needed in the Senate, and explains why Common Article 3 needs definition. He never states “yes,” “no,” or any conditional veto position, nor does he explicitly address the veto question at all. The response is a pivot to broader justification and process rather than the requested veto commitment."

28,Why do you still say there is a relationship between them?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,Clear Reply,True,False,False,True,Clear Reply,"The question asks for an explanation of *why he still says there is a relationship* between Saddam Hussein and Zarqawi/Al Qaeda, and whether he still believes it. In the answer, he does provide a rationale: he says his point was that Iraq was a state sponsor of terror and that Zarqawi was in Iraq (came for treatment), and he lists Saddam’s alleged terror-related behavior (harboring terrorists, paying families of suicide bombers). He also clarifies/qualifies the “relationship” claim by stating, “I never said there was an operational relationship,” reframing what he meant by “relationship” as presence/harboring rather than operational coordination. This is responsive: it explains why he continued to make the claim (because he viewed Saddam as a terror sponsor and Zarqawi was in Iraq) and clarifies the nature of the relationship he asserts. While it partially shifts from “relationship” to “state sponsor of terror,” it still gives concrete reasons tied to the relationship claim rather than refusing or being purely vague."

30, New Policy on Intercepting North Korean Ships,Clear Reply,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,True,False,False,True,Ambivalent,"The question asks for information about “reports that there’s a new policy on intercepting North Korean ships at sea” (and separately asks about concern over provoking North Korea). In the answer, the speaker does address the substance of the “intercepting ships” issue, but not in a concrete, confirmatory way. He reframes it as “not simply a U.S. policy” but an “international policy” under a UN Security Council resolution calling for “interdiction of arms shipments.” He then says implementation details (“how that's going to be implemented… cooperation…”) will be discussed in coming months, without stating what the “new policy” specifically is, whether the reports are accurate, what rules of engagement apply, or what operational changes are being made. Much of the remainder shifts to broader messaging about breaking a pattern of rewarding belligerence and enforcing sanctions. So he provides some relevant context (interdiction is part of UNSC sanctions) but does not clearly answer the specific “new policy” report with specific, concrete information."

In the provided answer, the President instead lists several “messages” aimed at “the American people” about NATO/transatlantic alliance strength, improved U.S.-Europe relations, and U.S. leadership, with an Afghanistan example. He explicitly says only at the end that he will “finally” get to the specific question, but the excerpt is truncated before any message to Kyl/Republicans or about START ratification is actually stated. Since the requested information (the message to those senators regarding START in the lame duck session) is not provided in the visible text, the response functions as a deflection/redirect rather than a direct answer."

In the answer, the President does not explicitly say “it does not change my mind” or “it changes my mind.” Instead, he (1) asserts his belief that Gates thinks removing Saddam was right, (2) says he hasn’t spoken to Gates about the column, and (3) emphasizes trust in Gates and that Gates believes they will succeed. This functions as a defense/deflection: it reframes the issue as Gates being aligned with him and avoids directly stating whether the President’s own view has changed. While one can infer the President’s mind is unchanged, it is not stated explicitly in the requested form."

The answer does not directly say “yes, we can get a deal” or “no, we can’t,” nor does it describe a specific deal being negotiated or its likelihood. Instead, the speaker reframes the question as being about “flexibility in the law,” explains that they are constrained by congressional legislation, notes the Senate’s intent to extend deadlines, and says the executive branch is proceeding as if nothing will change while trying to communicate to Canada what a “reasonable policy” is. He adds that if Congress is flexible, they will be flexible, and then discusses border documentation burdens. This provides context and conditional possibilities, but it does not explicitly answer the core “chance of getting a deal” question in a concrete way; any “chance” is only implied and contingent on Congress, without a clear assessment."

In the answer, the speaker mentions “maintain close cooperation and coordination with the United States, including the abduction issue,” and refers generally to using “all kinds of opportunities,” with the U.N. as “an opportunity to express our common concern.” However, the response does not specify concrete cooperative actions tailored to the abduction issue (e.g., joint negotiations, sanctions tied to abductees, intelligence sharing, diplomatic steps), and much of the remainder shifts to missile defense and broader alliance themes. Thus, the answer gestures at cooperation but stays vague and non-specific regarding the abduction issue itself."

The answer begins with “I would certainly hope so,” which is a weak, non-committal expression rather than an explicit “yes, I’m confident” or “no, I’m not.” The speaker then reframes “sustain the level of spending” as ensuring troops have what they need and shifts to urging Members of Congress to support troops in harm’s way. This provides a justification and a moral appeal but does not clearly state that the spending level can and will be sustained, nor does it address constraints, plans, or certainty. The requested information (clear confidence/ability to sustain spending) is only implied and hedged."
53,What is the magnet?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,False,True,False,True,Clear Reply,"The question asks for “the magnet/pressure point/hook” that would get Hizballah to accept a cease-fire—i.e., what leverage would work. The answer identifies a specific mechanism: “international pressure” applied to Hizballah and “its sponsors,” delivered through U.S. coordination with allies to send a message that sponsoring terror is unacceptable. This directly proposes the “magnet” as external diplomatic/political pressure on the group and its backers. While it’s not highly detailed about *how* that pressure would be applied, it does explicitly state what the leverage is."

Instead, he reframes the issue as “first things first”: Cuba must transition and the Cuban people must choose their government; only *after* that, “Cuban Americans can take an interest… and redress the issues of property confiscation.” This is a general sequencing/priority statement, not a specific plan or direct explanation of how the administration will address exiles’ property claims. It partially engages the topic (acknowledges property confiscation and suggests it comes later), but remains non-specific and deflects from the requested details."

In the answer, the President first says Cuba is not transparent and that he only knows speculation about Castro’s condition, repeatedly stating “I don’t know. I really don’t know.” He then shifts to broad principles about supporting Cuban self-determination and a general sequence (“first things first”) before Cuban Americans address property issues. Nowhere does he describe any concrete contingency plans, preparations, steps, or policies the administration would implement upon Castro’s death. The response provides values and a general stance, but it does not give the requested contingency plan information at all, effectively declining/avoiding that part of the question."

Expressing belief in the assurances functions as an explicit endorsement of them and indicates satisfaction with those assurances.

The president mostly describes what has been done (commitment, $110B, assistance categories, progress on debris removal). On what remains, he only implicitly indicates ongoing needs: recovery will “take a while,” they are “now in the process” of removing water-related debris, and Louisiana is “slower” with debris removal and should “get after it.” This suggests remaining work (continued recovery and debris removal, especially in Louisiana), but it is partial and not explicitly structured as “what remains to be done” across the broader recovery effort. Therefore, the response is incomplete/implicit rather than a direct, specific answer to the remaining-work question."

2. The answer does not directly explain “because UN resolutions X/Y provide the legal/political framework to end occupation” or any explicit reason tied to accepting UN resolutions.  
3. Instead, the respondent pivots to a different framing: negotiate in good faith with elected leaders, notes “the U.N. deal didn’t work in the past,” and emphasizes a negotiated two-state solution and offering hope to defeat terrorism.  
4. Mentioning that UN approaches “didn’t work” is relevant background, but it does not answer why the request is being made; if anything, it undercuts the premise rather than providing the requested justification.

91,The potential complications in keeping pressure on Iran's sanctions at the United Nations,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,True,False,True,True,Ambivalent,"The specific question asks whether the President’s approach (treating Iran differently under the NPT) will “complicate the efforts to keep the pressure on when it comes to sanctions at the United Nations.” A clear reply would explicitly address the likelihood of complications for sustaining UN sanctions pressure (e.g., “yes, it will complicate because X” or “no, it won’t because Y,” possibly with concrete references to UN dynamics). In the answer, the President largely reframes the issue: he emphasizes Iran’s past concealment, lack of transparency, defiance of agreements/IAEA, and argues this is “all the more reason for the international community to continue to work together.” This implies he believes pressure can be maintained, but he does not directly discuss UN sanctions mechanics, whether it will be harder to keep consensus, or acknowledge/deny complications in explicit terms. He shifts into broader talking points about diplomacy, leadership change, and willingness to talk if Iran suspends enrichment. Thus, the response is related but indirect and does not squarely answer the “will it complicate UN sanctions pressure?” part in a specific, explicit way."

He also explicitly cites accomplishments he views as significant: Medicare reform (prescription drug benefit/health care reform), No Child Left Behind as an education accomplishment, keeping taxes low while cutting the deficit, and references an “ideological struggle” framing. While he also digresses into process/legacy commentary, the requested information—other areas of transformation—is explicitly supplied through these specific policy domains and achievements."

In the answer, the president does not directly address Americans’ frustration in a clear, second-person reassurance or explanation tailored to them. He instead (1) refuses a hypothetical about the G-8/UN track, (2) talks generally about being firm with Iran, (3) mentions he spoke with Putin and that Putin understands the danger, and (4) offers a broad explanation that some nations are less comfortable with sanctions due to economic interests and that the U.S. objective is to get national security interests to trump economic interests, which “sometimes…takes a while.” This partially engages the substance (why roadblocks happen; patience/pressure), but it does not explicitly answer “what do you say to Americans” in a direct, concrete way.

While it doesn’t give detailed leverage or concessions, it does provide a specific approach rather than avoiding the question."

In the answer, the speaker describes market turbulence and asserts Mexico’s financial system is “solid enough to resist,” and says the situation is “beginning to stabilize.” This gives a general outlook but does not explicitly state how close they are to a “crash” (no concrete assessment of proximity or likelihood). On measures, he mainly says extraordinary liquidity support “has not been necessary” in Mexico and notes other central banks have injected liquidity; he does not list concrete policy actions his government has taken to protect the real economy beyond general claims of system solidity and past work to strengthen it. He also shifts to a second topic (dialog with legislators). Thus, the response is partial and general, with no specific measures and no direct “how close” answer."

In the answer, he does not directly justify repeating a “relationship” claim in the face of contrary intelligence. Instead, he reframes what he meant: he says his point was that Iraq was a state sponsor of terror and that Zarqawi was in Iraq, and he asserts, “I never said there was an operational relationship.” He then pivots to broader arguments about Saddam being dangerous, harboring terrorists, and the rationale for removing him, plus a denial about 9/11 orders. This partially addresses the premise by redefining “relationship” (presence/harboring vs operational link), but it does not squarely answer why he “kept saying” there was a relationship despite the report; it’s more a correction/deflection than a direct explanation."

In the answer, he directly engages that premise by referencing the NIE key judgments and acknowledging that the enemy is exploiting Iraq as propaganda and recruitment. He then explains his rationale for still claiming increased safety: he argues that going on the offense against terrorists increases safety; terrorists fight in Iraq to stop democracy and because the stakes are high; and even without Iraq they would recruit and attack anyway, citing pre-Iraq attacks (1993 WTC, 9/11, embassy bombings) and other past “excuses” used for recruitment (Somalia, Israeli-Palestinian conflict). This is a substantive, explicit explanation of “why” he maintains his position, even if one might dispute it. It is not a refusal, not vague to the point of non-answer, and it addresses the core “why” question."

He also says he will “sprint to the finish” and “work hard” in the last two years. While he doesn’t explicitly address the “’08 candidates doing their thing” part or describe procedural tactics for “keeping control,” he does provide a substantive governing strategy (bipartisan cooperation + specified legislative priorities) for operating under divided government. That constitutes an explicit, concrete plan responsive to the core of the question, even if not perfectly comprehensive."
117,What led you to that conclusion?,Clear Reply,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,True,False,True,True,Clear Reply,"The question asks for the basis/evidence: “What led you to that conclusion?” In the answer, the speaker does provide reasons for why he speculated the culture might be changing: (1) his personal observation while “working the ropelines” that “a lot of people come and say… I’m praying for you,” and that it seems “a lot more now than… in 1994”; (2) he had “just read a book on Abraham Lincoln” about the “Second Awakening,” which prompted him to wonder about historical parallels; and (3) his broader framing about trying to change culture toward a “responsibility era,” plus his impression that “something is happening in the religious life of America.” These are concrete, explicit drivers of his conclusion/speculation, even if he qualifies them as anecdotal and not a “very good focus group.” Because he directly states what led him to think this, the requested information is provided."

The question asks for a commitment to “building the 700 miles of fence, actual fencing” (i.e., a direct yes/no on whether he will build the physical fence as specified).  
2. The answer opens with an explicit commitment: “Yes, we’re going to do both,” and then reiterates “we’re actually building fence, and we’re building double fence… in areas where there is a high vulnerability.”  
3. However, he immediately qualifies the scope and placement: “You can’t fence the entire border,” and emphasizes a “combination of fencing and technology,” suggesting fencing will be targeted rather than uniformly built to a fixed mileage.  
4. He never explicitly reaffirms the specific “700 miles” figure in his answer; instead he commits to some actual fencing plus technology, placed “where it works.”  
5. Because the response gives a general commitment to physical fencing but does not clearly commit to the specific 700-mile physical fence requirement as asked, it is incomplete/qualified relative to the precise question."

The President begins with “No,” which appears to be a direct answer, but he does not explicitly tie that “No” to the asked impact on credibility/effectiveness/elections. Instead, he pivots to praising Hastert’s “strong statements,” emphasizing fact-finding, condemning Foley’s behavior, and saying they want to know what Republicans and Democrats knew. He never directly states that Hastert’s credibility/effectiveness has *not* been damaged, nor does he address “maintaining party control” or “midterm elections” in concrete terms.

In the answer, he says his “patience ran out on President Asad a long time ago” and “if he's listening, he doesn't need a phone call. He knows exactly what my position is.” This strongly implies he is not inclined to call or speak with Asad, but he never explicitly states “No, I am not willing to speak to him” (nor does he explicitly say he would). He then shifts into broader commentary about Syria’s behavior and Lebanon’s political process, further avoiding a direct commitment.

- The answer explicitly addresses complexity: “it offers an opportunity as well as a challenge,” and then explains the “challenge” as democracy being “messy” and requiring negotiating with “a wider range of views.” This directly affirms that it has made things more complicated (at least in part).  
- However, the respondent does not give a clean yes/no to “has it made it more complicated”; instead they balance it with opportunity and conclude they “like the odds” of a better outcome. This is a qualified, mixed assessment rather than a direct, unambiguous reply to the specific yes/no framing.  
- Because the complication point is stated but embedded in a both-sides framing (opportunity + challenge) without a direct yes/no, the response is not maximally explicit in the requested form."

Instead, he reframes: he emphasizes consistency (“policy hasn’t changed”), the value of clarity to rally diplomacy, and argues the words are not empty because diplomacy with allies has changed the “diplomatic scenario” for Iran and North Korea. This is an implicit denial of fecklessness (suggesting the warnings are backed by diplomatic action), but it does not directly address the reputational-risk question in a concrete, explicit way; it largely pivots to explaining strategy and progress and then to military-action considerations.

In the answer provided, he does not explicitly say “yes, I have been effective” or “no, I have not,” nor does he directly evaluate his leadership. Instead, he pivots to describing actions taken (trade bills, patent reform), defending the American Jobs Act, criticizing Republicans’ rationale, and stating “we’re going to keep on pushing,” plus mentioning steps absent congressional action (truncated). These points imply he believes he is acting effectively, but the requested evaluative judgment is not stated directly.

In the answer’s second part, he says he has invited legislators and seeks constructive dialogue, but “still haven’t received a positive answer” to the invitation (the rest is truncated). This reports the current status (no positive response yet) but does not explicitly state his belief or trust about what the opposition *will* do going forward (e.g., “yes, I think they will” or “no, I don’t think they will”).

In the answer, the speaker clearly acknowledges Iraq is “no question… tough,” “serious,” and “no question this is an issue,” which indicates it matters politically. However, he does not explicitly say it is (or is not) the *biggest* drag. Instead, he pivots to say “but so is the economy,” and then reframes the campaign around “the two biggest issues… the economy… [and] security,” effectively broadening/redirecting rather than ranking Iraq as the top drag. The listener can infer he’s resisting the premise that Iraq is the single biggest drag, but that conclusion is not stated directly."

200,Influence of U.S.-Russian relationship on world politics: How has this relationship affected world politics?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,Clear Reply,True,False,False,True,Clear Reply,"The specific question asks: “How has the U.S.-Russian relationship influenced world politics?” In the answer, the speaker directly addresses the broader impact beyond the bilateral relationship. He contrasts the Cold War/Cuban Missile Crisis era with today, stating a crisis like that is now “unthinkable,” and that the two countries no longer see each other as enemies but as partners. He then links this relationship to concrete areas of cooperation—counterterrorism, nonproliferation/WMD and missile technology, and combating drugs—saying these efforts “create a reliable platform for cooperation” that “contributes to ensuring international security.” He also adds that improved relations have benefited “the world as a whole.” These are explicit claims about the relationship’s effect on global politics/security, not merely vague platitudes, and they directly answer the “how” question (by reducing great-power confrontation and enabling cooperation on major international security issues)."

The president begins with “No,” which signals rejection of the premise, but he does not explicitly say “No, it’s not because we’re overtasked.” Instead, he offers alternative reasons: historical context in Lebanon, willingness to provide logistics/command-and-control, and a broader rationale (as with Darfur) that deploying U.S. troops can create a “sensation” that undermines objectives. This implies the decision is based on optics/strategic effectiveness rather than troop capacity, but the “overtasked” point is not directly addressed with a concrete statement about military workload. Therefore, the answer is an indirect/implicit denial rather than an explicit one to the specific “overtasked” question."

In the answer, he does not directly state his own intended action in the form asked (e.g., “No, I will not allow a shutdown” or “Yes, I’m prepared to let it happen”). Instead, he shifts agency to Congress (“Congress makes the decisions… they have the votes… they’re going to have to make a decision”), and offers evaluative commentary (“that would be a mistake… damaging”) rather than a clear commitment about what he would do. On blame, he gives a more direct but still qualified view: “I suspect that the American people would blame all of Washington,” which answers the second part. Because the response addresses blame but does not clearly answer the core “are you prepared to allow it” component and largely deflects to Congress and broader deficit themes, the overall response is incomplete/deflective rather than fully responsive."

In the answer provided, the speaker discusses avoiding a vacuum, addressing root causes, deploying Lebanese government forces and an international force, supporting the Siniora government, and broader themes about democracy and liberty. There is no explicit statement about whether Rice will contact Berri, no commitment (“yes, I will”), no denial (“no, I won’t”), and no explanation of plans to reach out. The response shifts to broader policy framing rather than addressing the outreach question. Therefore, the requested information is not provided, but the speaker does not explicitly refuse or claim ignorance; it’s a deflection/dodge."

In the answer, the speaker states they should jointly try to persuade North Korea not to launch, and if it launches, “we would apply various pressures,” while explicitly refusing to specify what those pressures are. The speaker also says they will “maintain close cooperation and coordination with the United States,” mentions the U.N. as a venue to express common concern, and points to cooperation on missile defenses as an “interesting opportunity.” These elements do describe forms of cooperation (coordination/diplomatic efforts, potential U.N. engagement, missile defense cooperation), but they remain broad and non-specific, and the key actionable part (“pressures”) is withheld. Therefore, the response addresses the question but only in a general/partial way rather than providing concrete specifics."

In the answer, the speaker (1) acknowledges awareness of the movement (“I’ve heard of it…seen it on television”), (2) characterizes what it represents (“expresses the frustrations…people are frustrated…protestors are giving voice”), and (3) pivots into a defense/explanation of his administration’s actions and policy rationale (why saving banks was necessary; what Dodd-Frank is designed to do). What’s missing is an explicit, second-person or directive statement addressed to the supporters (e.g., “I would tell them X,” “Here’s what I’d say to them,” “They should…”). The response provides context and justification and implicitly suggests “your frustration is understandable and we’re addressing it via Dodd-Frank,” but it does not clearly deliver the requested “what would you say” message in a concrete, direct form. That makes it an incomplete/implicit reply rather than a fully direct one."

However, there is no explicit statement of what Russia *would do* in response if the U.S. went ahead regardless, and there is no addressed content about Russia’s response to Ukraine and Georgia joining NATO.

In the answer, he does not give a direct “yes” or “no,” but he does explicitly clarify what he means by “relationship”: he says Zarqawi “was in Iraq,” Saddam was a “state sponsor of terror,” and “He harbored terrorists,” while also stating, “I never said there was an operational relationship.” This amounts to an implicit, qualified affirmation of a non-operational connection (presence/harboring), but he avoids directly stating “I still believe there was a relationship between Saddam, Zarqawi, and Al Qaida” in the form asked. Because the requested information is only provided indirectly and with reframing/qualification rather than a direct answer, it is incomplete/implicit rather than explicit."

In the answer, the speaker repeatedly says they cannot tell what is on his mind and that they “don’t know… his intentions.” They discuss the closed nature of the society, general threats (proliferation, WMD), and planning/alliances, but they never provide an opinion or judgment on the incentives-to-Iran comparison. The closest they come is explicitly stating ignorance about intentions, which directly avoids the requested assessment. This is not a partial substantive answer; it is a refusal/claim of inability to know."

The specific classification target is the alignment between the President’s perspective and the Defense Secretary’s response. In the answer, the President does not accept the premise that Gates is unsure; he reframes Gates’s position by citing Gates’s “previous statements” that removing Saddam was the right decision. He then explicitly states he has not talked to Gates about the column. He further asserts he is “absolutely convinced” Gates believes removing Saddam was right and that they will succeed, signaling alignment rather than disagreement. Although he does not directly address “second-guessing” or “does that change your mind” in explicit terms, on the alignment point he clearly states there is no daylight and that Gates agrees with him (as the President characterizes it).

The answer does not lay out a specific mechanism for securing mutual support (e.g., what concessions, changes to the draft, negotiation steps, or guarantees would bring both sides on board). Instead, it shifts to broad statements about shared desire to stop violence, the “intent” and “root causes” the resolution should address (strengthening the Lebanese government, limiting Hizballah), and notes that “both parties aren't going to agree with all aspects,” while emphasizing the goal of developing a resolution “that can get passed.” This is more a general framing and justification of U.S. objectives than a direct, specific plan for obtaining support from both sides.

He then starts to pivot toward the “specific question” with “as you know, to answer your specific question, the Government of Canada is not prepared to open a missi...” but the transcript is truncated before he actually states the requested position on joining BMD (e.g., “yes, still wrong/not in our interest” or “no, I’ve changed my view,” or an explicit statement that Canada will/won’t join).

He then pivots to praising Bernanke and discussing fiscal policy and taxes, but never states whether the rate cut was sufficient or insufficient.

In the answer, the speaker discusses general “strategizing,” references prior Russian proposals (fuel supply/take-back), says they talked about a U.N. Security Council resolution, but explicitly refuses to give “the particulars about the conversation.” He then states there is “common agreement that we need to get something done at the U.N.” and expresses confidence they can do that, plus general opposition to proliferation.

The president begins with “No,” which directly rejects the premise. He then offers alternative reasons: historical experience with U.S. troops in Lebanon, willingness to provide logistics/command-and-control instead, and a broader rationale that deploying U.S. troops can “create a sensation around the world” that could hinder objectives (illustrated with Darfur). While he doesn’t explicitly say “it’s not about credibility,” the initial “No” functions as a direct denial of that suggested reason, and he supplies other concrete reasons for the decision.

The answer does offer some action-oriented elements: it says the “short-term solution is for Hizballah to stop the attacks,” and it includes “I call upon Syria to exert influence over Hizballah,” plus a broader “longer-term solution” that nations should “support those who support the advance of democracy.” It also gestures toward a balancing principle on force (“use of force should be balanced”). However, these points are largely framed as what Hizballah, Syria, and “nations around the world” should do, not specifically what Bush and Putin will do (e.g., specific joint steps, diplomatic measures, leverage, negotiations, ceasefire mechanisms). The response also spends substantial time explaining causes and justifying Israel’s concerns rather than directly detailing actionable steps by the two presidents, and it does not directly engage the “divisions among allies” aspect beyond a general statement about balancing force. Thus, it partially addresses the question but not in a specific, direct way about what Bush and Putin can do."

In the answer, the speaker does provide content for both sides, but unevenly. For the Republican-retains scenario, he points to the current strong economy and attributes it to Republican policies: cutting taxes, fiscal responsibility, cutting the deficit, and making tax cuts permanent to provide certainty and encourage spending/job creation. For the Democrats-take-over scenario, he predicts they would raise taxes (even if framed as taxing the rich), which would hit small businesses and hurt job creation. However, he also spends substantial time avoiding the hypothetical (“I shouldn't answer your hypothetical”) and largely frames the Republican side as a defense of past performance rather than a clear forward-looking “what will happen if they retain control,” and the “contrast” is not laid out in a clean, side-by-side way. Still, the core contrast can be inferred: Republicans = continue tax cuts/fiscal restraint leading to growth; Democrats = raise taxes harming jobs."

268,Expectations of success for the new security crackdown in Baghdad,Clear Reply,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,True,False,True,True,Clear Reply,"The specific question asks why one should expect the new Baghdad security crackdown to succeed when previous ones failed. The answer directly addresses this by giving concrete reasons the speaker claims make the current plan different: (1) changed political circumstances—there is now a national unity government with representation from all segments, plus a parliament and constitution—so the plan has broader political/popular support than earlier efforts; (2) operational claims—security forces have already eliminated “many hotspots,” and success will be ensured by monitoring conditions on the ground; (3) command-and-resourcing changes—greater flexibility for commanders, decisions based on General Casey’s recommendations, an increase in U.S. troops alongside Iraqi troops, and provision of more equipment. These points are explicitly offered as reasons for expecting improved success compared to prior crackdowns. While the response also drifts into troop levels and general “conditions change” rhetoric, it still provides a substantive, specific rationale for expected success."
269,Did you discuss the possibility of referring the matter to the U.N. Security Council?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,True,False,True,True,Ambivalent,"The question asks for a specific factual confirmation: whether they discussed referring the North Korea missile matter to the U.N. Security Council. In the answer, the speaker says “we discussed that” in reference to applying “various pressures” if a missile is launched, but then refuses to give specifics. Later, the speaker mentions “the U.N. is an opportunity to express our common concern,” which gestures toward the UN generally, but does not explicitly state that they discussed a Security Council referral. There is no clear “yes, we discussed referring it” or “no, we did not.” The closest relevant content is vague/implicit and could include many UN-related actions, not necessarily a Security Council referral. Therefore the response is incomplete and non-specific relative to the precise question."

In the answer, he directly addresses that: he distinguishes campaigning from governing, says he will work with both parties, won’t hold grudges, and intends to “start visiting with her on Friday, with the idea of coming together.” He also cites that Pelosi told him she wants to work together, and he frames the method as focusing on the “big picture” and specific legislative areas (e.g., reauthorizing No Child Left Behind) where they can collaborate. This provides a concrete plan/approach (meet, move past insults, focus on shared governance tasks and specific policy work), not a refusal or mere deflection."

In the answer, the President explicitly addresses civilian casualties first and states: “I can assure the Afghan people, like I assured the President, that we do everything that we can to protect the innocent… and we adjust accordingly.” He also says they discussed Karzai’s concerns and “I assured him that we share those concerns.” These statements directly indicate that he did provide assurances to Karzai regarding efforts to reduce civilian casualties (doing everything possible, adjusting operations, sharing concerns). While he does not detail specific policy changes or metrics, the question is about whether assurances were given, and he explicitly says they were."

In his response, Kikwete does not provide that interpretation. He notes that “people talk with excitement of Obama,” but then pivots to a different point: that their “excitement is that President Bush is at the end of his term” and that, whoever becomes president, Africa wants the next U.S. president to be “as good friend of Africa as President Bush has been.” This addresses African hopes about U.S. policy and the transition, not what Obama’s potential election signifies about America. There is no explicit statement answering the “what does it say about America” part, nor even an implicit evaluation of America’s racial progress or values. Therefore, the requested information is not given."

The answer directly engages that premise: he rejects the “everything was fine until we arrived / hornet’s nest” theory and argues the region and terrorist threat were already dangerous (terrorists killed 3,000 Americans before the “freedom agenda”). He also provides his reconciliation logic: even if WMD stockpiles weren’t found, Saddam had capacity/intent and posed a threat; therefore the consequences of withdrawal must be weighed against the risk of Saddam remaining in power and broader pre-existing terrorism. This is a substantive, explicit attempt to square the two ideas, not a refusal or a topic change, even if it relies on hypotheticals and contested assertions."

The answer given is a clarifying question: “On Iran?” This does not provide any information about confidence, Maliki’s views, or Iraq.

In the answer, he says they “strategized on both issues,” that they “talked about the U.N. Security Council resolution,” and that there is “common agreement that we need to get something done at the U.N.” on both Iran and North Korea, and that they are “working on language.” However, he explicitly refuses to provide “the particulars” of the conversation and does not specify any concrete steps taken, commitments secured, or outcomes achieved that would clearly demonstrate “moving forward.” The response indicates general progress/coordination but remains broad and non-specific relative to what the question seeks."
306," Is there anything that's disappointed you about the recovery, the Federal response?",Ambivalent,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,True,False,True,True,Ambivalent,"The question asks for any disappointments about the recovery or the federal response. The answer does not explicitly state a disappointment (e.g., “Yes, I’m disappointed about X” or “No, nothing has disappointed me”). Instead, the speaker describes initial concern about funding willingness, expresses pleasure with the $110 billion commitment, and then shifts to explaining administrative/bureaucratic issues (debris removal rules) and anticipated public frustration about rebuilding funds. These points gesture toward potential problems (bureaucratic obstacles, frustration over rebuilding money), but they are framed as concerns and process explanations rather than a direct statement of what has “disappointed” him. The response is therefore indirect and incomplete relative to the question."
307,Why shouldn't Americans see the U.S. policy regarding North Korea as a failed one?,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,Clear Reply,False,True,True,True,Clear Reply,"The question asks for a justification for why Americans should not view U.S. North Korea policy as a failure. The answer provides a direct reason: “Because it takes time to get things done.” This addresses the “why” by asserting that outcomes require time, implying it’s premature to label the policy a failure. Although the justification is vague and not supported with specifics, it still explicitly gives a reason responsive to the question rather than refusing, deflecting, or answering a different question."
