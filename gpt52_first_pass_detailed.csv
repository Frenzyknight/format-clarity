0,Do you think that is a good thing?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks for an evaluative judgment (“is that a good thing?”). The President answers directly, “I think it’s a good thing,” which explicitly addresses the question; the subsequent remarks are supporting context.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
1,"Mr. President, have you any ideas on what should be done with the evidence turned up on Senator McCarthy by that subcommittee?",Ambivalent,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The question asks for the President’s ideas on what should be done with the evidence. He does not provide any ideas or recommendations; instead he notes the Justice Department is investigating and explicitly says he has “no comment.”
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
2,Does the Prime Minister feel that that would have a major impact on the peace talks?,Ambivalent,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The question asks for the Prime Minister’s assessment of the impact on peace talks. The Prime Minister refuses to engage, saying he doesn’t deal with American domestic political/personal problems, providing no view on the impact.
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
3,Do you think the advantages all around would outweigh the risks or the embarrassments?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks for a judgment on whether advantages outweigh risks/embarrassments. The President explicitly answers “Oh, yes, I think so,” directly affirming that advantages outweigh the downsides, and then adds supporting context from experience.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
4,So he said those things under oath?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The specific question asks for confirmation that “he” said those things under oath. The answer does not confirm or deny that fact; instead it shifts to denying Trump’s own statements (“I didn’t say under oath…”) and argues it doesn’t make sense. This is a deflection rather than a direct confirmation.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
5,Would you be willing to speak under oath to give your version of those events?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: He explicitly answers the core yes/no question with “One-hundred percent,” indicating willingness to speak under oath. The rest is additional denial/deflection about the allegation, but the requested willingness is clearly stated.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
6,Do you agree that the next step against Iran should be sanctions if Iran fails to comply with the Security Council's 30-day deadline on its nuclear program?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: Bush does not explicitly say whether he agrees sanctions should be the next step if Iran misses the deadline. He talks generally about shared goals, unity, and strategy discussions, but avoids committing to sanctions as the specific next action.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
7,Have you signed the commission for United States Attorney for Mr. Johnson of Nevada?,Ambivalent,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether the President has signed the commission. He says he doesn’t remember whether he has, providing no definitive yes/no and indicating uncertainty.
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
8,Do you think that Reagan is running a campaign of hatred and racism?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The interviewer asks whether Reagan is running a campaign of hatred and racism. The President explicitly answers “No” and reiterates he does not think Reagan is running a campaign of racism or hatred, directly addressing the question.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
9,How do you answer allegations that you are running a mean campaign?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: He directly addresses the allegation by stating his campaign is “very moderate in its tone” and explains he avoided raising divisive “code words,” which serves as a concrete defense against the “mean campaign” charge.  
LABEL: Clear Reply"
10,Are you sorry that more countries did not take a more active part in the effort to help South Vietnam?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: He directly answers “Yes” to whether he is sorry, and elaborates by wishing every participating country and SEATO signatories had helped more. The later shift to population issues is irrelevant, but the core question is clearly answered.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
11,Are you going to do it now?,Clear Non-Reply,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The answer does not provide any information about whether they will do it now; it only asks for clarification (“What?”), indicating the question wasn’t understood or needs restating.  
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
12,You have said the Ford administration is the only one that has done anything.,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question concerns a broad claim that the Ford administration is the only one to have “done anything.” The answer does not directly affirm or explain that broad claim; it narrows it to a specific, technical point about requiring companies to “put their name on the line,” offering only a qualified confirmation rather than addressing the overall assertion.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
13,Can you explain to Canadians——,Clear Reply,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The interviewer asks for an explanation to Canadians, but the president does not provide any explanation. He instead asks for clarification (“Which one?”), indicating the requested information is not given.
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
14,When is that?,Ambivalent,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The interviewer asks for a specific time (“When is that?”). The response does not provide any timing information and instead challenges the interviewer, offering no substantive answer.
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
15,Is that in public?,Clear Reply,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The interviewer asks whether “that” is in public. Trump does not provide any information about whether it is public; instead he challenges the interviewer and asks if they have a question.  
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
16,Could you elaborate on the strategic partnership between the two countries?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: He does elaborate by giving concrete reasons for the partnership’s strategic value (maintaining Israel’s military qualitative edge, Israel as a democratic and reliable ally, usefulness in unpredictable crises, and that the relationship serves U.S. security interests). Although he says he won’t elaborate further, he has already provided substantive elaboration.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
17,Do you believe Israel has strategic importance to the United States in the aftermath of the Cold War?,Clear Reply,Clear Reply,"REASONING: He explicitly answers “I do,” and then directly explains why Israel is strategically important (military qualitative edge, reliable ally, U.S. security interest after the Cold War). This squarely addresses the question.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
18,Still any problems that have to be worked out?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether there are still problems to be worked out. The answer says “None,” but then qualifies it by mentioning occasional “hiccups” and “differences on trading problems,” without specifying concrete unresolved problems. This is a qualified, somewhat inconsistent response that only partially addresses the question.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
19,Do the legal mechanisms of NAFTA provide it with strength so that it is not put aside by decree?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks specifically whether NAFTA’s legal mechanisms make it resistant to being undone “by decree.” The response instead emphasizes NAFTA’s economic benefits, growth in trade, and the desirability of updating/modernizing the agreement, without addressing the legal durability or procedural constraints on withdrawal/termination.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
20,"President Obama, what pending issues do you have in your administration that you would have liked to complete?",Ambivalent,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The question asks President Obama to name pending issues he wished to complete. The provided response is from President Peña Nieto and discusses NAFTA/free trade benefits and modernization; it does not address Obama’s unfinished agenda or mention any pending issues at all.  
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
21,We understand that you have had a number of offers?,Clear Reply,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether he has had a number of offers. He explicitly confirms this (“That’s correct”), even though he adds he hasn’t decided what to do.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
22,And about his role in Syria and the region?,Ambivalent,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The interviewer asks about “his role in Syria and the region,” but the respondent requests clarification (“Whose role?”) rather than providing any information about the role.
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
23,"They don't decide anything, do they?",Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks for confirmation (“They don't decide anything, do they?”). The answer “No.” directly and explicitly responds in the requested yes/no form.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
24,Do we have any reason to believe that the Vietcong offer to exchange prisoners had any substance to it?,Clear Reply,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The President explicitly declines to comment and provides no information about whether there is reason to believe the offer had substance.  
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
25,You said you wanted to hear more.,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The specific prompt “You said you wanted to hear more” calls for what he wanted to hear more about (i.e., clarification of that earlier statement). The response instead pivots to what worries him about the plan (Hamas’s stance) and then discusses humanitarian aid mechanisms. It does not explicitly answer what he meant by wanting “to hear more.”  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
26,Is there anything that worries you about this plan?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: Bush directly identifies a specific concern: Hamas’s stated desire to destroy Israel and its refusal to recognize Israel’s right to exist, explaining why that undermines a two-state plan. This explicitly answers what worries him about the plan (despite beginning with “No,” he then states the worry).
LABEL: Clear Reply"
27,Are you willing to risk another jolt to the economy from this large price increase?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether he is willing to risk an economic jolt from the price increase (a yes/no with justification). He does not state willingness directly; instead he reframes by arguing the alternative would be a bigger jolt (job losses, cold houses), implying justification without explicitly answering.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
28,You mean that you are not going to write them immediately?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks for a yes/no confirmation about not writing them immediately. The answer “No” directly responds in the requested form and clearly indicates the opposite of the interviewer’s assumption.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
29,How far will that extend--off the Continental Shelf?,Clear Non-Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks how far the extension goes beyond the Continental Shelf. The answer doesn’t give any distance or boundary beyond the shelf; it only restates that the claim is to the Continental Shelf, effectively not addressing “off the Continental Shelf.”
LABEL: Ambivalent"
30,Do you think the return of the Republicans to power means a realignment of the political parties after the 4 years?,Clear Reply,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks for the interviewee’s view on whether Republican return to power means a party realignment. The answer directly states “No, I don’t,” which clearly gives the requested yes/no judgment.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
31,Are there any estimates at all of the amount potentially that might be saved as a result of the directives being issued today?,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for an estimate of potential savings. The President explicitly says he did not ask for an estimate and that Treasury is trying to produce one later; he provides no savings figure now, only general context and an unrelated statistic about dependents abroad.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
32,Do you see the chance that the United States would exercise its option to withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty if it is not possible to negotiate changes to permit a national missile defense?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether he sees a possibility the U.S. would withdraw from the ABM Treaty if negotiations fail. Clinton does not directly state yes or no; instead he says he hasn’t decided on missile defense and emphasizes he does not *want* to withdraw and prefers bridging differences. This implies reluctance but does not explicitly address the contingency of failed negotiations or acknowledge the chance of withdrawal.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
33,Was this possibility raised in your discussions with President Putin?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: Clinton discusses his general stance on missile defense and withdrawing from the ABM “regime,” but he never directly states whether the possibility of withdrawal was raised in his discussions with President Putin. This is a dodge/implicit non-answer to the specific question.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
34,"In light of his speech yesterday at the U.N., are there any new steps that we can take to continue the arms reduction process?",Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for any new steps to continue arms reduction. The answer signals a general direction—after settling START, pursue negotiations on reducing conventional weapons—but does not specify concrete “new steps” or actions beyond an expressed goal, and it’s contingent on another issue being settled.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
35,Does your note establish a precedent--asking for a conference with your successor?,Ambivalent,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: He says “I have no idea,” which explicitly indicates he cannot answer whether it sets a precedent, and then shifts to a general statement about cooperation without addressing the precedent question.
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
36,Is there a specific situation in which the U.S. Government might consider giving Colombia military support to fight the guerrillas?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: Clinton directly answers the question by stating that Plan Colombia “does not contemplate that” and explicitly says “the answer is no,” rejecting the possibility of U.S. military support to fight guerrillas under the authorized plan.  
LABEL: Clear Reply"
37,Will we renew her tourist visa?,Clear Reply,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks directly whether her tourist visa will be renewed. The President answers explicitly “Yes,” which clearly provides the requested information.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
38,How effective can these National Guard troops be if they're shuttling in and out of the border area every two or three weeks?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks about effectiveness given frequent rotation. Bush answers by asserting the Guard will enable Border Patrol to do its job better and describes roles (support functions, interim service, not straining capacity), but he does not directly address the “shuttling in and out every two or three weeks” concern or explain how rotations affect effectiveness.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
39,How are you going to turn around these House Members who seem to be unswayed by your argument on the guest-worker program?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for a concrete plan to persuade House Members. Bush shifts to explaining why a temporary-worker program is important to border security and reiterates policy rationale, but does not state specific steps (e.g., meetings, negotiations, concessions, outreach strategy) for “turning around” unswayed House Members. The persuasion aspect is addressed only indirectly and generally.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
40,Do you have a specific target for how much you want that violence to be reduced?,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for a specific quantitative or clearly defined target for reducing violence. The answer gives only a vague goal (“enough for the Government to succeed”) and shifts into broader discussion about Iraqi confidence and troop policy, without stating any specific target level or metric.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
41,"Mr. President, would you keep both him and Mr. Kelley in their jobs?",Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether he would keep both individuals in their jobs. The President explicitly answers “Yes,” directly addressing the yes/no question, and then provides justification (focused on Kelley).
LABEL: Clear Reply"
42,"What do you feel about Russia's continuation of reducing within START III the number of warheads down to 1,500 warheads?",Ambivalent,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: Clinton says he missed the translation and asks for the question to be repeated, so he does not provide any view on Russia’s START III reductions.
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
43,Can you now envision a time of real peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The president answers affirmatively, stating “absolutely” and that “we are optimistic about the chances for peace,” which directly conveys he can envision real peace, though without a concrete timeline.  
LABEL: Clear Reply"
44,To what extent has a new government in Israel contributed to this process?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: He attributes a positive contribution to the new Israeli government (“very forthright,” “continue the peace negotiations,” “let’s meet; let’s talk”) but does not specify the extent in concrete or measurable terms; it’s a general endorsement rather than a detailed assessment.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
45,Have you reached a decision in the Rosenberg case?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether he has reached a decision. He explicitly states the case has not come to him and therefore he cannot reach a decision yet—i.e., no decision has been made.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
46,Did you seriously consider naming Arthur Goldberg as Chief Justice after the Fortas nomination was withdrawn?,Clear Reply,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether the President seriously considered naming Arthur Goldberg after the Fortas nomination was withdrawn. The answer explicitly says “Yes,” which directly addresses the question (and adds that he considered it even before as well).
LABEL: Clear Reply"
47,Have you received any reply from Governor Roosevelt?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether a reply was received from Governor Roosevelt. The answer explicitly says “No,” directly addressing the question with a clear yes/no.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
48,My question is about the Supreme Court.,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question signals a topic (the Supreme Court) but requests no specific information yet. The response (“I’m shocked”) is a reaction and does not address the Supreme Court or provide any substantive information related to it.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
49,"Could you tell us why it took you 6 days and four clarifications before you finally admitted that you had, in fact, made a mistake in the debate in your remarks on Eastern Europe?",Clear Non-Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for a specific explanation for the delay (“why it took 6 days and four clarifications”). The President does not directly explain the timeline; instead he generally says it required “thoughtful analysis,” cites a supportive letter, and shifts to reaffirming his views about Poland and Soviet divisions. This is a deflection and lacks a concrete reason for the delay.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
50,Could you characterize the worry you heard from Iraqi leaders about U.S. troop levels that you first mentioned on the flight home from Iraq?,Ambivalent,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The President does not characterize the worry; he asks for the first part of the question to be repeated, indicating he needs clarification/repetition rather than providing the requested information.
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
51,"After your visit, do you truly believe that the tide is turning in Iraq?",Clear Reply,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The interviewer asks whether the President truly believes the tide is turning in Iraq. The President does not answer that; instead he asks for clarification/repetition of the “first part of the question,” providing no substantive response to the specific question.
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
52,How do you feel about leaving Camp David?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks for his feelings about leaving Camp David. He directly states he expects he’d feel “sad” about leaving (even though he notes it hasn’t happened yet) and elaborates positively about the retreat. This provides a clear emotional answer.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
53,You are including the Southern Democrats in progressives?,Clear Reply,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether Southern Democrats are included among progressives. The answer explicitly says “Yes, I am including the Southern Democrats,” directly addressing the question in the requested form.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
54,"Is this perhaps not time to go the inch in [Arafat’s] direction and start some kind of talks with Mr. Arafat rather than, as Mr. Shultz did, close the door on him?",Clear Reply,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether the President will now start talks with Arafat. The President answers “No,” explains that Arafat’s statements still have loopholes, says talks would be possible only if Arafat clearly recognizes Israel and meets conditions, and adds that U.S. law currently bars a visa/waiver. This directly addresses why it is not time to begin talks yet and sets explicit conditions for when it would be.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
55,So you don't expect to bring up human rights?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether he expects to bring up human rights. Biden directly answers that he will and says he always brings up human rights, adding his stance on Khashoggi. This explicitly addresses the question.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
56,"Have you decided, sir, on how you are going to deliver the State of the Union Message?",Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether the President has decided how to deliver the State of the Union. The answer “No.” directly and explicitly states he has not decided.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
57,"Mr. President, how did you try to convince the Prime Minister today that that kind of violations of human rights will stop and guilty will be prosecuted?",Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: Bush explains what he told the Prime Minister: the abuses are “disgusting,” require “accountability,” Abu Ghraib perpetrators were “brought to justice,” and he assured him similar incidents “will be dealt with” and “there will be justice,” though he can’t guarantee no violations will occur. This directly addresses how he tried to convince him (by pointing to past prosecutions and promising accountability/justice going forward).
LABEL: Clear Reply"
58,"Mr. Prime Minister, are you today convinced that violations of human rights will stop so that these violations are not undermining the war for democracy in Iraq?",Clear Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The Prime Minister addresses whether he is convinced by saying he “can give no guarantee,” but asserts that in free societies the process will be transparent and wrongdoers will be prosecuted. This speaks to accountability rather than directly confirming that violations will stop, so it only partially answers the question.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
59,"What about written questions, do you think that would have",Clear Reply,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The question asks for an assessment of using written questions, but the president explicitly says “I don’t know” and indicates he hasn’t tried it, offering only speculative thoughts without a definitive answer.
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
60,"What about this basic question of settlements, sir, that's been so touchy between the two countries?",Clear Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for the President’s position on the settlements issue. He responds only in broad, indirect terms by praising Rabin’s “different approach” and saying it satisfies the U.S., without stating a clear policy, specific stance, or concrete details about settlements.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
61,"To clear up the situation in Louisiana, Mr. President, is it your expectation that no Federal troops will be necessary there?",Clear Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for the President’s expectation about whether federal troops will be necessary. He answers indirectly—saying he “gather[s] that’s the case right now,” but qualifies it with uncertainty and contingency (“if more was required, please let us know”) and notes he hasn’t spoken to the governor himself. This provides a tentative, non-committal expectation rather than a clear yes/no.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
62,Are there inherent and unavoidable risks in allowing the sale of a defense firm to interests owned by Dubai?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether there are “inherent and unavoidable risks.” The answer does not address risk directly; instead it references that the deal was reviewed and approved and that he’s convinced it should proceed, implying confidence but not stating whether risks are inherent/unavoidable.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
63,"I got a few more, if you like.",Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The interviewer is asking for permission to continue with more questions. The President responds with a joking remark about the interviewer’s day, but does not explicitly say yes or no or otherwise indicate permission to proceed.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
64,How close are you to an agreement on a package of incentives for Iran?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: Bush talks generally about diplomatic strategy, UN options, and conditions (Iran must suspend enrichment to get an “enhanced package”), but he never states how close they are to reaching an incentives agreement (no timeline, status, or concrete indication of proximity).
LABEL: Ambivalent"
65,What does Iran stand to gain if it were to give up its enrichment program?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks what specific incentives Iran would gain by giving up enrichment. Bush does not state any concrete benefits; he only says Iran must suspend first and mentions an “enhanced package” without detailing what it includes. This is vague and indirect rather than a direct list of gains.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
66,Why are you ignoring these recent back-channel overtures from Iran?,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: Bush does not directly explain why the U.S. is “ignoring” back-channel overtures. He shifts to broader points about coalition strategy, the UN Security Council, and Iran needing to suspend enrichment, then trails off (“you said back channels—”) without providing a reason addressing the back-channel question.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
67,"Over the course of this investigation, have you learned anything that you didn't know before about what was going on in your administration?",Clear Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether he learned anything new about what was going on in his administration. He does not state whether he learned new information; instead he points to the prosecutor’s decision and deflects to the ongoing trial and that he won’t comment further.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
68,Do you have any work to do to rebuild credibility that might have been lost?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether he needs to rebuild credibility. He does not address credibility or any steps to rebuild it; instead he cites the prosecutor’s decision and deflects to the ongoing trial and moving forward.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
69,Have you anything more on the war debts?,Clear Reply,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether the President has any additional information on war debts. He explicitly answers “No,” directly indicating he has nothing more to add.  
LABEL: Clear Reply"
70,Did you feel that reporters had been fair to you in their questions?,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The President does not state whether he felt reporters were fair; he deflects by minimizing reporters’ ability to affect him, implying but not explicitly answering the fairness question.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
71,What are the prerequisites or conditions for resumption of some sort of trade with Red China?,Clear Non-Reply,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks for conditions to resume trade. The president states they won’t trade given China’s current policy, and specifies a condition: if Red China indicates a desire to live at peace with the U.S. and neighboring countries, the U.S. would reappraise its policies (implying trade could be reconsidered). This provides a concrete prerequisite, even if not detailed.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
72,"Are you going to do it now, sir?",Clear Non-Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for a direct yes/no about doing something “now.” The President does not answer that timing question; instead he talks generally about conditions needing to be met and willingness to talk when “they” come forward, without stating whether he will do it now.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
73,Do you think you should be discussing it with him?,Clear Reply,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether he should be discussing it with him. The President answers directly “No,” explains why it would be improper, and describes an alternative channel (through attorneys), which directly addresses the question.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
74,"Do you think the press conference should be regular—like you hold it—once a week, or twice a week?",Clear Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for a specific frequency (once or twice a week). The President only says press conferences should occur “with regularity” and gives general reasons, without choosing a weekly schedule or any concrete cadence.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
75,Do you both accept that the Iraqi Government is a substantial vindication of the conflict?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether he accepts that the Iraqi Government vindicates the conflict. He does not explicitly say “yes” or “no,” but he repeatedly points to the unity government, elections, and constitutional process as “progress” and contrasts it with Saddam’s rule, implying vindication without stating it directly.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
76,"Do you also accept that the Iraq conflict has left both of you politically weakened and, whether justly or unjustly, less able to give the kind of moral leadership that you're discussing today?",Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for acceptance that the Iraq conflict politically weakened them and reduced their moral leadership capacity. Bush does not directly accept or deny being politically weakened or less able to lead morally; he shifts to public consternation, progress in Iraq, and the strategy for victory. Any implied acknowledgment is indirect and incomplete.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
77,What idea from a critic or somebody outside your administration have you concluded should be part of the strategy going forward in Iraq?,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for a specific idea from an outside critic that the President has decided to incorporate into the Iraq strategy. The answer lists outside criticisms/advice (troop levels, more indirect role, better equipping Iraqi forces, reconstruction changes) and gives one concrete example of adoption: agreeing that Iraqi forces need more mobility and shifting aid toward a PRT approach. However, he never clearly states “I have concluded X will be part of the strategy” in a single explicit, definitive way; it’s presented as discussion/partial incorporation rather than a direct identification of one adopted idea.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
78,Can you confirm if it's true that tomorrow you will meet in Lisbon with Prime Minister from Israel Ehud Barak?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: Clinton explicitly confirms the meeting (“Yes. I will”) and adds timing/context, directly answering the confirmation request.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
79,Would you sum up for us your idea of what kind of a United States you would like your grandchildren to live in?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for a summary vision of the kind of United States he wants his grandchildren to live in. The President gives a direct, if broad, description: a peaceful world, citizens enjoying privileges and responsibilities, and continual raising of spiritual, intellectual, and economic standards. It answers the prompt but in general terms.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
80,Does the closeness of today's abortion vote in the Supreme Court suggest that abortion rights are at risk in the next court?,Clear Reply,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The President directly addresses whether abortion rights are at risk by saying the Roe rule was “narrowly upheld,” that this reflects the current vote count for Roe, and that with 2–4 upcoming Supreme Court appointments the rule could be “maintained or overturned,” meaning rights are “very much in the balance.” This explicitly indicates risk in the next court depending on appointments.  
LABEL: Clear Reply"
81,"Or, does the fact that partial birth abortion can survive even a conservative court suggest that they aren't as threatened as some believe?",Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether the decision shows abortion rights “aren’t as threatened as some believe.” The President doesn’t directly answer that framing; instead he says the ruling reflects adherence to Roe, notes it was narrowly upheld, and emphasizes future Supreme Court appointments could maintain or overturn Roe—implying rights are “in the balance.” This is an indirect/partial response rather than a clear yes/no to “aren’t as threatened.”
LABEL: Ambivalent"
82,It sounds like you are willing to give an endorsement.,Ambivalent,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The “answer” contains only a reference to a reporter (“Ron Allen, NBC”), audience reaction (“[Laughter]”), and a topic label (“2016 Presidential Election”), with no substantive statement about whether he is willing to give an endorsement. It provides none of the requested information.
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
83,Would you go along with border protection only and a guest-worker program?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether he would accept a plan limited to border protection and a guest-worker program. He does not give a direct yes/no; instead he insists on a “comprehensive bill” and discusses broader principles (border security plus an earned path to citizenship, anti-amnesty). This implies he would not go along with “only” those elements, but he never states it explicitly.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
84,"Mr. President, could you tell us anything further about your plans when you leave office, in a personal vein?",Clear Non-Reply,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: He explicitly says he cannot provide a definite program because he has no definite plans, offering only to talk about Inauguration Day instead of post-office plans. This amounts to not providing the requested information.  
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
85,Could you elaborate on your feelings about your relations with the press?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: He addresses the question by describing his general relationship with the press: personally friendly, comfortable with “penetrating and searching” questions, but dislikes “loaded” questions. This conveys his feelings, though in broad terms rather than detailed specifics.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
86,Could you elaborate on your feelings about these press conferences in particular?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: He gives some relevant feelings (generally friendly on a personal basis; accepts “penetrating and searching questions”; objects only to unfair “beating your wife” type questions) but begins by saying he can’t elaborate much and doesn’t specifically elaborate in detail about the press conferences themselves beyond generalities.

LABEL: Ambivalent"
92,What have you learned over these 8 years that may have changed your view of the Soviet system?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The response only references that journalists have quoted his first press conference and identifies who asked the earlier question.

93,"Are you flying back to Houston without us, sir?",Clear Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for a yes/no (or clear) statement about whether he is flying back to Houston without them.

LABEL: Ambivalent"
94,How do you see the holdouts?,Clear Non-Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for Obama’s view of the “holdouts.” He explicitly declines to comment on the substance because it’s a pending legal matter, then offers only broad, indirect remarks about Macri’s “constructive approach” and the general benefits of a resolution. This provides no specific view of the holdouts themselves.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
95,"So your Italian accent, of course.",Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question is a prompt about the speaker’s Italian accent, but the answer is a joking aside (“grazie”) with no substantive comment or information about the accent. It neither explains nor addresses it directly.

96,"Would it be better for the Attorney General, for your administration, and for the Vice President's candidacy if he invited such an investigation?",Clear Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether it would be better if the Vice President invited an investigation. The President does not give a direct yes/no assessment; instead he defers to the Attorney General’s judgment, notes internal disagreement at DOJ, praises release of the transcript, and says the public can judge. This is a dodge/deflection rather than a concrete answer to “would it be better.”
LABEL: Ambivalent"
97,Will you talk about Haiti after this week?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether he will talk about Haiti. The response is a sarcastic deflection about reporters not asking questions, and it does not state yes/no or provide any information about discussing Haiti.

99,Does the Federal Government have the lead role in this right now?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether the Federal Government has the lead role “right now.” The answer directly distinguishes domains: it has a leading role in humanitarian relief but not in security (state/National Guard lead). This is a direct, specific response with a qualified “yes in one area, no in another.”
LABEL: Clear Reply"
100,How can the United States help Lebanon cope with the massive number of Syrian refugees?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for specific ways the U.S. can help Lebanon handle Syrian refugees and possibly facilitate returns.

LABEL: Ambivalent"
105,Can you tell us roughly how many dependents will be pulled back?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks for a rough number of dependents to be pulled back.

LABEL: Clear Reply"
106,"What are your feelings about discussions, in the new Iraqi Government, of amnesty for insurgents?",Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for his feelings about amnesty for insurgents, but he does not address amnesty at all.

109,Do you expect that Mr. Nixon will be accused of creating a credibility gap?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether Nixon will be accused of creating a “credibility gap.” The President doesn’t give a direct yes/no, but suggests such accusations may arise indirectly (“differences in opinion… from time to time”) while saying they likely won’t use the same words. This is an implicit, non-specific answer rather than a clear prediction.

114,Why do you feel James Comey’s testimony vindicated you when it boils down to his word against your word?,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: He asserts generally that Comey’s testimony showed “no collusion, no obstruction” and that Comey “confirmed a lot of what I said,” but he does not directly explain *why* that amounts to vindication despite it being “his word against your word,” nor does he provide specific supporting details; he also shifts to other topics.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
115,Do tapes exist of your conversations with James Comey?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks directly whether tapes exist. Trump does not answer yes or no; he says he might talk about it “sometime in the very near future” and pivots to “no collusion, no obstruction” and other topics. This withholds the requested information rather than explicitly declining.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
116,I wanted to know if it was going to be transferred to the Navy?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether it was going to be transferred to the Navy; the President answers “Yes,” explicitly confirming the transfer.

119,"With hurricane season only a month away, can you assure the American people that your Government has learned the lessons of Katrina?",Clear Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: He responds to the assurance request by stating “the lessons are being learned” and gives several concrete “lessons”/measures (coordination, communications, law enforcement backup, pre-positioning assets, evacuation/relief planning, levee funding). However, he stops short of an explicit, direct assurance (“Yes, I can assure…”) and shifts into broader discussion (levees), making the assurance implicit rather than clearly stated.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
120,Possible amnesty for insurgents.,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether there will be amnesty for insurgents. The answer shifts to “reconciliation,” discusses general attitudes about balancing Ba’ath Party membership versus terrorism, and explicitly says he’s “not exactly sure” what is meant and doesn’t know how lenient they’ll be. It does not clearly state any amnesty policy for insurgents.

LABEL: Ambivalent"
125,"Can you tell us, sir, what you think is the greatest problem confronting your successor?",Clear Reply,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks for the single greatest problem facing the successor. The president identifies it as dealing with the “intransigent, unreasonable attitude of the Communist bloc” and the challenge of staying “strong and firm and yet conciliatory” in response. This directly states the problem, albeit with some elaboration.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
126,Do you think the debates have helped keep up the level of the campaign?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether the debates helped “keep up the level of the campaign.” The President instead gives a general positive evaluation of the debates as “wholesome” and “constructive” and discusses initiating them and wanting them institutionalized, without directly addressing their effect on the campaign’s level.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
127,"Is the course of it by national arrangements rather than multinational, do you think?",Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether the approach should be national rather than multinational. The answer talks generally about summit agreement, unity, and forming a team, with examples like tracking money, but never clearly states a position on national vs. multinational arrangements; it’s mostly deflection and vague.

The answer largely refuses to discuss options (“many things I can't comment,” “I can't speculate or even hint at what might be options”), and only offers general statements about maintaining economic measures and wanting Panama to return to civilian democracy, without directly answering whether he has given up on forceful action across the countries mentioned.

175,Will the American taxpayer have to bail it out?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: He addresses the taxpayer bailout question only indirectly. He says he “certainly hope[s] not” and “don’t think so,” but gives no concrete commitment or policy detail on whether taxpayers will, in fact, have to bail it out; he also shifts to general market conditions and says only that there’s “a problem.”
LABEL: Ambivalent"
176,What do you think of Trump's approach to Putin?,Ambivalent,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The question asks for Obama’s opinion on Trump’s approach to Putin. Obama’s response (“I can still hear.”) does not provide any evaluation, description, or relevant information about Trump or Putin; it only comments on his ability to hear, effectively not answering the question.
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
177,How would it affect America's interest on the international stage?,Ambivalent,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The question asks how Trump’s approach to Putin would affect America’s interests internationally, but Obama’s response (“I can still hear.”) provides no substantive information and does not address the topic at all.
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"

LABEL: Clear Reply"
181,Are you going to write your memoirs?,Ambivalent,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The question asks for a definite intention (“are you going to write your memoirs?”). The President explicitly says he can’t answer and doesn’t know, offering no commitment either way.
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
182,Are you going to run for Senator from Missouri?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for a definite yes/no about running. The speaker avoids a firm commitment (“I can’t say that I will”) and shifts to timing, leaving the decision unresolved.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
183,"Given everything you've been hearing from Mr. Ahmadi-nejad over the past several weeks and months, in your estimation, is this someone you can work with?",Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for the president’s personal assessment—yes/no or a direct judgment—about whether he can work with Ahmadinejad.

LABEL: Ambivalent"
184,Have you authority to do that now?,Clear Reply,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether he currently has the authority. He directly cites the law as giving the President authority to issue executive orders now and explains the congressional review timeline, indicating he does have authority at present.

LABEL: Clear Reply"
187,Were you in contact with Governor Chiles as soon as that plan was developed to be sure that he understood it?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: He directly confirms contact (“we did talk about that, yes”) and implies it occurred by Tuesday in Florida, addressing whether he was in contact to ensure the Governor understood the plan. While not tightly specifying “as soon as the plan was developed,” he does provide a direct affirmative that they discussed it in the relevant timeframe.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
188,"Could [Governor Chiles] right then, the second he asked for Federal assistance, be assured these troops would be in there?",Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether Governor Chiles could be assured that troops would be deployed immediately upon his request.

LABEL: Ambivalent"
189,"Is that something you want, sir?",Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question is a yes/no about whether he wants “that.” He explicitly answers “Yes,” directly addressing the question, even though he then elaborates broadly about peace and avoiding war.  
LABEL: Clear Reply"
190,What's the toughest thing that you've had in your job?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks for the toughest thing in the job.

LABEL: Clear Reply"
191,What's been the toughest part of these 8 years?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for the toughest part of the past 8 years. The response begins with “The President,” which could be interpreted as an answer, but it’s not clearly explained or developed, and the speaker immediately pivots to joking/complaining about follow-ups rather than specifying the toughest part in a concrete way.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
192,"Is there a disposition to forget about that, for the time being?",Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether there is a disposition to “forget about that” for now. The respondent directly answers “No. Oh, no,” which explicitly denies that disposition.  
LABEL: Clear Reply"
193,Do you think Governor Roosevelt's visit might come as early as Wednesday?,Ambivalent,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether the visit could be as early as Wednesday. The President explicitly says “I don’t know,” offering only vague second-hand timing (“latter part of the week”) and then pivots to an unrelated point, so he does not provide the requested judgment.
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
194,Were there any discussions about the Visa Waiver Program for Romania?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: Trump explicitly states twice, “We didn't discuss it,” directly answering whether there were discussions about the Visa Waiver Program for Romania.  
LABEL: Clear Reply"
195,Is there a timeframe for including Romania in this program?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The answer says the visa waiver program was not discussed and offers only a vague hope to “advance” on it, without giving any schedule or concrete timeframe for Romania’s inclusion.

LABEL: Ambivalent"
197,Did he not in his statement say that he accepts the U.N. articles and that he recognizes Israel?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for a clear confirmation of whether the statement included acceptance of U.N. articles and recognition of Israel. The answer does not explicitly say “yes” or “no,” and instead discusses ongoing analysis and how later remarks may qualify or nullify earlier ones, without confirming the specific content of the statement.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
198,What is the fine line that he hasn't crossed?,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for a specific “fine line” not yet crossed. The answer does not identify any concrete line or criterion; it only says they are still analyzing and that subsequent remarks may “reduce or nullify” earlier statements. This is a general, non-specific explanation rather than the requested detail.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
199,Do you think that FEMA is prepared for the season?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: He never directly answers “Is FEMA prepared?” with a clear yes/no or specific measurable preparedness status. Instead, he broadens to “preparation at all levels,” describes coordination efforts and planning (Chertoff’s visits, transportation plans), and ends with a general “we’re doing it” and “I feel pretty good,” which implies confidence but doesn’t explicitly state FEMA is prepared.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
200,Is there any way to measure FEMA’s preparedness at this point?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether there is a way to measure FEMA’s preparedness. The answer discusses general notions of preparedness, coordination, planning, and Chertoff reviewing plans, but it does not provide any concrete measurement method, metric, or criteria for assessing preparedness. It implies efforts are underway and he “feels pretty good,” which is evaluative but not a direct answer about measurability.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
201,Is there any hope by the end of the year that we might see some of the fliers released from North Vietnam?,Ambivalent,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether there is hope for releases by year’s end.

202,"So if the Justice Department was informing Billy at the same time that you were learning of this from the Justice Department, you're saying, in effect, that there was no need, even, for anyone in the White House to let Billy know that he should come in and voluntarily admit that he was an agent?",Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether, given DOJ was informing Billy, there was therefore no need for anyone in the White House to tell Billy to come in and voluntarily admit he was an agent. The President does not directly affirm or deny that “there was no need”; instead he shifts to saying the White House never gave Billy any information and that DOJ was telling him the same thing they were telling Billy’s lawyers. This implies an answer but does not explicitly provide it in the requested form.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
203,That's three. That's three.,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The prompt “That’s three. That’s three.” appears to be a remark about a count or tally, but the answer shifts to unrelated procedural/press-conference commentary (“The President… called on… Cooper… Emergency Response Preparation”) and does not explicitly address what “three” refers to or confirm/deny the count.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
204,"And if she asks for it, will we grant her permanent residence?",Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks specifically whether permanent residence would be granted. The answer instead says she would be permitted to return to the U.S., which does not explicitly address permanent residence status and dodges the specific request.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
205,Have you come to a firm decision on the value of the third-term amendment—no third-term amendment?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether he has reached a firm decision. He answers by stating his view “on balance” that the two-term amendment is “probably a pretty good thing,” indicating a decided position in favor of such an amendment, with some hedging (“probably”) but still giving his conclusion.  
LABEL: Clear Reply"
206,Do you have any idea that might usefully be put forward for the use of ex-Presidents of the United States?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for a specific idea for what ex-Presidents could usefully do. The President avoids offering a concrete proposal, saying it’s up to the people and only vaguely suggesting he might return to the Press Gallery to “learn something” and perhaps do something “constructive.” This is general and speculative rather than a direct, actionable idea.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
207,Now that doesn't apply to any other commercial products that might be in the submerged lands?,Clear Reply,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether the policy applies to other commercial products in submerged lands.

LABEL: Clear Reply"
208,Where do you see a breakthrough in this dispute?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks where a breakthrough might occur in the Qatar dispute. Trump does not identify any specific avenue, condition, or negotiation point for a breakthrough; he shifts to a general claim about terrorism funding and says he wants it stopped, implying a condition but not stating where the breakthrough would be.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
209,Do you see any indications to make us believe that this crisis will come to an end?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: Trump does not cite concrete indications (e.g., developments, commitments, timelines) that the crisis will end.

LABEL: Clear Reply"
212,Are you planning to visit the drought area yourself and take a firsthand look yourself?,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for a clear plan/intent to visit. The answer does not commit to yes or no, instead conditionally defers the decision to what a task force determines, leaving the plan unresolved.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
213,When will you tell us about the recordings?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for a specific time frame. The answer gives only a vague, non-specific timeframe (“over a fairly short period of time”) without concrete details (date, deadline, or clear schedule), so it’s incomplete.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
214,"Well, let me just ask the question.",Ambivalent,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The interviewer hasn’t actually asked a substantive question—only a preface. The president’s “Okay” merely signals readiness and provides no information in response to any request.
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
215,Was Chiles slow to ask for Federal troops?,Ambivalent,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The question asks for an evaluation of whether Chiles was slow to request federal troops. The President explicitly refuses to make that judgment (“I’m not going to say that”) and instead shifts to describing cooperation and the federal response.
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
216,Do you have any reason to believe that the American hostages who are still being held in the Middle East will be released after you leave office?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether he has any reason to believe the hostages will be released after he leaves office. The answer does not state yes or no or provide a concrete reason; it shifts to general policy about not paying ransom, exploring channels, and hoping for negotiations with Iran, without addressing the timing (“after you leave office”) directly.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
217,Would you go along with an effort by some Senate Republicans that could levy a significant tax on oil companies' profits?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether he would support a specific policy (a significant tax on oil companies’ profits). The answer does not state support or opposition; it shifts to what oil companies “should” do (reinvest, expand capacity, renewables) and mentions FTC monitoring, without addressing the proposed tax.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
218,Does it bother you that the oil companies are racking up these record profits when people are paying $3 a gallon?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for an explicit stance/feeling (“does it bother you”). The answer avoids stating whether he is bothered, instead giving general expectations for oil company reinvestment and mentioning FTC monitoring. Any implied concern is indirect and not a direct yes/no or clear expression of bother.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
219,Would you veto an immigration bill that did not include a guest-worker program?,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: He explains his broader immigration framework and argues strongly in favor of a guest-worker program, but he never explicitly answers whether he would veto a bill lacking it (no clear “yes” or “no,” no conditional veto statement).  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
220,How do you counter the angry argument from conservatives on Capitol Hill who are saying that your demand for one could hurt the Republican Party this fall?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks how he counters conservatives’ argument that demanding a guest-worker program could hurt Republicans electorally. In his response, he largely pivots to broad principles of immigration policy (dignity, enforcing laws, border security, employer accountability) and explains why he supports a guest-worker program, but he does not directly address the electoral/party-impact criticism or give a concrete counterargument to that “hurts the GOP this fall” claim.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
221,It looks as though if they can't pay us we'll have to give them more time.,Clear Reply,Clear Non-Reply,"REASONING: The question asserts a likely policy outcome (“we’ll have to give them more time” if they can’t pay). The President responds with uncertainty (“I am not sure of that either”) and does not confirm, deny, or provide any concrete stance or details.
LABEL: Clear Non-Reply"
222,Do you trust Gorbachev?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for a direct yes/no on whether he trusts Gorbachev. The answer implies conditional trust (“He hasn't shown me any reason yet that I shouldn't”) but immediately qualifies it with “trust but verify,” avoiding an unequivocal statement of trust.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
223,Does an apology rule out the question of honor?,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether an apology would remove/negate the “question of honor.” The President answers “Yes” but then shifts to saying the U.S. will not apologize and discusses forums for Iranian grievances and ongoing negotiations, without clearly explaining the relationship between apology and honor in the abstract. The “Yes” is ambiguous because it’s not clarified whether he means “yes, it rules it out” or “yes, honor rules out an apology,” and the rest is largely deflection.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
224,Isn't the greater likelihood that this is a very widespread scandal?,Clear Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks whether the President agrees it is more likely a widespread scandal. He does not directly say “yes” or “no” or assess likelihood; instead he emphasizes he’s not minimizing it, notes due process, and shifts to praising the Defense Department for uncovering it. This is a deflection without answering the likelihood/widespreadness claim.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
225,"Mr. President, on the question of the Japanese mandates that you say will be taken away from them, who will be the controlling government in those mandates, the United States?",Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether the United States will be the controlling government.

LABEL: Clear Reply"
226,"Have the negotiations for renewal of the exchange agreement with the Soviet Union, scheduled to begin next Tuesday, been postponed?",Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether the negotiations have been postponed.

LABEL: Clear Reply"
227,"Mr. President, as a result of your 8 years of press conferences, have you any recommendations for changes?",Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for recommendations for changes. The president initially says “no,” but then describes specific changes already made (seating, identifying the questioner and outlet) and calls them improvements, which functions as an indirect/partial answer rather than clear new recommendations.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
228,Might it not have happened if you had kept a tighter rein on what was going on and inquired more closely into what was happening in this and in other situations?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether the situation could have been prevented with tighter oversight. The President responds directly that he doesn’t see how he could have exercised tighter control without endangering people involved, implying the event likely would not have been avoided by “keeping a tighter rein.” He gives a concrete reason (risk of identification/execution).
LABEL: Clear Reply"
229,Does this situation make you reconsider the possibility of a Government shutdown next month?,Clear Reply,Clear Reply,"REASONING: He addresses the question by stating the situation “has nothing to do with it” and is “separate,” implying it does not make him reconsider a shutdown. Though he adds unrelated commentary, the core answer is explicit.
LABEL: Clear Reply"
230,"When can we expect results, sir?",Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for a timeframe for results. The response avoids giving any time estimate, instead saying they must “wait and see how the talks go” and then shifting to general comments about negotiations and hopes for peace. No concrete timing is provided.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
231,Do you feel this transition period should be shortened or changed in any way?,Ambivalent,Clear Reply,"REASONING: The question asks whether the transition period should be shortened or changed. The President clearly addresses this by proposing a concrete change—amending the Constitution to alter election/inauguration timing so a new President has about 80 days before meeting Congress—indicating it should be changed (not shortened).
LABEL: Clear Reply"
232,Are you satisfied from what you have learned out of your meeting with the President with regard to the Iranian issue?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for a satisfaction judgment from the Prime Minister about what he learned in the meeting. The provided response is from President Bush and discusses diplomatic strategy and options regarding Iran, but does not state whether the Prime Minister is satisfied with what he learned from their meeting.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
233,What's your message to the Israeli public about this issue?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for a direct message to the Israeli public. Bush’s response focuses on U.S. diplomatic strategy (shared goal, UN, EU-3, Russia/China) and only briefly implies reassurance (“important for Israel to know”) without delivering a clear, explicit message addressed to the Israeli public.
LABEL: Ambivalent"
234,"With your permission, is there a military option, from your point of view, to solve the threat of the Iranian problem, their work on—to getting nuclear weapons?",Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks explicitly whether a military option exists. Bush talks about prioritizing diplomacy, UN Security Council, and working with allies, but he does not directly state whether military force is an option (yes/no) or describe it. The closest is a vague reference to “a variety of options,” which is not a direct answer to the military-option question.  
LABEL: Ambivalent"
235,Do you feel that the Attorney General should indeed stay? Should he resign? Do you intend on firing him? Why should he remain as the Attorney General?,Ambivalent,Ambivalent,"REASONING: He comments on wanting the Attorney General to be tougher on leaks and says he is “very disappointed,” but he does not clearly state whether the AG should stay, resign, or be fired—only “we will see what happens” and “time will tell.” The requested decision is left unresolved.

236,"With the health care vote that just came about, at what point do you feel that Republicans, if they can't get something done, should just say, you know what, we gave it a go, let's move on to tax reform instead?",Clear Reply,Ambivalent,"REASONING: The question asks for a specific threshold/condition for when Republicans should abandon health care and pivot to tax reform. Trump does not provide any point or criterion; instead he celebrates the vote, criticizes Obamacare, and says they’ll come up with a plan soon. That’s a deflection and lacks the requested concrete trigger.
