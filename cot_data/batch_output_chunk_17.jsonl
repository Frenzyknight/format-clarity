The question seeks a specific strategy: how the President can convince Turkey\u2019s President to end the occupation. In response, the speaker: (a) reframes the issue as a negotiation between Cypriots, supported by the international community; (b) stresses that it is an international problem, not a bilateral Greece\u2013Turkey issue; (c) outlines Greece\u2019s general stance (support for a fair, sustainable solution without permanent Turkish troops); and (d) explicitly states that convincing President Erdogan is \u201cnot my responsibility.\u201d This gives some relevant context about the process and actors involved, but it does not directly answer the \u201chow can you convince him\u201d part with concrete persuasive tools or actions. Because the topic is engaged but the core of the question is sidestepped and only indirectly addressed, the response is incomplete rather than fully clear or fully absent\u2014hence it is best classified as Ambivalent.\"}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1502, "completion_tokens": 608, "total_tokens": 2110, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

In his reply, the President explicitly attributes this to Europe\u2019s more complex and constrained political and institutional environment compared to his own. He notes that he had a simpler task because he had his party controlling Congress in one country, whereas European leaders had to operate by consensus across multiple parliaments, commissions, unions, and countries that shared a currency but were in different economic situations.

These points are relevant to the broader theme of helping Europe and Greece, but they are not framed as concrete, time\u2011specific commitments for the last two months.
