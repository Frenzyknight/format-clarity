I'd be glad to.[The reporter continued in Turkish, and her question was translated by an interpreter as follows.]Mr. President, about FET\u00d6, we are not getting the best of news out of the United States. And the FET\u00d6 office targeting Turkey is extensively invested in their daily works, but I can see certain traces that the U.S. Government is ready to understand more about FET\u00d6.So my question is: How do you perceive the situation developing vis-a-vis the Fethullahist terrorist organization and the American approach to FET\u00d6 in that regard? Can we expect anything further?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes. Thank you. During this current visit, we are going to submit\u2014as we already have, actually\u2014a great deal of documents and evidence. And FET\u00d6 is a terrorist organization, and he is the leader, the ringleader of this terrorist organization. They have killed 251 people in Turkey. They tried to undertake a coup against the Government, the state. And more than 1,000\u2014more than 2,000 people have been injured. And the ringleader is living on an area of 400 acres in the United States, running his network all around the globe, and this is something unacceptable.And during this visit, as I've said before, we have introduced an additional array of documents. We will submit them to the relevant authorities, including Mr. President. And in the light of these documents, I think they will appreciate the situation. We send the terrorists back, if they ask for them, and I'm sure they will do the same for us.

And President Erdogan: President Trump sent you a letter on October the 9th, urging you not to launch a military action into northern Syria. He said, quote: Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool. You ignored that letter, and you went ahead, and you launched a military action into northern Syria. Can you explain why you ignored the President's warning?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, this letter was re-presented to Mr. President this afternoon. And I've also underlined the fact that a terrorist such as Ferhat Abdi Sahin should not be considered as an interlocutor by a country such as the United States. And this individual, Ferhat Abdi Sahin, has been instrumental in the killings of hundreds of Turkish civilians, and he is a person labeled as like a son for the terrorist leader who is currently incarcerated in Turkey, Abdullah \u00d6calan.So a person like this should not be welcomed by a country such as the United States. And similarly, this person was welcomed by a country such as Russia. So it's very difficult for me to understand these when we're trying to fight terrorism on a global scale. If we're going to sustain our fight against terrorism in a healthy fashion, we need to be much more sensitive than we currently are. It happens to us today, and it will happen to somebody else tomorrow is a saying that goes in our language.We have also provided information and the document thereof to our interlocutors in the White House, including Mr. President. And I have also submitted a document produced by CIA, pointing out to the fact that this individual is a terrorist, to Mr. President.And, as I've said before, I have shared them with His Excellency, Mr. President. And we gave back the letter that we have received.

Donatella Di Nitto of LaPresse. A question for President Mattarella: President Trump seems to being open on discussing the possible tariffs. So do you think it will be possible to avoid tariffs being imposed in 2 days' time?And a question for President Trump: Now, we all know your concerns concerning Huawei entering Italy's security system. Are you satisfied with the measures that Italy decided to implement?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I'll answer first. Yes, I am satisfied. They have been very accommodating. They weren't at the beginning, and they have been since then.And I want to just thank the Italian Government and your Prime Minister, actually, in addition to the President. But as you know, I had long conversations with my friend, and they were very nice. So I am very satisfied. And we just discussed the same conversation with the President. We're very satisfied. Thank you. As far as the topic of tariffs is concernedtariffs following the WTO decision on the EU's contribution, or the subsidies to the Airbus consortiumI already mentioned what our belief is. Let me repeat it:I think that within the transatlantic relationship, and with the friendship that there has always been between the U.S. and the EU, it would be preferable to discuss our respective positions so that we can find a solution which takes into account the requirements of both parties. And that's wholly possible.The alternative would be that of imposing tariffs. Currently, following the WTO's decision concerning Airbus, wethere may be tariffs. And there may be tariffs in 6 months' time concerning the subsidies given to Boeing. This is a mere race between tariffs and mutual tariffs. I think it would be best to meet and to deal with our mutual needs so that a solution can be found.But if we don't do this now, it will have to be done soon. And I believe it would be best to find a solution immediately, instead of imposing tariffs, which would lead to other tariffs, and that would be a damage to both our economies. Well, actually, the tariff situation is interesting because we justit's like I said with China, and it turned out to be truewe cannot lose a war of tariffs because the imbalance is so great between the United States and, in this case, the European Union. Also true with China. That turned out to be right. We've collected tens of billions of dollars of tariffs. We've given some to the farmers, to make them even. And now the farmers are going to have a bigger contract than they ever thought possible. They won't be able to produce even that much, but I think they will, because they're incredible, ingenious. As I say, jokingly, but probably not jokingly: They'll just have to buy larger tractors, which is probably what they're doing right now. But the farmers come out so well.But in a war of tariffs with the European Union, the trade imbalance is so great that we can't lose that, because they do much more business than we do, and that's unfortunate. But the word reciprocity is probably my favorite word. Of all of these words, all of the semicomplicated, complicatedto me, not complicated at allthings that we're doing, it's got to be reciprocal, and it's not.The European Union has taken tremendous advantage of the United States. Many of us come throughone way or the otherthrough the European Union. That's the good news. The bad news is they've been very smart. They've been very smart. Jean-Claude has been brilliant. Now he's leaving, but he's beenhe's been brilliant at really helping them and not helping us.And so that's changing now. But we can't lose that particular war of tariffs, because the trade imbalance is tremendous. It's tremendous. And if you look at what they don't havethe barriers that they put up; they put up tremendous barriers to our doing business in Europetremendous barriersboth from a monetary standpoint and what they call nonmonetary barriers.It's a very tough thing. Our farm products, very hard to get them in. Our cars, very hard to get them in. And yet they send Mercedes. They send BMW. Then they send Volkswagen; Renault, in the case of France. So it's a very tough situation for us for many years, but now it's a very tough situation for them. Because I can remedy the situation very easily, and there really is not any financial counterattack. Hopefully, I don't have to do that.We arewith all of the being said, we are talking. We're talking with some new people in Europe, and I hope it's going to be successful; that way, we don't have to talk about it or worry about it, because our relationship should be a great one. But we have to be treated fairly on NATO, and we have to be treated fairly on trade with the European Union.Thank you all very much.

Mr. President, thank you. President Niinist\u00f6. If I could, sir, I've got two pertinent questions to ask you. Maybe I could ask them separately to get a fresh answer out of each one.The three House Intelligence\u2014the three House committees that are looking into the impeachment inquiry gave notice today that they will be sending a subpoena to the White House for documents and other materials. Will you cooperate with those subpoenas?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I always cooperate. This is a hoax. This is the greatest hoax. This is just a continuation of what's been playing out, John, for the last\u2014since my election, I would say. If you wanted\u2014probably, we'll find out soon, but probably even before my election.This is a fraudulent crime on the American people. But we'll work together with Shifty Schiff and Pelosi and all of them, and we'll see what happens, because we did absolutely\u2014I had a great call with the President of Ukraine. It was a hundred percent. You have the transcript. And then, Schiff went up, and he got\u2014as the chairman of the committee, he got up and related a call that didn't take place. He made up the language. I\u2014hard to believe. Nobody has ever seen this. I think he had some kind of a mental breakdown.But he went up to the microphone, and he read a statement from the President of the United States as if I were on the call, because what happened is, when he looked at the sheet\u2014which was an exact transcript of my call, done by very talented people that do this\u2014exact, word for word\u2014he said, Wow, he didn't do anything wrong. So he made it up. He went up to a microphone, and, in front of the American people and in Congress, he went out, and he gave a whole presentation of words that the President of the United States never said. It has to be a criminal act. It has to be. And he should resign. And some people even say it was treason. But it was a very sad thing.And just so you know, the call was perfect, the real call; the call I made. Many people were on the line. I knew that because, usually, when I speak to foreign country leaders\u2014you can name any one of them\u2014but when I speak on the phone, I know that we have many people listening from various intelligence agencies. My knowledge\u2014I know all about it. And so this isn't something like: Oh, gee, I'm on the line. Let's talk about a big secret. This is many people on the line. I don't even know how many. We'll find out, I guess. But many people. Mike Pompeo was on the line. He didn't say anything. He just\u2014because they listen for both knowledge and for security reasons and for lots of reasons.But the President of Ukraine, at the United Nations the other day\u2014and previous to that\u2014he announced through his spokesperson\u2014said there was absolutely no pressure put on him. There was no quid pro quo, at all. And if you look at this whistleblower's\u2014which I have a lot of respect for whistleblowers, but only when they're real\u2014his report of the phone call was totally different than the fact.But what got them was they never thought I was going to release the call. Because I don't like doing that. I don't want to do it. I hope I don't have to do it again: release phone calls to foreign dignitaries, to foreign leaders. I don't want to do that, John. I don't want to do it again. But I did it with the permission of the Ukrainian Government. We got permission. We called up their representatives and asked them, Would it be okay? Otherwise, I couldn't have done it.And if I wouldn't have done it, I would have been exposed to a lie, because the whistleblower report\u2014didn't he say, seven or eight times, I said quid pro quo? In other words, You're going to do this or you're not going to get money.Now, in all fairness\u2014Biden said it, and he's on tape. In all fairness, you have at least four United States Senators\u2014Democrats\u2014that said it. And they said it a lot stronger than even Schiff and his made-up story said it.Obama, when he was dealing with the President of Russia\u2014not Putin\u2014he said, Hey, tell Vladimir I can do a lot more after the election. You remember that? You didn't make a big deal out of that. Everybody thought: Oh, isn't that cute? Isn't that cute? My talk and my response\u2014Lindsey Graham said, I never knew you were that nice.

As I'm walking up here, they handed it to me. And I said to Mike\u2014I said: Whoa, that's something. That's big stuff. That's a big story. He knew long before, and he helped write it too. It's a scam. It's a scam.Just to finish on this\u2014I appreciate it. I love that second question, by the way. Should have asked it first. [] But let me just tell you: The whole thing is a scam. The Mueller deal was a scam. The Russian collusion was a scam. You can ask Putin.

President Niinist\u00f6, good to see you again. You had a conversation with President Trump about 5G and how Nokia, Finland's big company, could fill in that space. You also met with Chinese President Xi during the summer, in which you renewed the ties of friendship between the two nations. Do you believe that countries, particularly western countries, that put Huawei equipment in their 5G cores are at risk of national security?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThank you. Like I told already: In Europe, the situation is maybe a bit different from that here, because the main company you mentioned is inside Europe, partly, at least.What European Union is now doing is making a risk assessment, asking each country what kind of experience, what kind of\u2014what you have seen and found out. And that will be, well, finished in week two\u2014or 2 weeks' time. And after that, we have to decide together, in European Union, which kind of tools we need to protect ourselves.You referred to my discussions with the President Xi. We didn't talk about 5G while meeting. And we all know Nokia is a major factor in this area. They will answer for themselves. Thank you. You please. Pick somebody who is really nice from Finland. No more Finnish\u2014\u2014 Do you have a really nice person? Finnish\u2014\u2013 I think they're all nice in Finland. Are there Finnish reporters? Just two. Okay.

Thank you, Mr. President. You suggested that you didn't do anything wrong in the course of your conversations with the Ukrainian President. But can you explain to the American people why it is appropriate for an American President to ask a foreign leader for information about a political rival and what you would have said if you discovered that Barack Obama perhaps had asked a foreign leader for information about you before your campaign for the Presidency?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes. Well, that's what he did, isn't it, really? When you think about it.Look, that whole witch hunt was started, and hopefully, that'll all come out. But there's been some fantastic books written that just came out\u2014whether you will look at Gregg Jarrett, or McCarthy's book that just came out recently, and so many other books. I mean, a lot of books are coming out. When you start reading those books, you see what they did to us. What they've done to this country is a disgrace. They've hurt this country very badly. And no other President should have to go through what I've gone through.The President\u2014the new President of Ukraine is looking to stop corruption. There's a lot of corruption going on, and there was corruption. I just told you about Senators that threatened him with votes and no money coming into Ukraine if they do things. That's really what people are trying to say that I did, but the only difference is, I didn't do it. You take a look at that call; it was perfect. I didn't do it. There was no quid pro quo, but there was with Biden, and there was with these Senators. And they threatened. They said: You do this, you do that. We're not going to give you votes. That's\u2014that's the real deal. So we have an honest group of people that have been maligned. And you know, it's\u2014a lot of people say I'll do even better. I'm very happy. Yesterday, I guess, we had a 53 poll, and a lot of people say add 10 points to anything. Anybody voting for Trump, you can add\u2014anytime you get a poll, you can add 10 points or 7 points or 6 points. Take it any way you want. But I don't know if I consider that to be a compliment, but in one way, it is a compliment.And I guess that's what happened in the last election: Far more people came to vote than anybody thought possible.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhy is it appropriate for an American President to ask a foreign leader for information about a political rival?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

So why should the American people then be comfortable with an American President asking a foreign leader for information about an American citizen?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I think you can look at your Senators and you can look at Biden, and you can look at all these other people. But what we're looking for is corruption. An investigation started, called the Russian witch hunt, affectionately. And it was a total phony scam. It was set up by people within the Government to try and stop somebody from getting elected.And after that person\u2014namely, me\u2014won, and convincingly won at 306 to 223 in the electoral college\u2014which, by the way, when you run a race, if you're running electoral\u2014you know, if you go by the college, electoral college, that's a much different race than running popular vote. And it's like the hundred-yard dash or the mile. You train differently.And I can't help it that my opponent didn't go to Wisconsin and should have gone much more to Michigan and Pennsylvania and other places. But that's the way it is. We won an election convincingly. Convincingly. And then, you had the text message on, Well, if she doesn't win, we've got an insurance policy. How bad was that? You know the insurance policy? That's sort of what has been taking place over the last number of years, the insurance policy.No, there are a lot of very dishonest people. We're the ones that played it straight. And you know what? The millions of people out there that are looking at what's going on, those people understand it. They see it. And they think it's disgusting. And our people are being hurt, and our country is being hurt.When a Nancy Pelosi allows her position to be taken over by radical far-left Socialists, or worse, that's pretty bad. That's pretty bad, especially when the Senators and all of these other people have actually done what they're accusing me of doing, which I didn't do.I'm going to have Mike Pompeo say a couple of words. I'm going to have Steve Mnuchin say a couple of words. And then, we'll do a couple of more questions. Mr. President, I thought I'd start by talking about Iran. We had a productive week. We saw the Europeans take a position with respect to the attacks that took place in Saudi Arabia, making clear this was Iran, just as President Trump and I had been saying, and have now joined us in saying that the existing JCPOA framework is just not going to work. It's not going to solve the world's problems, it's not going to create Middle East stability.Then, we had a good set of meetings with our Middle East allies as well. The President joined for a meeting of the GCC where we talked again about how we can help deter. We want peace. We want a peaceful resolution with the Islamic Republic of Iran. We're hoping we can get that way. In the end, it will be up to the Iranians to make that decision, whether they'll choose violence and hate and\u2014as the President said in his speech yesterday to the General Assembly\u2014if their bloodthirst will continue.We hope that's the\u2014[inaudible]. We hope we can get the opportunity to negotiate with them and get an outcome that's good for both of them, for the United States, to make sure that they never have a nuclear weapon and that they can't foment their terror with ballistic missiles and in the way they have all around the world. And I think we made real progress uniting the world on that here over these past few days. Thank you. The President. Thank you, Mike. As Secretary Pompeo said, on Iran, we had very good discussions with all of our allies about the sanctions program, which is the maximum pressure, and unity on the sanctions program. The Europeans made it very clear they would not do anything without our consent.And then, on the economic front, we had the entire economic team here for all the meetings: Secretary Ross, Larry Kudlow; Ambassador Lighthizer just left to go back to DC. He's working hard on trying to get USMCA passed. But we had a lot of productive discussions. The Japanese trade deal and a lot of discussions on investing in the U.S., more jobs in the U.S., and more trade.

Well, I don't want to answer that question, but you know how I feel about NAFTA. I think NAFTA is the worst trade deal ever made, although I also happen to think World Trade Organization was not one of the greats. Not one of the greats. That was the creation of China, which went like a rocket ship from the day they signed. It was\u2014it was terrible.But no, we're going to find out. That's going to be a very interesting question, with Nancy and Chuck and all of these people focusing on the witch hunt because they can't beat us at the ballot. They can't beat us at the ballot. And they're not going to win the President. We're having great polls. We have internal polls that are\u2014Ohio, Iowa. Pennsylvania is looking good. North Carolina.We just won two races that a lot of people\u2014we thought we were going to lose both of those races. One was down 17 points 3 weeks before the race, and he ended up winning by a substantial margin\u2014by a substantial margin. And\u2014Dan Bishop. And then, we had a second race, as you know, and he was up one or two points and ended up winning by\u2014what was it? Twenty-five points or some incredible\u2014I'll ask you folks, because I don't want to be inaccurate. Otherwise, I'll have a front-page story: We have breaking news. Trump exaggerated.But he won by many, many points. And he was leading by maybe two, maybe three, but he won by\u2014in the twenties. So it's\u2014it's been\u2014so we're looking great in North Carolina, looking great in Florida.And you had one or two Congressmen, Democrats, say, Listen, we can't beat them at the election, so let's impeach him. Right? Didn't you hear\u2014Al Green. That's a beauty. He's a real beauty, that guy. But he said, very distinctively, it's all\u2014it was all over the place. I don't know\u2014they're trying to lose that tape, I guess. But he said, We can't . . . Essentially, he said: We can't beat him. Let's impeach him. That's pretty dangerous stuff.Steve [Steve A.

And are you now braced for long impeachment saga?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I thought we won. I thought it was dead. It was dead. The Mueller report\u2014no obstruction, no collusion. You look at all of the things that happened.Corey Lewandowski was fantastic the other day, as a person that they have been tormenting. You look at all the people that they've tormented, all the legal fees. People came here with bright eyes; they wanted to make life so great for other people. And they left where they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees that they didn't have. And it's a sad thing. What these Democrats have done to ruin lives is so sad.I've seen people with only good intention. They came to Washington because they wanted to make the United States and the world a better place. And they went home; they were dark. They got hit by Mueller's subpoenas. I think there were 2,500 subpoenas or some ridiculous number. Five hundred people were interviewed, and yet they don't interview Joe Biden and his son.If you're Democrat, you have automatic protection. That's years and years of people putting in certain people into positions. But when you look at all of the\u2014all of the trauma that these fakers, of course\u2014and the press\u2014look, the press is\u2014much of the press is not only fake, it's corrupt. These stories they write are corrupt; they're so wrong. And they know that.You know, it used to be\u2014I used to get great press until I ran for politics. I mean, I used to be the king of getting good press. I was very good at it. And I got good. I mean, they covered me well for what\u2014otherwise, I probably wouldn't be here. And once I ran, I said, Boy, this is incredible. But if you see the way they treat my family\u2014used to be treated great. My family worked so hard. The people that work with me\u2014these people\u2014all of these people, they work so hard. They've done such a good\u2014look, we have the greatest economy we've ever had. We have a military\u2014$2\u00bd trillion. We've rebuilt our military. You don't hear the vets complaining. We got choice approved. It couldn't be approved.But when you see what happened with the viciousness, and when you see little Adam Schiff go out and lie and lie and stand at the mike\u2014smart guy, by the way\u2014stand at the mike and act like he's so serious. And then, he goes into a room with Nadler, and they must laugh their asses off. They must laugh their asses off.But it's so bad for our country. People have said\u2014Rush Limbaugh\u2014great man; Sean Hannity said it. A lot of people have said it. Mark Levin. They said they don't know if one man anywhere in the world, with all the men they know\u2014or woman\u2014that could handle what I've had to handle. And I think that's true, but I handle it.

What do you need to see at this point to get that deal past the finish line?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWe're looking for a complete deal. I'm not looking for a partial deal. China has been starting to buy our agricultural product\u2014if you noticed over the last week\u2014and actually some very big purchases.But that's not what I'm looking for; we're looking for the big deal. We've taken it to this level. We're taking in billions and billions of dollars of tariffs. China has devalued their currency and they're putting out a lot of money into their economy. And they have a very bad economy right now and I don't want them to have a bad economy. But it's the worst in they say 57 years. Two weeks ago it was the worst in 22 years. Now it's 57 years and it's only going to get worse. Their supply chain is being broken up very badly.And companies are leaving because they can't pay the 25\u2014soon to go to 30\u2014percent tariff. And we have 30 percent very shortly on $250 billion. We have another tariff at a slightly smaller number as you know on other\u2014on about 300 billion dollars' worth of goods and products.So they would like to do something. As you know we're talking a little bit this week talking a lot next week. And then top people are going to be speaking the week following.

Do you feel you need that deal before the election, sir?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNo. I don't think I need it before the election. I think people know that we're doing a great job. I've rebuilt the military. We've\u2014Scott and I were talking about that. We spent 1\u00bd trillion dollars. When I came in our military was depleted. Frankly we didn't have ammunition okay? But our military was in very bad shape. We've rebuilt the military. We've got one of the strongest economies.Mike Pence actually got some\u2014who is right here. Our great Vice President. He was talking yesterday and he called me. He says Boy these numbers\u2014these consumer numbers are incredible. The retail numbers that came out 2 days ago that really weren't reported were really\u2014I mean just incredible numbers. You know that very well. That's your world. And some other numbers.We're doing very well. Our economy is very strong. And China is being affected very badly. We're not; we're not being affected. In fact we're taking in many billions of dollars. And China is eating that. You know China is eating the tariffs because of the devaluation. Now that doesn't happen with all countries. China is China and they know what they're doing as well as anybody.My relationship with President Xi is a very amazing one very good one. But we have right now a little spat. But I think we're doing very well.Our country is doing well. You look at so many different things. Look at all of the regulation cutting that allows us to do what we did. Look at what happens 3 days ago where you have an attack like that and it takes out a big chunk of oil and the prices go up $4 $5 and now it's heading down rapidly. That tells you\u2014that would have happened years ago it would have gone up $50. It would've doubled. And this was a blip.So it's been really amazing what we've been able to do. I think the voters understand that. I don't think it has any impact on the election.Now if something happened I think that would probably be a positive for the election but that's okay. I do think signing USMCA on a bipartisan basis with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and everybody else\u2014very bipartisan\u2014I think that's very important for our country. And I would certainly be willing to say that's a bipartisan deal.But I think that's very important for our manufacturers for our farmers. Even for unions they want that deal done. And so hopefully that's going to be put up to a vote very soon. There will be very little cajoling of the Democrats because most Democrats want it too.But the USMCA is ready to be voted on. It's finished. Mexico has taken their final votes. Canada is willing to do that any time we want them too. They're all set to go. And we need that for all of the\u2014we need that for our country. It's a great deal. It's a great deal.Thank you.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo you feel you need that deal before the election, sir?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, Mr. President, the best. [Laughter] Thank you very much for hosting us. Also on China and tariffs: What do you say to Australian businesses and to Australian people who say that your trade war with President Xi threatens their prosperity?And to the Prime Minister, a linked question: Do you think that Australians are going to be collateral damage in President Trump's tariff war with China?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell first of all you know I look at numbers. I love numbers. And the numbers of Australia are doing incredibly well. You're doing unbelievably well.When we have a deal with China\u2014or not\u2014but when we have a deal with China\u2014because they want to make it perhaps more than I want to make it. Because I actually love all the billions of dollars that's pouring into our Treasury. Billions and billions of dollars. We've never seen that before from China. It's always been the other way.But when\u2014and I'm taking care of our farmers out of that. We're helping our farmers. Our farmers were targeted and they were targeted for $16 billion. And I made that up to them. We paid them the $16 billion and had tens of billions of dollars left over.So I will say though that Australia is doing very well. If we do end up doing a deal Australia will do even better. And we were discussing that. But Australia will be one of the big beneficiaries of a deal.And in the meantime as you know I did tariff relief with respect to a certain product in particular coming out of Australia. And that's something that we wouldn't do for anybody else. This has been a truly great ally and we work very well together.But you\u2014your numbers are absolutely fantastic. Your economy is strong like ours. And I think we're two real examples of two countries doing extremely well. Some countries aren't doing so well. That's true. Europe is not doing well. Asia is not doing\u2014large parts of Asia are not doing well. China is not doing well.Please. Thanks. Mr. President Australia is in its 29th year of consecutive economic growth which is an extraordinary national achievement. And we will continue to grow as our most recent national accounts demonstrated.Australia is also very used to dealing with a complex and changing world. And that's why we've diversified our trade base and have been doing that for many years. I mean 6 years ago when our government came to office 27 percent of our trade was covered by agreements around the world. That figure is now 70 percent and we're going to take that to 90 percent. And that's important. And that's opening up opportunities.So there are ebbs and flows that go in the global economy and Australia has built up a resilience through the broad-based nature in which we're taking our economy to the world. I mean Australia has never got rich selling things to itself. And we've always had an outward looking perspective when it comes to engaging our economic opportunities.And a big part of what we've been discussing here is some new opportunities whether it's in the rare earth metals the critical minerals the frontier technologies space. You know this is where jobs are going to be in the future as well. And so we will deal with those ebbs and flows as they come.But the President is right: The arrangement they will come to\u2014and I'm confident they will\u2014with China will be one that will set you know a new bar in terms of how China's economy then deals with a lot of these complicated issues in the future with developed economies like Australia. So we look on with interest. And I think ultimately when we arrive at that point it's going to put global trade on a stronger footing. And Australia has really been so focused on the economy. They do minerals. They have incredible wealth in minerals and coal and other things.And they are really at the leading edge of coal technology. It's clean coal. We call it clean coal but it's also great for the workers. And things that would happen to\u2014because it was very dangerous years ago and very bad for a lot of people. And you've rectified that 100 percent. It's incredible. I looked at your statistics the other day and coal miners are very very safe in Australia. True. It's incredible what you've done. In fact we're looking at what you've done. [] But so\u2014\u2014 We can do a deal on that. So I want to\u2014I want to\u2014we'll do a deal. We'll make a deal.Yes. Go ahead. Please.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat do you say to Australian businesses and to Australian people who say that your trade war with President Xi threatens their prosperity?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

What is he recommending to you in terms of dealing with the latest strikes on Saudi Arabia and the response?And then, secondly, you announced new sanctions on Iran. Secretary Mnuchin said that this affects the last available funds for that regime. Have we now exhausted sanctions in regards to Iran?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell these are the strongest sanctions ever put on a country. We are at a level of sanction that is far greater than ever before with respect to Iran. Today we did Central Bank as you know. And we'll see. We'll see.They're having a lot of problems not only with us; they're having problems within their own country. And I think they have a lot of self-made problems.We are by far the strongest military in the world. Going into Iran would be a very easy decision. As I said before it'd be very easy. The easiest thing. Most people thought I would go in within 2 seconds but plenty of time. Plenty of time.In the meantime they have a lot of problems within Iran. Iran could be a great country could be a rich country. But they are choosing to go a different way. There'll be a point at which they'll be very sorry for that choice. But I think I'm showing great restraint. A lot of people respect it; some people don't. Some people say Oh you should go in immediately. And other people are so thrilled at what I'm doing. And I don't do it for anybody; I do it for what's good for the United States what's good for our allies. And it's working out really very well.As far as Robert is concerned he's\u2014Robert maybe you could stand up? Robert O'Brien is done a fantastic job for us with hostage negotiations. I think we can say that there has never been anybody that has done better than you and I as a combination. We've brought many people home and we brought them home quickly. Speed is a very important thing I find with hostages. It's really something.I had dinner the other night with the Warmbier family an incredible family\u2014the whole family and some of Otto's friends in addition to the family. We had 25 people over on Saturday night. And we did that dinner in Otto\u2014really in Otto's honor. And it was a beautiful thing. It was a beautiful thing.The First Lady and I it was very\u2014you know it was very touching and really very beautiful. We talked about Otto. And I will tell you that people should have moved faster. And Robert and I were talking about that. Should have moved faster. He was there for a long time.You've got to move fast. With hostages you have to move fast. All of a sudden it gets very hard for the other side to do anything. And sometimes it's just too late. In the case of Otto it was very late. We got him home but he was in horrible horrible condition. What happened to him was actually incredible and just horrible.But you have to move fast. Robert and I have been really successful. And the reason I know him so well\u2014I actually work hard on hostages I think he would say. I think most Presidents wouldn't do that but I do. These are great\u2014I guess in almost all cases\u2014American lives. And we help other people also. We've also helped other countries with their hostage situation where we have some strength that they don't.But these are great people. And we get them home. We got them home from North Korea as you know. And we got them home from a lot of different locations. Egypt\u2014we got them home. We got them home from many different locations. Turkey. President Erdogan was very good. And we got a hostage home who\u2014our great pastor who everyone in this room knows and loves.But we've had tremendous success. And what's surprised me I didn't know too many people knew Robert. And when it came time to pick somebody for the position\u2014it's a very critical time\u2014I had so many people\u2014I shouldn't say this in front of Robert he'll be embarrassed but I had so many people that called me and they recommended Robert O'Brien. So I think he's going to do a great job.And he was here\u2014I can tell you this\u2014he started about 12 minutes after he was chosen. He sat in with us. And he's very much involved now on what we're doing.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHave we now exhausted sanctions in regards to Iran?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Would you agree to meet with Mr. Rouhani?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nIf the circumstances were correct or right, I would certainly agree to that. But in the meantime, they have to be good players. You understand what that means. And they can't do what they were saying they're going to do because if they do that, they're going to be met with really very violent force. We'd have no choice. So I think they're going to be good. I really think they'd like to.And by the way, President Macron told me every step that he was making yesterday. A lot of you said, Oh, he came in and\u2014he told me long before he came in what was happening, what was\u2014I didn't think it was appropriate to meet yesterday. Too soon, and things have to be worked out first.But President Macron told me exactly what was happening, who was coming, what time they were coming, where they were going to meet. And after the meeting, he told me exactly what happened. And I think he had a very positive meeting.Prime Minister Abe of Japan, also a large purchaser of oil from , he was also very much involved. And you know, look, he knows everybody there, so he was a very, very positive force. But I have to tell you the President has done an excellent job, and we're going to see how it all turns out. Maybe it works; maybe it doesn't. I say it all the time about everything: Maybe it works, and maybe it doesn't. But I'll tell you what, we made a ridiculous deal. We gave them $150 billion. We gave them $1.8 billion, and we got nothing. We got nothing. And by the way, that agreement was so short term that it expires in a very short period of time. With a country, you don't make a deal that short. Countries last for long times, and you don't do short-term deals, especially when you're paying that kind of money.So I have\u2014I have good feelings about . I have good feelings that it will work. I know many ians living in New York City. I have many friends from . They're incredible people. Incredible people. So the last thing I'd like to see is a big problem.

And I think if they don't make a deal, it's going to be very bad for China. And I very much appreciate the fact that they came out last night\u2014very late last night\u2014and they said, you know, they want to make a deal. They want it to be under calm circumstances.

What reassurances, if any, can you give the American people that you are not looking to profit off the Presidency?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I'll tell you what: I've spent\u2014and I think I will, in a combination of loss and opportunity, probably, it will cost me anywhere from three to five billion dollars to be President. And the only thing I care about is this country. Couldn't care less. Otherwise, I wouldn't have done it.People have asked me, What do you think it costs? And between opportunity, not doing things\u2014I used to get a lot of money to make speeches. Now I give speeches all the time. You know what I get? Zippo. And that's good. And I did a lot of great jobs and great deals that I don't do anymore. And I don't want to do them, because the deals I'm making are great deals for the country. And that's, to me, much more important.Doral happens to be within Miami. It's a city. It's a wonderful place. It's a very, very successful area of Florida. It's, very importantly, only 5 minutes from the airport; the airport is right next door. It's a big international airport, one of the biggest in the world. Everybody that's coming\u2014all of these people with all of their big entourages come. It's set up so\u2014and, by the way, my people looked at 12 sites. All good, but some were 2 hours from an airport. Some were 4 hours from\u2014I mean, they were so far away. Some didn't allow this, or they didn't allow that.With Doral, we have a series of magnificent buildings; we call them bungalows. They each hold from 50 to 70 very luxurious rooms with magnificent views. We have incredible conference rooms, incredible restaurants. It's like\u2014it's like such a natural\u2014we wouldn't even have to do the work that they did here. And they've done a beautiful job. They've really done a beautiful job.And what we have also is Miami. And we have many hundreds of acres, so that in terms of parking, in terms of all of the things that you need, the ballrooms are among the biggest in Florida and the best. It's brandnew. And they want\u2014my people wanted it. From my standpoint, I'm not going to make any money. In my opinion, I'm not going to make any money. I don't want to make money. I don't care about making money. If I wanted to make money, I wouldn't worry about $3 billion to $5 billion. Because that's what\u2014I mean, at some point, I'm going to detail that and will show.But I think it's just a great place to be. I think having it in Miami is fantastic. Really fantastic. Having it at that particular place, because of the way it's set up, each country can have their own villa, or their own bungalow. And the bungalows, when I say, they have a lot of units in them. So I think it just works out well.And when my people came back, they took tours, they went to different places. I won't mention places, but you'll have a list, because they're going to give a presentation on it fairly soon. They went to places all over the country. And they came back, and they said, This is where we'd like it to be. Now, we had military people doing it. We had Secret Service people doing it. We had people that really understand what it's about. It's not about me, it's about getting the right location. I think it's very important.Jonathan.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat reassurances, if any, can you give the American people that you are not looking to profit off the Presidency?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

I really don't. A lot of people don't understand this. I ran one election, and I won. It happened to be for President. I don't care politically. I'm going to run another election. I think I'm winning based on polls that we see. Whether I win or not, I have to do the right thing.So I don't do things for political reasons. Is it good? Probably not. Maybe it is. I mean, a lot of people are smart. A lot of people say having Russia\u2014which is a power\u2014having them inside the room is better than having them outside the room. By the way, there were numerous people during the G-7 that felt that way. And we didn't take a vote or anything, but we did discuss it.My inclination is to say, Yes, they should be in. They were\u2014really, it was a President Obama\u2014I'm not blaming him, but a lot of bad things happened with President Putin and President Obama. One of the things that happened was, as you know, what happened in\u2014with a very big area\u2014a very, very big and important area in the Middle East, where the redline was drawn, and then President Obama decided that he was not going to do anything about it. You can't draw redlines in the sand. You just can't do it.And the other was in Ukraine having to do with a certain section of Ukraine that you know very well, where it was sort of taken away from President Obama.

But there were phone calls, sir? Mr. President, there were phone calls?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNumerous calls. And as I have said before, there were communications that went back and forth over the last 2 days, as recent as last night. And not only with Steve; there were calls with other people too.Just so you understand: China wants to make a deal. Now, whether or not we make a deal\u2014it's got to be a great deal for us. You know\u2014and I told this to President Xi, who I really respect. I really do. I have great respect, and I like him too. And he's a tough guy, but I have a lot of feeling for President Xi. He's very outstanding in so many ways.But I told him very strongly\u2014I said: Look, you're starting up here, and you're making $500 billion a year and stealing our intellectual property. We're down on the floor, lower than the floor. You can't make a 50/50 deal. This has to be a deal that's better for us. And if it's not better, let's not do business together. I don't want to do business. Forget about tariffs for a second. We're taking in tremendous amounts of money. Forget that. I don't want to do business.Now, when I raise and he raises, I raise and he raises, we can never catch up. We have to balance our trading relationship at least to an extent. And they were unwilling to do that, and we'll never have a deal if that happens. But it's going to happen, because they have to have a deal.And as far as phone calls are concerned, Secretary of the Treasury and other people have been receiving many calls\u2014not receiving\u2014back and forth, many calls.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nBut there were phone calls, sir?

I'm going to let him sell his ideas. But a lot of people don't disagree with his ideas.But it's a very hard thing to do if you're a great citizen of France. You love your country, but you want to do the way you've been doing it for a long time. But maybe that's not working. And maybe they have to do what he has to do. I think he's going to do a fantastic job. But it's very tough for him. I know how tough it is for him. He's been having a hard time. And nobody would have any easy time. But I do believe he is doing the right thing.Boris is different. It's a different kind of a deal. Boris has to try and do something with Brexit. It's very tough. I deal with the EU. The EU is\u2014that's a very, very strong group of people. They have their ideas, and they're not easy to deal with, I will tell you.We've very close to making a deal, by the way, with the EU. I have to say this. We made a great deal with Japan. And we're very close to maybe making a deal with the EU. Because they don't want tariffs; it's very simple. They don't want to tax cars. Mercedes Benz, BMW, they don't need a 20-percent or a 25-percent tax. But we're very close. I think we're going to make a deal with the EU without having to go that route. I may have to go that route, but maybe not.We're going to have a deal, a really fair deal. But the EU is another one. We've been losing $180 billion a year for many years. That's a lot of money.

And Russia was literally involved in all of those four or five matters. And a few of the people looked up and said, you know, Why aren't they here talking to us about it? And we go: What are we going to do now? Go home? Take it easy for a day? Although, I'm not doing that. I don't take it easy.But what are we going to do? We're going to go home and start calling them at the end of the week and say, Hey, how about this? They could have been in the room.We had numerous things that we were discussing. Right? Numerous. We had a lot of things that we were discussing, and it would've been very easy if Russia was in the room. If he was in the room, we could've solved those things. Now they're just in limbo. But I have to say, with all of that, very little in limbo.But somebody will speak to him about some things, and frankly, they're not very complicated. But it would be easier if they were in the room.

It's\u2014if I had information and if I had absolute proof\u2014some of the stories that we've heard, which are not easy, which is not easy to get\u2014I would go in and do a number to those countries like you wouldn't believe. What they do to Christians in the Middle East\u2014and it's disgraceful. It's disgraceful. You're right.It's a very big part of the overall negotiation. And as countries come in\u2014for instance, U.A.E. has agreed very strongly to represent us; I think they will very well with respect to Christianity, because in the Middle East, it's not treated well.

You mentioned the Executive orders that you signed. Are we now unlikely to see any more stimulus legislation before the election?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell we're giving $400. And we are in constant touch with Governors also who\u2014they'll be making perhaps a contribution. They have options. They can do it or they don't have to do it. I think most of them will do it.We're also doing a payroll tax cut which is a massive number. That's a very big number. And that's a number that's bigger than the\u2014any of the numbers we talked about. And the beauty of that is that it really incentivizes companies and\u2014because it's both a company cut and a employee cut. So that much really\u2014very much incentivizes people to go back to work and work hard and the company to hire people back. And we've had some of the great economic minds saying that's the most important cut; that would be the best cut you could do.We couldn't get the Democrats to even think about agreeing to it. It's not the Democrat way I guess. Because it just seems that whether it's Larry Kudlow or any of your many friends that's the one they wanted the most. Would you say Larry? Yes sir. The President. And so we're doing that. And that was never even really discussed because that was taken off the table by the Democrats immediately.And this is every week. Every week you get a check\u2014or a month or biweekly. This is a major amount of money that you're getting directly. So it's really\u2014you know it's a very big number. It's very substantial number. And this is\u2014don't forget this is in addition to the $400. And this is a big number.And now at the end of the year on the assumption that I win I'm going to terminate the payroll tax which is another thing that some of the great economists would like to see done. We'll be paying into Social Security through the general fund. And it works out very nicely.If Biden would win he wouldn't do that because he's going to double and triple everybody's taxes. He's going to have to explain that one. And as you know he's also going to quadruple regulations. He wants to put regulations on.One of the reasons that we had the kind of numbers and big bounces that you've seen\u2014I mean we closed it up. We saved millions of lives and now we opened it and we bounce right back where we were. It looks like we'll be bouncing right back where we were. But one of the reasons is because we cut so many horrible regulations.And Biden with his new partner Kamala will\u2014if you think\u2014he's going to put it all back but many times more. I mean they want to increase regulations and that's just going to drive companies out and it's going to drive people out. It's going to drive them to other countries and it's going to make us not competitive with other countries.Please OAN.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAre we now unlikely to see any more stimulus legislation before the election?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Could you tell us what you're planning to do in the Executive order and your reaction to what happened in the Senate?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, the Senate Republicans want very much to pass a bill on police reform. We have total cooperation with many different communities, including the police community. They want it very much to happen themselves, because there are things that they agreed to that they would like to agree to, and they would love to have it agreed to formally.The Democrats don't want to do it, because they want to weaken our police. They want to take away immunity. They want to do other things that you know about as well as anybody in this beautiful field that we sit. They want to take away a lot of the strength from our police and from law enforcement, generally, and we can't live with that. We can't live with that.This is a great bill, strongly endorsed by, as you know, Tim Scott, who's terrific, who is a terrific man, great Senator\u2014South Carolina. And Mitch wants it to happen. I would like to see it happen. But we won't sacrifice. We won't do that. We won't do anything that's going to hurt our police.The police\u2014you know, we have a record this year on crime\u2014a record positive rating on crime this year, the best. And you hear about certain places like Chicago, and you hear about what's going on in Detroit and other cities, all Democrat run. Every one of them is Democrat run. Twenty out of 20. The 20 worst, the 20 most dangerous are Democrat run. We have one city or two cities in particular\u2014worse than Honduras, worse than Afghanistan. Worse than Afghanistan.And these are cities within the United States, Democrat run, radical-left run. You see what's going on in Seattle. You see what's going on in other places. Seattle, of all places\u2014who would even think that's possible? Twenty out of 20. The Democrats want to weaken very substantially our law enforcement and our police. And, frankly, they want to defund, largely\u2014at least largely. There are some that want to defund and abolish our police, if you can believe that, and we're not letting that happen.So if nothing happens with it, it's one of those things\u2014we have different philosophies. They want open borders. They want sanctuary cities. We don't.As far as your number\u2014your second question, I think that we're going to have a very strong Executive order, but we already have very strong. We have the monuments act already, which\u2014which means 10 years in jail. But I think we're going to consolidate various things. We're going to come out with a very strong Executive order, and I should have that by the end of the week, which is fast approaching. We're going to have it very\u2014a very powerful statement.We've arrested numerous people, as you know, for what took place outside of Washington. In addition, the FBI is investigating hundreds of people throughout the country for what they've done to monuments, statues, and even buildings.So we have very strong laws already in the books, and we have a law that's 10 years. It's 10 years. That's a long time to have fun 1 night. I think many of the people that are knocking down these statues don't even have any idea what the statue is, what it means, who it is, when they knock down Grant\u2014when they want to knock down Grant. But when they look at certain\u2014now they're looking at Jesus Christ. They're looking at George Washington. They're looking at Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson. Not going to happen. Not going to happen. Not as long as I'm here.As far as Democrats are concerned, I think they could care less whether or not it happens. And I think the American people get it. So we're going to have a very strong Executive order, and it'll happen very quickly, before the end of the week.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat is the President planning to do in the Executive order regarding monuments and people who deface or damage them?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

These are bad people and very bad for our country.Thank you very much, everybody.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nwould you consider delaying the State of the Union if the impeachment trial has not ended by February 4?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Do you trust that they are sincere about this?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI do. I think they want to make a deal very badly. I think that was elevated last night, very late in the night. I see an alert\u2014or, as you would call it, breaking news. And it was that the Vice Chairman\u2014we're not talking about somebody from China at a low level\u2014the Vice Chairman of China came out that he wants to see a deal made, he wants it to be made under calm conditions, using the word calm. I agree with him on that.And China has taken a very hard hit over the last number of months. You know, they've lost 3 million jobs. It will soon be much more than 3 million jobs. Their chain is breaking. A chain is breaking up like nobody has seen before. And once that happens, it's very hard to put it back together. You understand.I think they want\u2014very much want\u2014to make a deal. And the longer they wait, the harder it is to put it back, if it can be put back at all. So I believe they want to do a deal.The tariffs have hit them very hard in a fairly short period of time. The United States will have collected over $100 billion in tariffs. And I say it again: The reporters failed to\u2014the media failed to acknowledge it. But if you look at the goods coming in from China\u2014we're talking about China, not other countries. If you look at the goods, they have a power that others don't have. But that power is only good for so long.They've manipulated their currency, they've devalued their currency, and they put a lot of cash into the system. And because of that, the prices have not gone up. Or if they've gone up, it's been very little, because they want to keep people working. If the prices go up, they're not going to be able to keep people working; they're not going to be able to compete. It's a brilliant market. It's a brilliant, brilliant market, the world market. A lot of markets are brilliant.And frankly, I think that China cannot\u2014I don't know, maybe they can, maybe they can't. I don't think they can do that. And I think they're very smart. And I think President Xi is a great leader, who happens to be a brilliant man. And he can't lose 3 million jobs in a very short period of time. And that's going to be magnified many times over. And it's going to break down the Chinese system of trade, and he can't do that.So when you say, Do you think they want to? Maybe they want to, and maybe they don't. But I think they want to make a deal. I'm not sure they have a choice. And I don't say that as a threat. I don't think they have a choice. In the meantime, the United States, which has never collected 10 cents from China, will, in a fairly short period of time, be over $100 billion in tariffs. So I think they want to make a deal very badly. Okay?Go ahead.
