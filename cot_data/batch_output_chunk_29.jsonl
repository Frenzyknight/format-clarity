The President\u2019s response clearly provides reasons: Africa has been a priority from the start of his administration; it is in the U.S. national interest to combat hopelessness and diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria; it is in the U.S. moral interest and consistent with his principle that \u201cto whom much is given, much is required\u201d; and the timing of the visit is linked to the fact that U.S. efforts are now producing tangible results.
