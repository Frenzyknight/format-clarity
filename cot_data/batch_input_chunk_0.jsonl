And one of the things that is going on now is, China is beginning to change some of the rules of the game, in terms of trade and other issues.And so one of the things we talked about, for example, is that they're now talking about making sure that no Chineseno one in the Chinese Government can use a Western cell phone. Those kinds of things.And so, really, what this trip was aboutit was less about containing China. I don't want to contain China. I just want to make sure that we have a relationship with China that is on the up and up, squared away, everybody knows what it's all about. And one of the ways you do that is, you make sure that we are talking about the same things.And I think that one of the things we've doneI've tried to do, and I've talked with a number of my staff about this for the last, I guess, 6 monthsis, we have an opportunity to strengthen alliances around the world to maintain stability.That's what this trip was all about: having India cooperate much more with the United States, be closer with the United States, Vietnam being closer with the United States. It's not about containing China; it's about having a stable base, a stable base in the Indo-Pacific.And it'sfor example, when I was spending a lot of time talking with President Xi, he asked why we were doingwhy was I going to have the Quad, meaning Australia, India, Japan, and the United States? And I said, To maintain stability. It's not about isolating China. It's about making sure the rules of the roadeverything from airspace and space in the ocean isthe international rules of the road are abided by.And soand I hope thatI think that Prime Minister XiI mean, Xi has somesome difficulties right now. All countries end up with difficulties, and he had some economic difficulties he's working his way through.

I've spent more time with him than any other world leader has, sum total, over the last 12 years. So I hope we get to see him again soon.But no, lookfor example, one of the things we did in India: We provided for a new path that's going to save everybody money, increase the Third Worldthe Third Worldthe Global South's capacity to grow by sendingwe're going tofromwe're going to have a new railroad from India all the way across to the Mediterranean, new shipping lanes and pipelines across the Mediterranean through Europe, up into Great Britain and beyond.That's all about economic growth. That has nothing to do with hurting China or helping China. It has to do with dealing with everything from climate change to making sure that these countries can succeed economically and grow.Look, my thesis has been, from the beginning, both domestically and in terms of foreign policy: Invest in your people. Invest in the people. Give them a chance.Everything is better off when peopleI know it's going to sound trite. If everybody in the world had a job they get up in the morning and wanted to go to and thought theyand they could put three squares in the table for their family, no matter where they live, the whole world be better off. We'd be a lot better. That's the notion here behind this.For example, you know, one of the things we're doing in terms ofI proposed a long time ago at the G-7, now it'sthat's going to come to fruition at the G-20, is making sure that we build a railroad all the way across the African Continent. Think about it. There is no way to cross the African Continent by roadby rail. And there's not even a direct highway across.Now, let's assume for the sake of discussionwhen we talk about food shortagesassume there was one country in that vast continent that had aan excess of foodstuffs and resources. How would they get it to where they're going to go? How are they going to do it?That's why we're also going to invest billions of dollars in solar facilities in Angola to have the largestthe largest solar facility in the worldamong the largest. That helps Angola, but it also helps the whole region.So I think we think too much in terms of cold war terms. It's not about that.

There was no agreement at the G-20 on fossil fuels. How concerned are you about this lack of consensus?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nIt wasn't so much an agreement that we would try to meet the goals at the G-20. The United States is going to meet those goals, by the way. We're going to exceed those goals. A lot of other countries are as well.But we want to give those countries that don't have the economic wherewithal and did not cause the problem in the first placefor example, I met with Lula in Brazil.I started off way back in the eighties with a really fine Republican Senator named Dick Lugar. We said: Here's what we're going to do. If you owe us money, we're going to forgive your debt if you maintain your forest. Because they become carbon sinks. They're the things that take carbon out of the air.And so we're talking to what we should be goand the countries that cleared their land and put cattle on there and farming and did all the things thatand increased development, they, in fact, are the onesthe reasons whythe main reason why we've gotten as far down the road to disaster here as we have.And so it seemsand if we have the economic capacity, wethose nations should be getting together and providing help for the nations that don't have the wherewithal to do it, the economic wherewithal and the infrastructure wherewithal.And that's why, for example, I mentionedin the interest of time, I'll just mention Angola again. Angola has the capacity to generate megawatts of energy through solar energy. They don't have the economic means to do that. Isn't it in the interest of the whole world if they are, in fact, able to generate significant capacity to absorbto prevent carbon from being released in the air? I think that it is.So what we're trying to do is help those nations. Theand particularly in the Global South, where they're not as wealthy, where there are not as many opportunities to be able to deal with the things that they want to deal with.For exampleand I'll end with thisthere is more carbon absorbed from the atmosphere on a daily basisand I'll look to mymy friend, John Kerry, who'd forgotten more about this than most people knowcorrect me if I get this wrong, John, but I'm quite sure I'm rightand that is that there's more carbon observed [absorbed; White House correction] from the air into the Amazon region into the groundthe groundthan emitted in the entire United States on the same basis.Now, imagine if people go in and do what we did 150, 200, 250 years ago and cut down the forest and thestart farming in that area, no longer have that great carbon sink. Weyou know, it's goingit would be a gigantic problem.So we should be going to areas, whether it's in the Congo or other places, as the G-7 nations and as the wealthy G-20 nations, theand providing the kind of infrastructure they need to be able to benefit.And guess what? In addition to helping the environment overalland the only existential threat humanity faces even more frightening than a nuclear war is global warming going above 1.5 degrees in the next 2010 years. We'rethat'd be real trouble. There's no way back from that.And so there's a lot we can do in the meantime. For example, that pipelinethat railroad we're talking about going across from the middlefrom India, throughout the Middle East, and toacross the Mediterranean and all through Europe, that's going to have a hydrogen pipeline there. This is going to significantly reduce the amount of carbon emitted in the air, but it costs a lot of money to put that down. And the world is going to say it's in our interestcollective interest to do it.So I have notI have not given up at all on the notion that we're going to be able to, you knowhow can I say it? I think we can triple the renewable capacity foras it relates to global warmingby the year 20302030.Countries following the IRA playbook, which is the one we passedthe clean energy jobs, they're going to create manufacturing jobs.For example, as a consequence of what we've done, we have the mostwe have the mostwe have the strongest economy in the world today. Right now, today, the United States of America has the strongest economy in the worldin the world. Now, we've got more to do, but we have the strongest economy in the world.And one of the reasons we're doing itwe changed the mechanism of how we deal with this. And that is instead of trickle-down economythat is if the wealthy and the corporations do very well, everybody is going to do well.Well, the truth of the matter is, I've never bought that theory. But I think the times have changed, and a lot of leading economists are beginning to agree with mejust flat, straight-out academic economistsand that is: We should build economic growth from the middle out and the bottom up.When that happens, everybody does well. Everybody does well. The wealthy still do very, very well. They have no problem. You can still be a billionaire under that system as well. But you're going to start paying your taxes if I have anything to do it. That's a different issue.But all kidding asideso there'swe haveI think the other thing that's dawning on peoplemany of you who are foreign policy experts have been engaged for a long time. Did you ever think you'd be sitting at a G-20 conference where everyone was preoccupied with the notion of global warming? Not a joke. Did you ever think that?And there's amy brother loves havingthere's famous lines from movies that he always quotes. You know, it'sand one of them isthere's a movie about John Wayne. He's an Indian scout. And they're trying to get theI think it was the Apacheone of the great tribes of America back on the reservation.And he's standing with a Union soldierso he'sthey're all on theirand they're on their horses in their saddles. And there's three or four Indians in headdresses, and the Union soldiersand the Union soldiers are basically saying to the Indians: Come with me, we'll take care of you. We'lleverything will be good. And the Indian scoutthe Indian looks at John Wayne and points to the Union soldier and says, He's a lying, dog-faced pony soldier.Well, there's a lot of lying, dog-faced pony soldiers out there about global warming, but not anymore. All of a sudden, they're all realizing it's a problem. And there's nothing like seeing the light.Forand let's see. I'm just following my orders here.Staff, is there anybody I haven't spoken to?[] The President. No, I ain't calling on you. I'm calling onI said there were five questions. AnitaAnita from VOA.

Hi, I'm Jongjin Park of Money Today. First of all, I would like to ask a question to President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea. I heard that you stated that a new chapter has opened in our trilateral cooperation with the two countries. Compared to the previous summits, what would be the most significant outcome that you gained through this summit?And also, from the perspective of our people, what would be the benefit that the people of Korea would feel from these strengthening of ties?And now my question goes to President Biden. During this summit, the issues of detainees or prisoners of wars\u2014and you mentioned that there will be further cooperation in these human rights issues. And you also said you will support the free and peaceful Korean Peninsula in the region. And what would\u2014what kind of shift would there be in your policy? And what kind of specific solutions do you have in this regard?Lastly, I would like to direct my question to Prime Minister Kishida. Today we had a historic trilateral summit. However, there was much backlash and many concerns in Korea. However, President Yoon showed his political courage to do so. That's the international community's evaluation.However, there are still concerns that the\u2014Japan is making very passive efforts to resolve our issues that still remain. And also, how would you be able to show your truthful willingness to resolve and improve our bilateral relations going forward?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nFirst of all, this trilateral cooperation amongst our three countries has opened a new chapter, and we made that announcement today to talk about the differences from the past cooperation.For instance, in the past, it was about individual issues that we sought cooperation among ourselves. But now, as we have opened a new chapter in our cooperation for security, economy, science and technology, and development cooperation for the Global South, health, and women\u2014across all of these issues, our three countries decided to closely work together. So it's much more comprehensive in nature.Such comprehensive cooperation has been launched by us today because currently we face complicated crisis and the threat from the D.P.R.K. And across the world, we believe that we can together make a contribution to freedom and peace around the world.So that is our foundational understanding and our common and shared interests of the three countries. And not just for exclusionary interests of ourselves. Our interests are well aligned with the universal interests of the members of the global community. That's where we find our shared interests lie.And at the same time, this framework of comprehensive cooperation among our three countries will contribute to global supply chain resilience, global financial market stability, cooperation in the frontier technology sectors and science.Our three countries together have the best-in-class expertise in science and technology. And we are the ones who are implementing liberal democracies. Naturally, progress in science and technologies will bring benefits\u2014tangible benefits\u2014to our people, not just in terms of security, but also in terms of economy and science and technology.But what is most important here is not about our own interests only. When we put our forces together, I believe that we can make a contribution to the advancement of freedom and peace in the world. And that's exactly where our interests are aligned. I\u2014look, back in May of 2022, I met with the families of the Japanese abductees during my visit, heard their stories, and empathized with them and got a sense of the pain they're feeling. It's real.We know there are many families out there who still wait and worry and wonder. And we're not going to forget about them or their loved ones.And there's clear language on this on our joint statement. The bottom line is this: That we share a common position; we're committed to working together to see the return of all prisoners of war and those who've been abducted and detained.And by the way, one of the things we get asked many times\u2014and it wasn't directly asked, but implied\u2014is what makes us think any of this is positive. Success brings success. When other nations see cooperation in the region, they make judgments about: Would they be better off if they made commitments? Will they move?Think about\u2014as students of history, all of you; and you are\u2014think about how many times successes have generated other successes when you don't anticipate it.And so I just think this is a\u2014we're not going to forget, we're not giving up, and we're going to continue to make the case for the freedom of all of those detainees. With regard to your question for me, first of all, I have strong feelings about strengthening bilateral relationships between the R.O.K. and Japan. I share that with The two countries, in dealing with international challenges, should cooperate. We're both important neighboring countries. And so friendship with President Yoon and a relationship of trust, based on this, both countries as partners should open up a new era. And that is my thinking.This year, President Yoon came to Japan, and I visited the R.O.K. At international fora, we have repeated meetings\u2014we have had repeated meetings. And between our two countries, including the economy and security, we've had forward-looking and concrete approaches which were started. It's already in motion, dynamically.Economic security dialogue was started\u2014or it has been decided on. In the area of export control, there have been progress. And also Financial Ministers and Defense Ministers have had meetings.And so we've had this very positive, forward-looking developments. And these are seen not only in the public sector. Also in the private sector, we see a slate of developments, human exchanges, and exchanges between business circles. We're seeing very active developments in all of these areas, and that is a reality.Going forward, we hope to accumulate these approaches with\u2014along with President Yoon to strengthen our bilateral relations even further. By generating results, we hope that people will understand Japan's feelings towards our bilateral relations. And we'd like to continue such efforts.Thank you. Thank you very much.Then, let me see.

But now, as we have opened a new chapter in our cooperation for security, economy, science and technology, and development cooperation for the Global South, health, and women\u2014across all of these issues, our three countries decided to closely work together. So it's much more comprehensive in nature.Such comprehensive cooperation has been launched by us today because currently we face complicated crisis and the threat from the D.P.R.K. And across the world, we believe that we can together make a contribution to freedom and peace around the world.So that is our foundational understanding and our common and shared interests of the three countries. And not just for exclusionary interests of ourselves. Our interests are well aligned with the universal interests of the members of the global community. That's where we find our shared interests lie.And at the same time, this framework of comprehensive cooperation among our three countries will contribute to global supply chain resilience, global financial market stability, cooperation in the frontier technology sectors and science.Our three countries together have the best-in-class expertise in science and technology. And we are the ones who are implementing liberal democracies. Naturally, progress in science and technologies will bring benefits\u2014tangible benefits\u2014to our people, not just in terms of security, but also in terms of economy and science and technology.But what is most important here is not about our own interests only. When we put our forces together, I believe that we can make a contribution to the advancement of freedom and peace in the world. And that's exactly where our interests are aligned. I\u2014look, back in May of 2022, I met with the families of the Japanese abductees during my visit, heard their stories, and empathized with them and got a sense of the pain they're feeling. It's real.We know there are many families out there who still wait and worry and wonder. And we're not going to forget about them or their loved ones.And there's clear language on this on our joint statement. The bottom line is this: That we share a common position; we're committed to working together to see the return of all prisoners of war and those who've been abducted and detained.And by the way, one of the things we get asked many times\u2014and it wasn't directly asked, but implied\u2014is what makes us think any of this is positive. Success brings success. When other nations see cooperation in the region, they make judgments about: Would they be better off if they made commitments? Will they move?Think about\u2014as students of history, all of you; and you are\u2014think about how many times successes have generated other successes when you don't anticipate it.And so I just think this is a\u2014we're not going to forget, we're not giving up, and we're going to continue to make the case for the freedom of all of those detainees. With regard to your question for me, first of all, I have strong feelings about strengthening bilateral relationships between the R.O.K. and Japan. I share that with The two countries, in dealing with international challenges, should cooperate. We're both important neighboring countries. And so friendship with President Yoon and a relationship of trust, based on this, both countries as partners should open up a new era. And that is my thinking.This year, President Yoon came to Japan, and I visited the R.O.K. At international fora, we have repeated meetings\u2014we have had repeated meetings. And between our two countries, including the economy and security, we've had forward-looking and concrete approaches which were started. It's already in motion, dynamically.Economic security dialogue was started\u2014or it has been decided on. In the area of export control, there have been progress. And also Financial Ministers and Defense Ministers have had meetings.And so we've had this very positive, forward-looking developments. And these are seen not only in the public sector. Also in the private sector, we see a slate of developments, human exchanges, and exchanges between business circles. We're seeing very active developments in all of these areas, and that is a reality.Going forward, we hope to accumulate these approaches with\u2014along with President Yoon to strengthen our bilateral relations even further. By generating results, we hope that people will understand Japan's feelings towards our bilateral relations. And we'd like to continue such efforts.Thank you. Thank you very much.Then, let me see.

Hi, I'm Jongjin Park of Money Today. First of all, I would like to ask a question to President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea. I heard that you stated that a new chapter has opened in our trilateral cooperation with the two countries. Compared to the previous summits, what would be the most significant outcome that you gained through this summit?And also, from the perspective of our people, what would be the benefit that the people of Korea would feel from these strengthening of ties?And now my question goes to President Biden. During this summit, the issues of detainees or prisoners of wars\u2014and you mentioned that there will be further cooperation in these human rights issues. And you also said you will support the free and peaceful Korean Peninsula in the region. And what would\u2014what kind of shift would there be in your policy? And what kind of specific solutions do you have in this regard?Lastly, I would like to direct my question to Prime Minister Kishida. Today we had a historic trilateral summit. However, there was much backlash and many concerns in Korea. However, President Yoon showed his political courage to do so. That's the international community's evaluation.However, there are still concerns that the\u2014Japan is making very passive efforts to resolve our issues that still remain.

Peace and security in Europe is essential to U.S. security and peace. The idea that there could be conflict in Europe among our friends and us not engaged has never happened in modern history.

Did those comments about President Xi undermine or complicate the progress your administration has made in maintaining a relationship with China?And secondly, on India: As you raise these broader issues of human rights and democracy, what is your message to those, including some members of your own party, who say that your administration is overlooking the targeting of religious minorities and crackdown on dissent in Prime Minister Modi's country?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThe answer to your first question is: No. You know, what\u2014when we're talking to our allies and partners around the world, including India, we let the idea of my choosing and avoiding saying what I think is the facts with regard to the relationship with India\u2014with China is\u2014just not something I'm going to change very much.I think we\u2014I believe that\u2014and I've said this for some time\u2014that the hysteria about the relationship with China is collapsing and moving, et cetera, et cetera\u2014we had an incident that caused some confusion, you might say. But President\u2014but Secretary Blinken had a great trip to China. I expect to be meeting with President Xi sometime in the future, in the near term. And I don't think it's had any real consequence.And what was your second question?\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDid the comments about President Xi undermine or complicate the progress made in maintaining a relationship with China?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

And it's a common democratic character of both our countries that\u2014and our people\u2014our diversity; our culture; our open, tolerant, robust debate.And I believe that we believe in the dignity of every citizen. And it is in America's DNA and, I believe, in India's DNA that the whole world\u2014the whole world\u2014has a stake in our success, both of us, in maintaining our democracies.

[Laughter] Yes, they're holding on to it.Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez with the PBS NewsHour. All over the country, Mr. President, Republican-led States are passing laws\u2014passing anti-LGBTQ, antitransgender laws that restrict rights and medical care. Intimidation is on the rise. This week, anti-LGBTQ protesters turned violent in California.And also, recently, I spoke to the parents of a transgender girl in Texas who told me that they're afraid and that they are considering leaving not just their State, but the country.Sir, why do you think this is happening? And what do you say to parents, like the ones that I spoke to, to those families who are contemplating leaving the country because they don't feel safe anymore?And then, Prime\u2014Prime Minister Sunak, thank you. You mentioned that AI has been a key part of your visit. What are the U.S. and the U.K.\u2014what is the U.K. doing with the U.S. to protect elections and democracy from AI-generated disinformation campaigns waged at scale by foreign actors?And you also mentioned the warning letter sent by AI leaders about the potential threat that this technology, if misused, can pose to humanity. How is regulating artificial intelligence going to be any different than what has been done at the global scale, so far, to deal with climate change, another existential threat?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nLet me answer your first question. First of all, maybe quietly, when we finish this, you can give me the number of that family, and I will call them and let them know that the President and this administration has their back. And I mean that.Look, as President, I was proud to end the ban on transgender troops in our military, sign the Respect for Marriage Act, strengthen the civil rights protections for LBGT Americans, and advance LGBT human rights around the globe.But our fight is far, far from over because we have some hysterical and, I would argue, prejudiced people who are engaged in all of what you see going on around the country. It's an appeal to fear, and it's an appeal that is totally, thoroughly unjustified and ugly.It's wrong for\u2014that a person can be married in the morning in the United States and fired in the afternoon by their employer because they are\u2014they're gay. It's wrong that the violence and hate crimes targeting LGBTQ people is rising. It's wrong that extreme officials are pushing hateful bills targeting transgender children, terrifying families, and criminalizing doctors.These are our kids. These are our neighbors. It's cruel and it's callous. Not somebody else's kids; they're all our kids. They're the kids\u2014and our children are the kite strings that hold our national ambitions aloft. It matters a great deal how we treat everyone in this country.And the fact is that I'm announcing today a series of new initiatives that we're taking to protect the LGBT community. I was going to do this at the fore out on South Lawn. We're having Pride Day, but we're going to have to postpone it because of the climate, because of the weather and the pollution out there because of the fires.But number one, we're going to strengthen the physical safety, dedicated resources, the Federal coordination to better protect Pride celebrations, marches, community centers, health care providers, and small businesses.Secondly, we're addressing civil rights violations, a new coordinator to protect LGBT students from book bans, which make it harder for kids to learn and may violate their civil rights at the same time.We're also engaging in mental health and other supports, more mental health resources and funding to help families support their kids, new efforts to protect LGBTQ kids in foster care, and steps to end\u2014the absolute end of LGBTQ homelessness.Congress has to pass\u2014and I'm not giving up on this. Just like they told me we couldn't get Marriage Act passed. Congress must pass\u2014must pass\u2014the Equality Act and send it to my desk.LGBTQ Americans, especially children: You're loved, you're heard, and this administration has your back, and I mean it. We are not relenting one single second to make sure that they're protected. Laura, the\u2014on your question, it's clear that AI can bring incredible and will bring incredible benefits to society, our economies, to all of us. And actually, one of your leading venture capitalists just published an essay on this, which made the point very eloquently yesterday.And it's also clear, though, that it does pose very real risks that we, as leaders, need to be cognizant of and put in place the guardrails to mitigate against.Actually, President Biden and I had a very good conversation on this just a couple of weeks ago in Japan in one of our sessions in Hiroshima. And we are aligned in wanting to discuss with other countries what those guardrails should be.I think here in the U.S., you've convened all the companies together recently; we've done the same in Downing Street just a couple of weeks ago. And I think there are a series of measures that we can implement working cooperatively, as we have been discussing, that will ensure that we can enjoy the benefits of this technology whilst mitigating against their risks. And that's what our citizens would expect.And you talk about climate change. You know, we come together at COP to work multilaterally across multiple countries to bring down carbon emissions, to get funding to the countries that need it, to share research on how we can develop the green technologies of the future. Indeed, that's part of our conversations and agreement today.And we need to bring that same spirit of urgency, I think, to the challenges and opportunities that AI poses, because the pace of the technological change is faster than people had anticipated. And I think the letter that you mentioned kind of reminded us that we do need to work urgently to address this issue. And I'm delighted that Joe and I and others will be doing that with all great haste.And I think a couple of questions on our end.

[Laughter] Yes, they're holding on to it.Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez with the PBS NewsHour. All over the country, Mr. President, Republican-led States are passing laws\u2014passing anti-LGBTQ, antitransgender laws that restrict rights and medical care. Intimidation is on the rise. This week, anti-LGBTQ protesters turned violent in California.And also, recently, I spoke to the parents of a transgender girl in Texas who told me that they're afraid and that they are considering leaving not just their State, but the country.Sir, why do you think this is happening? And what do you say to parents, like the ones that I spoke to, to those families who are contemplating leaving the country because they don't feel safe anymore?And then, Prime\u2014Prime Minister Sunak, thank you. You mentioned that AI has been a key part of your visit. What are the U.S. and the U.K.\u2014what is the U.K. doing with the U.S. to protect elections and democracy from AI-generated disinformation campaigns waged at scale by foreign actors?And you also mentioned the warning letter sent by AI leaders about the potential threat that this technology, if misused, can pose to humanity. How is regulating artificial intelligence going to be any different than what has been done at the global scale, so far, to deal with climate change, another existential threat?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nLet me answer your first question. First of all, maybe quietly, when we finish this, you can give me the number of that family, and I will call them and let them know that the President and this administration has their back. And I mean that.Look, as President, I was proud to end the ban on transgender troops in our military, sign the Respect for Marriage Act, strengthen the civil rights protections for LBGT Americans, and advance LGBT human rights around the globe.But our fight is far, far from over because we have some hysterical and, I would argue, prejudiced people who are engaged in all of what you see going on around the country. It's an appeal to fear, and it's an appeal that is totally, thoroughly unjustified and ugly.It's wrong for\u2014that a person can be married in the morning in the United States and fired in the afternoon by their employer because they are\u2014they're gay. It's wrong that the violence and hate crimes targeting LGBTQ people is rising. It's wrong that extreme officials are pushing hateful bills targeting transgender children, terrifying families, and criminalizing doctors.These are our kids. These are our neighbors. It's cruel and it's callous. Not somebody else's kids; they're all our kids. They're the kids\u2014and our children are the kite strings that hold our national ambitions aloft. It matters a great deal how we treat everyone in this country.And the fact is that I'm announcing today a series of new initiatives that we're taking to protect the LGBT community. I was going to do this at the fore out on South Lawn. We're having Pride Day, but we're going to have to postpone it because of the climate, because of the weather and the pollution out there because of the fires.But number one, we're going to strengthen the physical safety, dedicated resources, the Federal coordination to better protect Pride celebrations, marches, community centers, health care providers, and small businesses.Secondly, we're addressing civil rights violations, a new coordinator to protect LGBT students from book bans, which make it harder for kids to learn and may violate their civil rights at the same time.We're also engaging in mental health and other supports, more mental health resources and funding to help families support their kids, new efforts to protect LGBTQ kids in foster care, and steps to end\u2014the absolute end of LGBTQ homelessness.Congress has to pass\u2014and I'm not giving up on this. Just like they told me we couldn't get Marriage Act passed. Congress must pass\u2014must pass\u2014the Equality Act and send it to my desk.LGBTQ Americans, especially children: You're loved, you're heard, and this administration has your back, and I mean it. We are not relenting one single second to make sure that they're protected. Laura, the\u2014on your question, it's clear that AI can bring incredible and will bring incredible benefits to society, our economies, to all of us. And actually, one of your leading venture capitalists just published an essay on this, which made the point very eloquently yesterday.And it's also clear, though, that it does pose very real risks that we, as leaders, need to be cognizant of and put in place the guardrails to mitigate against.Actually, President Biden and I had a very good conversation on this just a couple of weeks ago in Japan in one of our sessions in Hiroshima. And we are aligned in wanting to discuss with other countries what those guardrails should be.I think here in the U.S., you've convened all the companies together recently; we've done the same in Downing Street just a couple of weeks ago. And I think there are a series of measures that we can implement working cooperatively, as we have been discussing, that will ensure that we can enjoy the benefits of this technology whilst mitigating against their risks. And that's what our citizens would expect.And you talk about climate change. You know, we come together at COP to work multilaterally across multiple countries to bring down carbon emissions, to get funding to the countries that need it, to share research on how we can develop the green technologies of the future. Indeed, that's part of our conversations and agreement today.And we need to bring that same spirit of urgency, I think, to the challenges and opportunities that AI poses, because the pace of the technological change is faster than people had anticipated. And I think the letter that you mentioned kind of reminded us that we do need to work urgently to address this issue. And I'm delighted that Joe and I and others will be doing that with all great haste.And I think a couple of questions on our end. Could I call on the BBC?\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nRegulation of artificial intelligence and how it differs from global efforts to address climate change.\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

It was about: Is the new Washington consensus that you and your National Security Adviser set out simply another way of saying America first, which some overseas think it is?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, look, my economic policy is totally consistent with what I think is in the interest of our NATO allies and our allies around the world.One of the things that I decided to do\u2014and I find that the Wall Street Journal\u2014and I'm sure there is someone here from the Wall Street Journal and other publications that are talking about Bidenomics. I didn't realize it was\u2014I had Bidenomics going.But the bottom line was this: that the fundamental changes taking place in terms of international trade, nobody in\u2014at least very few people in United States, and I suspect around the world, knew what a supply chain meant, what they're talking about, the supply chain.When we found out during the pandemic that the reason why we couldn't build automobiles was because the outfit that we got our semiconductors from in Southeast Asia had shut down because of the pandemic, we realized that\u2014I decided that no longer would we rely on one center of support for any of the things that are needed for our economic growth.And I made it clear to all our NATO allies and our partners as well that although we were going to generate a\u2014for example, an AI capacity here\u2014I mean, excuse me, a semiconductor capacity here in the United States, attracting literally several hundred billion dollars in investment, that that was available to all of our allies, all of our friends. And they're investing as they\u2014as we are and benefiting in a similar way.The bottom line here for me is that I think that the world is changing in a way that globalization is still real. But the measure of what we used to call in the United States trickle-down economics, where if the\u2014if the trickle-down economics resulted in both\u2014in Democratic and Republican administrations for generations\u2014in making sure we found the cheapest labor in the world, sent the product to\u2014sent the work to those\u2014to that neighbor or those neighbors who have the cheapest labor, and they send back their products.Well, I'm not doing that anymore. We're going to make sure that we, in fact, have a flip of that. We're sending capacity\u2014here in the United States, we're attracting capacity to build here in the United States to send product overseas, not the reverse.And I know it sounds simplistic, but it's working so far. And it's not going to hurt any of our allies or friends in terms of the trade piece of this. Matter of fact, I'm finding they're benefiting from it as well, because they're engaging in it with us. And at home, they're doing similar things.So that's why we talked about the need to have relationships in terms of certain materials\u2014the battery technologies\u2014to share. We rely on Great Britain to produce a lot of that for us.So it is increasing trade. But right now it looks like it is\u2014because the United States is doing so incredibly well, it makes it looks like it's only the United States. It's not. It's just a change in direction in terms of how we view generating economic growth. And just to add to that, I'd say I'm absolutely of the view that the United States, this President does not believe in zero-sum competition amongst allies. That's what we declared together with our G-7 partners just a few weeks ago in Hiroshima. This is a President and an administration that is completely attuned to the needs and concerns of its allies on these issues. And you can see that.Today, as the President said, we are launching negotiations between the U.K. and the U.S. on a critical minerals agreement so that the U.S. can provide us with that interaction and cooperation we need.And the Atlantic Declaration that we've announced today just talks about strengthening, deepening our cooperation. It's not about looking in and being protection; it's about the exact opposite of that.And it's about strengthening that cooperation across the full spectrum of economic, technological, and other spheres. And that's what you will see. You'll see that from the President. You'll see it from me. You'll see the U.K. and the U.S. working even more closely together on all the big economic issues of our time, because that's what the moment demands, and that's what our citizens need us to do. And that's what the President and I plan to deliver. And it's not just our citizens. Look, the Global South\u2014there are going to be a billion people in Africa very shortly. One billion.At the G-7, it was originally called Build Back Better World, but we were talking about\u2014there's a new PPI [PGII; White House correction]\u2014anyway\u2014an industrial policy that we're all signed on to, to provide the countries in Africa and in the Global South an opportunity to grow, significantly grow, which benefits the United States, benefits Europe, benefits every country.Because the reverse is true: If we don't figure a way in which these countries can grow and participate and have to\u2014and be able to build infrastructure\u2014you know, the Canadians\u2014the\u2014excuse me, the Chinese have a Belt and Road Initiative. Well, the Belt and Road Initiative turns out to be a debt and confiscation program. Not going very far.But what we're doing\u2014and we're going to be doing with our NATO allies, with the G-7\u2014is providing opportunities. For example, Angola\u2014I\u2014should be in a position very soon to have the largest solar facility in the world, generating significant amounts of energy. It benefits us, benefits them, brings them into the 21st century in a way that they'd never been before.We're talking about building\u2014and I had my team putting together with other countries as well\u2014to build a railroad from the Pacific Ocean\u2014from the Atlantic Ocean all the way to the Indian Ocean. Never occurred before. How\u2014we're\u2014our Departments of Agriculture are working with these countries.So there's a significant amount of cooperation, not to hoard capacity, but to expand capacity to further expand opportunity, because we all benefit from it.And one thing I've learned is that we are not going to be able to deal with the global warming, which is a consequential\u2014single most consequential threat to humanity if we don't do it, unless we engage more together, not fewer\u2014not less together.And so the United States will do what it can do well and invite all of our partners to be part of it if we can.Thank you. Thank you.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nIs the new Washington consensus that you and your National Security Adviser set out simply another way of saying America first, which some overseas think it is?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, Mr. President. You spoke a moment ago about what you won't do in terms of your negotiations with Republicans. But I'm interested in what you've signaled you already might do. In particular, by conceding in these negotiations to some form of a cap or freezing spending, are you concerned that Mr. McCarthy has already forced you into accepting a policy position that could tip this economy into a recession?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNo, I don't believe that's the case at all. As a matter of fact, I think that we can reach an agreement. As I've told you\u2014and you may be aware or you've seen it\u2014we have provided for a proposal that would cut a trillion dollars off the baseline spent from the year before by just agreeing to deal with what was initially offered.And secondly, we're in a situation where the\u2014let me put it this way: If you all were doing your budget at home, and you said, Okay, we have to make some cuts, would you only look at the spending or would you also look at your income\u2014what was coming in the door\u2014to determine what you could afford?And so part of what I've been arguing from the beginning is a need to consider the tax structure as well as\u2014as well as\u2014cutting spending. I'm willing to cut spending, and I proposed cuts in spending of over a trillion dollars.But I believe we have to also look at the tax revenues. The idea that the\u2014my Republican colleagues want to continue the $2 trillion tax cut that had profound negative impacts on the economy from the Trump administration. The fact that they are\u2014we've provided for the number of\u2014we got a lot of input from serious economists and former administration officials in both parties that we need more people who are qualified to be able to look at the tax returns of the thousand billionaires in America\u2014very complicated stuff.It's estimated that if we had the appropriate number of tax personnel, that we would save somewhere between\u2014we would generate somewhere between $200 billion and $400 billion in tax revenue.And there's a lot of other\u2014for example, the idea that we're\u2014in terms of taxes\u2014that they refuse to\u2014for example, we\u2014I was able to balance the budget and pass everything from the global warming bill\u2014anyway, I was able to cut, by $1.7 billion [trillion; White House correction] in the first 2 years, the deficit that we were accumulating.And\u2014because I was able to say, too, that the 55 corporations in America that made forty\u2014$400 billion\u2014or $40 billion\u2014$400 billion\u2014that they\u2014they pay zero in tax. Zero. And so we said, You've got to pay a minimum of 15 percent taxes. What a horrible thing. You're paying more than 15 percent in taxes, every one of you out there.And so guess what? We not only balanced the budget; we were able to reduce the deficit by $1.7 billion [trillion; White House correction]. And so there's a lot of things that they refuse to look at in terms of tax generation as well as what kind of people we're going to increase taxes for.And like I said, we're now down to\u2014we went from somewhere\u2014roughly 740 billionaires to about 1,000 billionaires in America. They're paying an average tax rate of 8 percent. Raise your hand if you want to pay 8 percent only. I think you'd all be ready to do that.So my point is that there's a lot of things that they refuse to entertain, and they just said revenue is off the table. Well, revenue is not off the table. And so that's what I continue\u2014we continue to have a significant disagreement on, on the revenue side.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nConcern about accepting a cap or freezing spending and its impact on the economy.\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

But you don't think the spending cuts themselves will cause a recession?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI know they won't. I know they won't.Matter of fact, the fact that we were able to cut Government spending by $1.7 trillion, that didn't cause a recession; that caused growth. Look, we have the lowest unemployment rate in over 50 years. We've created 12-point\u2014I think it's\u20147 million new jobs, including 800,000 manufacturing jobs. We have moved in a direction where we're rebuilding and reconstructing America through the infrastructure act.Look, here's the other thing. I'm sure\u2014I'm not sure; my guess is, I'll get a question about, you know, Well, wait a minute, you know, the American people aren't satisfied. Well, guess what? As I've told you all before, most of this\u2014what we've passed\u2014doesn't kick in\u2014it only kicks in over time. And so the fact is, for example, that if you're in a situation where you were\u2014I'll give you the one example that I've used\u2014everybody understands the easiest\u2014is insulin.Well, I decided that we were going to be in a position where we were not going to continue to pay the highest drug prices in the world. And that's what we do, by the way. Same manufacturer of a drug in the United States, selling it here in Japan, selling it in Tokyo, or selling it in Berlin, or selling it around the world, they pay a lot less than we pay at home.So we said a simple proposition: Let's take a look at how much it costs to make the product. And I'm not going to ask you to\u2014a show of hands like I do in a town meeting, but if\u2014I usually ask, How many people know somebody who has type 1 or type 2 diabetes? And I'm almost\u2014at least half the audience raises their hand.Well, they were paying somewhere between $4- and $700 a month for their insulin that they badly need to stay healthy and alive. Well, guess what? It costs $10\u2014t-e-n\u2014$10 to make. To package, total amount, you could argue maybe as much as $13.Well, guess what? Now they can't charge more for\u2014Medicare can't, because Medicare is paying\u2014taking American tax dollars and paying for the elderly's health care needs. You can't charge more than $35 for that drug. That saves $160 billion. Hear it? A hundred and sixty billion dollars less will be paid out by the Federal\u2014by the American taxpayer to help the elderly people on Medicare with a problem.Well, a lot of this is just kicking in. We're in a situation where next year, for the drug costs, no senior will have to pay\u2014total cost\u2014total cost of all the drugs, from expensive cancer drugs to whatever drugs they're taking, will not have to pay more than $3,500 a year. The following year\u2014we've already passed this. This is the law now. The following year, they won't have to pay more than $2,000. That saves another $200 billion that we're paying out.But the other team won't count this. Even though it's the law\u2014we passed it\u2014they won't count that as reducing the debt.So there's a lot of those kinds of disagreements we have. And my guess is that I'm going to be talking to the Speaker of the House on the way back on the plane, because it will be morning time over\u2014at home. And I'm going to be in that plane in about an hour or so. And my guess is, he's going to want to deal directly with me in making sure we're all on the same page.But it's probably more than you wanted to know.How about Masaru, NHK [Masaru Takagi; NHK World].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nBut you don't think the spending cuts themselves will cause a recession?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, Mr. President. You recently launched your reelection campaign. You've said questions about your age are legitimate. And your response is always, Just watch me. But the country is watching, and recent polling shows that 70 percent of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, believe you shouldn't run again. What do you say to them? What do you say to those Americans who are watching and aren't convinced?You've said you can beat Trump again. Do you think you're the only one?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI may not be the only one, but I know him well. And I know the danger he presents to our democracy. And we've been down this road before.And with regard to age, you know, and polling data, I noticed the polling data I keep hearing about is that I'm between 42 and 46 percent favorable rating, et cetera. And\u2014but everybody running for reelection in this time has been in the same position. There's nothing new about that. You're making it sound like Biden is really underwater. And\u2014number one.Number two, when the same polling data asks whether they think\u2014what kind of job I've done, it gets overwhelmingly positive results, from 58 percent thinking everything from the CHIPS Act and the\u2014all the things we've done.You know, we've created\u2014like I said, we've created 12 million new jobs. We've created 800,000 manufacturing jobs. We have economic growth moving. We're in a situation where the climate\u2014we've invested more money and more help in dealing with the climate crisis than any nation in the world.And so, things are moving. And the reason I'm running again is there's a job to finish.The other thing is that\u2014look, you know, think about what I inherited when I got elected. I inherited a nation in overwhelming debt at the time, number one\u2014in the hole for the 4 years that he was President.I inherited a nation that had a serious loss of credibility around the world as America First and\u2014\u2014You know, the first meeting I attended\u2014the G-7\u2014I said, American is back. And one of the world leaders looked and said: For how long? For how long? There was a great concern about the United States being able to lead the free world. And we're doing that again.And those same polls you look at\u2014you take a look at the polls that are saying whether I pulled together NATO and the European Union, as well as the Asian partners. I think we have. But there's more to do.And with regard to age, I can't even say\u2014if I guess how old I am, I can't even say the number. It doesn't\u2014it doesn't register with me.And\u2014but the only thing I can say is that one of the things that people are going to find out\u2014they're going to see a race, and they're going to judge whether or not I have it or don't have it. I respect them taking a hard look at it. I'd take a hard look at it as well. I took a hard look at it before I decided to run.And I feel good. I feel excited about the prospects. And I think we're on the verge of really turning the corner in a way we haven't in a long time.I know you're tired of hearing me say we're at an inflection point, but we really are. What happens in the next 2, 3, 4 years is going to determine what the next three or four decades look like. And I have never been more optimistic in my life about the possibilities of the United States.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat do you say to those Americans who are watching and aren't convinced?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

I inherited a nation in overwhelming debt at the time, number one\u2014in the hole for the 4 years that he was President.I inherited a nation that had a serious loss of credibility around the world as America First and\u2014\u2014You know, the first meeting I attended\u2014the G-7\u2014I said, American is back. And one of the world leaders looked and said: For how long? For how long? There was a great concern about the United States being able to lead the free world. And we're doing that again.And those same polls you look at\u2014you take a look at the polls that are saying whether I pulled together NATO and the European Union, as well as the Asian partners. I think we have. But there's more to do.And with regard to age, I can't even say\u2014if I guess how old I am, I can't even say the number. It doesn't\u2014it doesn't register with me.And\u2014but the only thing I can say is that one of the things that people are going to find out\u2014they're going to see a race, and they're going to judge whether or not I have it or don't have it. I respect them taking a hard look at it. I'd take a hard look at it as well. I took a hard look at it before I decided to run.And I feel good. I feel excited about the prospects. And I think we're on the verge of really turning the corner in a way we haven't in a long time.I know you're tired of hearing me say we're at an inflection point, but we really are. What happens in the next 2, 3, 4 years is going to determine what the next three or four decades look like. And I have never been more optimistic in my life about the possibilities of the United States.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nYou've said you can beat Trump again.

I'm from Financial News. My name is Kim\u2014[inaudible]. My question goes to both of you. My first one goes to President Yoon first.During the state visit, you've said that the alliance has strengthened to cutting-edge industries, to cutting-edge science. And also investments in businesses have been some of the outcomes. These are some positives. However, to each individual of the public, how will this have a long-term impact? What will be the direct benefits felt?And to President Biden: In celebration of the 70th anniversary of the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance, I know that the atmosphere is really positive. However, Korean businesses, especially because of the CHIPS Act and the IRA, are on edge.What message can you send to the Korean companies to really make sure and tell them that this is not something to worry about?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThe technology cooperation between the R.O.K. and the U.S., and also in partnerships in cutting-edge industries, in science and technology, was your first question. So that is about really strengthening the competitiveness of our two countries. And it will enhance the productivity and create added value\u2014high added value. These are the types of products that are going to be produced.And from the perspective of the public, for each individual: In that process, they will reap the benefits wide and comprehensive that will stem from these industries and investments in these industries\u2014for example, from job creation, as well.And above all, the future generations will be given the determination and will to take on new challenges and embrace opportunities in our industry so that they can continue to prosper and grow and become more abundant in the future. The reassurance is that it's overwhelmingly in our interests for Korea to do well. No, it is. It's very much in America's interest that Korea do well in the Pacific\u2014very well\u2014because they are one of our most valued partners.And so I think the combination of growing democracies and the democratic institutions, as well as their economies, is overwhelmingly in the benefit of the United States, whether it is in South Korea or it's in Australia, in the deep South Pacific.And so I think that there's a reason\u2014overwhelming reason.Plus, in addition to that, we're increasing the number of student exchanges, access to more information between our folks, educating our people, as well as we're going to be cooperating on everything from space to technology to medicine. And so there's so many opportunities we have.And I don't think we\u2014at least we don't\u2014and I don't think, so far, most of the South Korean companies believe that there's somehow a U.S. effort to slow them down, prevent their growth, or anything like that. We'd like to see them grow. And I mean that sincerely.It's overwhelmingly in the U.S. interest for South Korea to do very well economically. It's overwhelmingly in our interest because it has\u2014\u2014And lastly, you know, I think we underestimate the example that South Korea sets. Here you have a nation that is significant, but is not a nation of 2-, 3-, 400,000 people, making the kind of changes it's making.It gives other smaller nations hope to believe that if they have democratic institutions and commitment and impact on industries that in fact are the cutting-edge industries\u2014new sciences and technology, including AI and other things\u2014that there's a future for them. And I think that's what this is about.And so we view South Korea's economic growth as a benefit to the United States, as well as freedom around the world.Thank you all so very much.

Good afternoon, Mr. President. Good afternoon, Mr. Prime Minister. I'd like to ask a question about Roxham Road. The agreement has been ready for a year. Why did you wait so long?And for the 15,000 migrants that Canada will welcome, why so few? What have we offered to the U.S. in exchange?Prime Minister Trudeau. Thank you, Christian. We've known for a long time theoretically what modernization needed to be made to the Roxham Road, to the agreement. We couldn't simply shut down Roxham Road and hope that everything would resolve itself, because we would have had problems. The border is very long. People would have looked for other places to cross.And so that's why we chose to modernize the Safe Third Country Agreement so that someone who attempts to cross between official crossings will be subject to the principle\u2014the same principle as someone who should seek asylum in the first safe country they arrive at.Now, for people who are coming from the U.S., that is where they should be asylum seekers, using this means of uniformly applying the agreement, which we knew theoretically would be the solution, but it takes complex processes to manage the border. It took months before we could move forward with the announcement. But by doing so, we protected the integrity of the system. And we're also continuing to live up to our obligations with respect to asylum seekers.At the same time, we continue to be open to regular migrants, and we will increase the number of asylum seekers who we accept from the hemisphere\u2014the Western Hemisphere\u2014in order to compensate for closing these irregular crossings.Thank you.Haiti [The reporter spoke in English as follows.] Q. Mr. President, this question is for you, but Mr. Trudeau\u2014\u2014[The reporter continued in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]Please feel free, Mr. Trudeau, to answer as well.Are you disappointed that Canada is not part or hasn't taken a bigger role in the multilateral forces in Haiti? And what would you like Canada to do more, in addition to the $100 million announced today?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, no, I'm not disappointed. Look, this is a very, very difficult circumstance, the idea of how do we deal with what's going on in , where gangs have essentially taken the place of the Government, in effect. They run\u2014they rule the roost, as the saying goes.And so I think that what the Prime Minister has spoken about makes a lot of sense. The biggest thing we could do, and it's going to take time, is to increase the prospect of the police departments in having the capacity to deal with the problems that are faced. And that is going to take a little bit of time.We also are looking at whether or not the international community, through the United Nations, could play a larger role in this event, in this circumstance. But there is no question that there is a real, genuine concern, because there are several million people in , and the diaspora could cause some real\u2014how can I say it?\u2014confusion in the Western Hemisphere.And so\u2014but I think that what the Prime Minister is suggesting, and we are as well going to be contributing, to see if we can both increase the efficiency and capacity of the training and the methods used by the police department, as well as seeing if we can engage other people in the hemisphere, which we've been talking to, and they're prepared to do some. So it's a work in progress.[] For 30 years, Western countries have been involved in to try to stabilize the country, to try to help the Pearl of the Antilles. And the situation is atrocious. It's affecting the security of the people of . We must take action.And we must keep the an people in the approach that we build for security. And that's why the approach that we are working on with the U.S. involves strengthening the capacity of the an National Police, bringing more peace and security and stability. This won't happen tomorrow. It will, of course, be a long process, but we will be there to support the capacity of the police in , the National Police.At the same time, part of the insecurity and instability in is because of the an elite, who have for too long benefited from the misery of the an people.

Good afternoon, Mr. President. Good afternoon, Mr. Prime Minister. I'd like to ask a question about Roxham Road. The agreement has been ready for a year. Why did you wait so long?And for the 15,000 migrants that Canada will welcome, why so few? What have we offered to the U.S. in exchange?Prime Minister Trudeau. Thank you, Christian. We've known for a long time theoretically what modernization needed to be made to the Roxham Road, to the agreement. We couldn't simply shut down Roxham Road and hope that everything would resolve itself, because we would have had problems. The border is very long. People would have looked for other places to cross.And so that's why we chose to modernize the Safe Third Country Agreement so that someone who attempts to cross between official crossings will be subject to the principle\u2014the same principle as someone who should seek asylum in the first safe country they arrive at.Now, for people who are coming from the U.S., that is where they should be asylum seekers, using this means of uniformly applying the agreement, which we knew theoretically would be the solution, but it takes complex processes to manage the border. It took months before we could move forward with the announcement. But by doing so, we protected the integrity of the system. And we're also continuing to live up to our obligations with respect to asylum seekers.At the same time, we continue to be open to regular migrants, and we will increase the number of asylum seekers who we accept from the hemisphere\u2014the Western Hemisphere\u2014in order to compensate for closing these irregular crossings.Thank you.Haiti [The reporter spoke in English as follows.] Q. Mr. President, this question is for you, but Mr. Trudeau\u2014\u2014[The reporter continued in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]Please feel free, Mr. Trudeau, to answer as well.Are you disappointed that Canada is not part or hasn't taken a bigger role in the multilateral forces in Haiti? And what would you like Canada to do more, in addition to the $100 million announced today?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, no, I'm not disappointed. Look, this is a very, very difficult circumstance, the idea of how do we deal with what's going on in , where gangs have essentially taken the place of the Government, in effect. They run\u2014they rule the roost, as the saying goes.And so I think that what the Prime Minister has spoken about makes a lot of sense. The biggest thing we could do, and it's going to take time, is to increase the prospect of the police departments in having the capacity to deal with the problems that are faced. And that is going to take a little bit of time.We also are looking at whether or not the international community, through the United Nations, could play a larger role in this event, in this circumstance. But there is no question that there is a real, genuine concern, because there are several million people in , and the diaspora could cause some real\u2014how can I say it?\u2014confusion in the Western Hemisphere.And so\u2014but I think that what the Prime Minister is suggesting, and we are as well going to be contributing, to see if we can both increase the efficiency and capacity of the training and the methods used by the police department, as well as seeing if we can engage other people in the hemisphere, which we've been talking to, and they're prepared to do some. So it's a work in progress.[] For 30 years, Western countries have been involved in to try to stabilize the country, to try to help the Pearl of the Antilles. And the situation is atrocious. It's affecting the security of the people of . We must take action.And we must keep the an people in the approach that we build for security. And that's why the approach that we are working on with the U.S. involves strengthening the capacity of the an National Police, bringing more peace and security and stability. This won't happen tomorrow. It will, of course, be a long process, but we will be there to support the capacity of the police in , the National Police.At the same time, part of the insecurity and instability in is because of the an elite, who have for too long benefited from the misery of the an people. They work for their own political gain, their own personal gain. And this has prevented the country from recovering. And that's why we're proceeding with sanctions.

Thank you, Mr. President. Some on Wall Street have expressed frustration that it's unclear what more your administration is willing to do to resolve the banking crisis.

Number one.Look, I think we've done a pretty damn good job. People's savings are secure, and even those beyond the $250,000 the FDIC is guaranteeing them. And the American taxpayer is not going to have to pay a penny. The banks are in pretty good shape. What's going on in Europe isn't a direct consequence of what's happening in the United States.And I\u2014what we would do is, if we find that there's more instability than appears, we'd be in a position to have the FDIC use the power it has to guarantee those loans above 250, like they did already.And so I think it's going to take a little while for things to just calm down. But I don't see anything that's on the horizon that's about to explode. But I do understand there's an unease about this. And these mid-sized banks have to be able to survive, and I think they'll be able to do that.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow confident are you that the problem is contained?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

[Inaudible][Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]Prime Minister Trudeau. Briefly, in French: In regard to Haiti, Canada has always been there to help the Haitian people, and we are working with our partners in the region to guarantee better solutions for the Haitian people. We have laid sanctions against the elites. We are helping the National Police in Haiti.We have had good exchanges, good dialogues with our partners in the U.S. and Caribbean countries to guarantee that we will be able to preserve and to have the people of Haiti at the center of the solutions.In regard to the economic integration and the competitiveness in North America, be it electric vehicles, be it Critical Minerals Strategy minerals, and the ones we're going to develop to produce the necessary technologies or in regard to any other technologies in order to work together, because we know that North America can offer many solutions, great competitiveness to the rest of the world, and we are a true force to reckon with in our continent.Moderator. Sara Pablo of the Formula Group will pose a question to the constitutional President of the United Mexican States. Q. Yes. Good afternoon, Presidents, Prime Minister. And we have a few questions for President Biden.I know that recently you announced the United States will be receiving citizens from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba, and Nicaragua. What is the timeframe? And are you thinking of expanding the number of people you will be receiving? And is this\u2014some other nations could be included? And what is the amount in technological improvements in the United States?And for President L\u00f3pez Obrador: How will Mexico be prepared to receive all the migrants the United States will be expelling from its territory? And the new migration center in the southern part of Mexico, what is it all about?And then, after this 10th summit, are we going to be seeing changes in migration policies in the way migrants are being treated?And finally, let me\u2014this is for President Biden: fentanyl. What concrete actions are you going to be implementing? What's the impact of the detention of Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n? Because the Cartel of the Pacific is one of the main fentanyl producers.And finally, another question on energy sector consultations. President Biden, Prime Minister Trudeau, did you discuss those discussions about the USMCA, the T-MEC?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nVery well. We did speak about migration in a very broad manner. Of course, there is cooperation with the U.S. administration. And at the same time, we have a commitment to protect migrants.What President Biden has proposed is absolutely true. If migrants cross our country\u2014and, in some cases, they also go through other countries in Latin America\u2014to arrive in the United States, migrants are facing so many risks when they do that, starting with the fact that they are victims of the trafficants\u2014the smugglers\u2014the human traffickers known as the or . And they charge migrants a high amount of money to take them northbound.Now, those or have networks. And at the same time, they hire trailers, trucks\u2014truck trailers. The box of the trailer, they can transport up to 300, 400 people. So the\u2014constant accidents are taking place on the highways of Mexico, the roads of Mexico, unfortunately.And the worst of it all is that many migrants are being kidnapped by criminal groups, by criminals. They're being murdered. And this is very sad, very painful.That's why I'm speaking about protection. We\u2014what we want is an in-depth solution. We've always said that people\u2014just as President Biden said, people do not leave their towns, their countries, their families because they like to do it. This is not a pleasure for them. They do it because of the needs they have. This is a necessity.We've always said we have to look at the root causes of all this. We have to try for people to be able to work and be happy where they were born, where their relatives, their customs, their traditions, their cultures are. And we need to invest for that. We need to invest in development of the countries with more inequality and poverty, because migration has to be an optional thing, not a forced situation.However, in the meantime\u2014because we're, of course, doing everything we can to accomplish this\u2014Mexico, with just a few resources, is helping. I have already mentioned that we are working\u2014we are working with communities in El Salvador, in Honduras. We're going to be starting this in Guatemala and Belize as well.However, we do need to promote development even more\u2014and well-being\u2014to ensure, guarantee opportunities for those that are forced to migrate and leave their communities.We are not thinking of building any center in the southeastern part of Mexico\u2014any migration center. We're not thinking of that. What we do is help with shelters, with health care services, with food services as well. That's the way we help migrants.And we do celebrate the fact that the U.S. administration has taken\u2014made the decision, rather, to have an orderly migration flow in the case, for instance, of our Venezuelan brothers and sisters. And I understand that this plan will also be extended\u2014will be expanded to benefit other migrants, other countries.We know for sure that since the announcement was made saying that those permits, humanitarian visas were going to be granted in the case, for instance, of the Venezuelan population, we've seen a decrease in migration flows, or people crossing Mexico to migrate.This has been a considerable reduction because this was announced in the United States, and this was made public everywhere, saying that 24,000 humanitarian visas or permits were going to be granted and that the formalities had to be covered, the paperwork. Although there are some requirements that have to be met, people decided to do it. So what happened was that a new path has been opened; it didn't exist before.Everything was arriving in the United States, risking everything\u2014risking people's lives, of course, at the risk of their own lives. Now that this mechanism has been approved, people can file their own request. And this might take time. However, there's hope. A hope that this is\u2014a purpose is going to be accomplished: the purpose of going to the United States to work, to live.We celebrate this, and we think that\u2014I insist what Canada is doing is also the right thing to do.And I was talking about our own experience as well. And you can look at data. It's there for you to look at. Because of circumstances in the past, migration corresponded to the sister countries of Central America that were\u2014those were the main migration flows from Central America\u2014but, for a long time as well, Mexicans migrating who were going to look for a better living standard, who were going to look for a job in the United States.And just imagine: There are 40 million Mexicans in the United States\u201440 million who were born here in Mexico, or they're the children of people who were born in Mexico.Now, what have we been able to accomplish with all the support for well-being? We've reduced the number of Mexican migrants, yes. There are less migrants abandoning Mexico now because there's public investment; because out of 35 million families, 30 million families of Mexican families are now receiving at least a program\u2014a well-being program. And this is a very direct manner of doing this here in Mexico.All the senior citizens, 65 or over, receive a pension. This is a universal program in Mexico. Eleven million of senior citizens in Mexico are getting a pension. Eleven million students of low-income families, of poor families are getting grants. They're getting scholarships. All the boys and girls with disabilities also have their own pension.We have a program for reforestation. It is the most important reforestation program in the world. And we are planting over 1 million hectares of fruit and timber trees. And we are giving jobs to over 400,000 peasants that are growing, planting those trees.So, then, all these programs help so that people may be staying in their own communities, in their towns.We built the Dos Bocas refinery\u201435,000 jobs. We are now building the Mayan train, which is the biggest railroad works in the world because it's 1,554 kilometers\u20141,554 kilometers\u2014in five States of Mexico.All the Maya region\u2014which is one of the most important archaeological zones of the world\u2014well, there, people are working, building this railroad system. About 300,000 people are building the train. So that's really the option. That's the path to follow: development, well-being.And I insist, I repeat: I truly celebrate that the Canadian Government and the U.S. administration, as well, are now attending to the migration problem with this type of approach. It's quite lamentable that there are others\u2014other politicians, other Presidents and public officials who are acting in a very inhuman manner.Right now, in this winter season, for instance, with all due respect\u2014I'm not saying this in a very direct manner, but what I'm saying is that, I mean, one of the Governors of our neighboring country headed a movement to take migrants to New York, to Washington, and just drop them there. This is politicking. This is completely inhuman. This should not be done. Because there are those who forget that we are all migrants.How is it that that great nation, the United States, was developed? With migrants. Thanks to that, so then we have to continue seeking, looking for alternatives. Just as, for instance, also in the case of violence, we have to look into the root causes of violence.And also in the case of our country, youth were never cared for. No services for young people. And the only thing that was done was call them young people who didn't work, who didn't study. This is a discriminatory labeling for youth. They don't study; they don't work. they were called in Mexico. They don't do one thing. They don't do the other thing either.So no one was ever caring for our youth in Mexico. All those young people only had\u2014the only option they had, I mean, was to migrate. And many migrated, acting in a respectful manner, a very responsible fashion. And others as well were trying to make a living because they didn't have any other opportunities. So they made a living in what we call the informal economy, which is, you know, making a living out in the street, no matter what. I mean, whichever way you can make a living without falling into illicit activities. However, unfortunately, many did go into the path of antisocial behaviors.But we didn't really take care of young people in Mexico. However, we now have a program devoted to young people. This program never existed in the past. There are 2.4 million young people who are being hired. They are working, and they're apprentices.What are we doing? We are taking away from them this culture, those seats, the reserves, the stock. We're taking that away from criminal groups. We're taking youth\u2014we don't want our youth to be hooked. We don't want those criminal groups to be taking our youth away. We want to give them opportunities. That's exactly what we're doing in Mexico.And let me conclude also highlighting another difference which is quite important: There is no corruption in the administration, the Government that I represent. There's no impunity either.There's\u2014we have painted this line that is very clear. Crime is one thing, and the authority is a different thing. There is no criminal association or partnership as before.Yes, this is\u2014we're even ashamed to mention this, that\u2014to mention that those who were in charge of guaranteeing or ensuring public security were at the service\u2014in the past\u2014were at the service of criminal organizations. This doesn't happen in Mexico anymore.That's why in this meeting, this summit we just held today, all three governments of the three countries, we have reached agreements to continue working together to get peace\u2014to have peace in all three countries so that we can ensure and guarantee security of our peoples.That's all I wanted to answer to your question, Madam.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow Mexico will be prepared to receive migrants expelled from the United States and the purpose of the new migration center in the southern part of Mexico.\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

That's the path to follow: development, well-being.And I insist, I repeat: I truly celebrate that the Canadian Government and the U.S. administration, as well, are now attending to the migration problem with this type of approach. It's quite lamentable that there are others\u2014other politicians, other Presidents and public officials who are acting in a very inhuman manner.Right now, in this winter season, for instance, with all due respect\u2014I'm not saying this in a very direct manner, but what I'm saying is that, I mean, one of the Governors of our neighboring country headed a movement to take migrants to New York, to Washington, and just drop them there. This is politicking. This is completely inhuman. This should not be done. Because there are those who forget that we are all migrants.How is it that that great nation, the United States, was developed? With migrants. Thanks to that, so then we have to continue seeking, looking for alternatives. Just as, for instance, also in the case of violence, we have to look into the root causes of violence.And also in the case of our country, youth were never cared for. No services for young people. And the only thing that was done was call them young people who didn't work, who didn't study. This is a discriminatory labeling for youth. They don't study; they don't work. they were called in Mexico. They don't do one thing. They don't do the other thing either.So no one was ever caring for our youth in Mexico. All those young people only had\u2014the only option they had, I mean, was to migrate. And many migrated, acting in a respectful manner, a very responsible fashion. And others as well were trying to make a living because they didn't have any other opportunities. So they made a living in what we call the informal economy, which is, you know, making a living out in the street, no matter what. I mean, whichever way you can make a living without falling into illicit activities. However, unfortunately, many did go into the path of antisocial behaviors.But we didn't really take care of young people in Mexico. However, we now have a program devoted to young people. This program never existed in the past. There are 2.4 million young people who are being hired. They are working, and they're apprentices.What are we doing? We are taking away from them this culture, those seats, the reserves, the stock. We're taking that away from criminal groups. We're taking youth\u2014we don't want our youth to be hooked. We don't want those criminal groups to be taking our youth away. We want to give them opportunities. That's exactly what we're doing in Mexico.And let me conclude also highlighting another difference which is quite important: There is no corruption in the administration, the Government that I represent. There's no impunity either.There's\u2014we have painted this line that is very clear. Crime is one thing, and the authority is a different thing. There is no criminal association or partnership as before.Yes, this is\u2014we're even ashamed to mention this, that\u2014to mention that those who were in charge of guaranteeing or ensuring public security were at the service\u2014in the past\u2014were at the service of criminal organizations. This doesn't happen in Mexico anymore.That's why in this meeting, this summit we just held today, all three governments of the three countries, we have reached agreements to continue working together to get peace\u2014to have peace in all three countries so that we can ensure and guarantee security of our peoples.That's all I wanted to answer to your question, Madam.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nConcrete actions and impact of the detention of Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n in relation to fentanyl\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

[Inaudible][Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]Prime Minister Trudeau. Briefly, in French: In regard to Haiti, Canada has always been there to help the Haitian people, and we are working with our partners in the region to guarantee better solutions for the Haitian people. We have laid sanctions against the elites. We are helping the National Police in Haiti.We have had good exchanges, good dialogues with our partners in the U.S. and Caribbean countries to guarantee that we will be able to preserve and to have the people of Haiti at the center of the solutions.In regard to the economic integration and the competitiveness in North America, be it electric vehicles, be it Critical Minerals Strategy minerals, and the ones we're going to develop to produce the necessary technologies or in regard to any other technologies in order to work together, because we know that North America can offer many solutions, great competitiveness to the rest of the world, and we are a true force to reckon with in our continent.Moderator. Sara Pablo of the Formula Group will pose a question to the constitutional President of the United Mexican States. Q. Yes. Good afternoon, Presidents, Prime Minister. And we have a few questions for President Biden.I know that recently you announced the United States will be receiving citizens from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba, and Nicaragua. What is the timeframe? And are you thinking of expanding the number of people you will be receiving? And is this\u2014some other nations could be included? And what is the amount in technological improvements in the United States?And for President L\u00f3pez Obrador: How will Mexico be prepared to receive all the migrants the United States will be expelling from its territory? And the new migration center in the southern part of Mexico, what is it all about?And then, after this 10th summit, are we going to be seeing changes in migration policies in the way migrants are being treated?And finally, let me\u2014this is for President Biden: fentanyl. What concrete actions are you going to be implementing? What's the impact of the detention of Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n? Because the Cartel of the Pacific is one of the main fentanyl producers.And finally, another question on energy sector consultations. President Biden, Prime Minister Trudeau, did you discuss those discussions about the USMCA, the T-MEC?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nVery well. We did speak about migration in a very broad manner. Of course, there is cooperation with the U.S. administration. And at the same time, we have a commitment to protect migrants.What President Biden has proposed is absolutely true. If migrants cross our country\u2014and, in some cases, they also go through other countries in Latin America\u2014to arrive in the United States, migrants are facing so many risks when they do that, starting with the fact that they are victims of the trafficants\u2014the smugglers\u2014the human traffickers known as the or . And they charge migrants a high amount of money to take them northbound.Now, those or have networks. And at the same time, they hire trailers, trucks\u2014truck trailers. The box of the trailer, they can transport up to 300, 400 people. So the\u2014constant accidents are taking place on the highways of Mexico, the roads of Mexico, unfortunately.And the worst of it all is that many migrants are being kidnapped by criminal groups, by criminals. They're being murdered. And this is very sad, very painful.That's why I'm speaking about protection. We\u2014what we want is an in-depth solution. We've always said that people\u2014just as President Biden said, people do not leave their towns, their countries, their families because they like to do it. This is not a pleasure for them. They do it because of the needs they have. This is a necessity.We've always said we have to look at the root causes of all this. We have to try for people to be able to work and be happy where they were born, where their relatives, their customs, their traditions, their cultures are. And we need to invest for that. We need to invest in development of the countries with more inequality and poverty, because migration has to be an optional thing, not a forced situation.However, in the meantime\u2014because we're, of course, doing everything we can to accomplish this\u2014Mexico, with just a few resources, is helping. I have already mentioned that we are working\u2014we are working with communities in El Salvador, in Honduras. We're going to be starting this in Guatemala and Belize as well.However, we do need to promote development even more\u2014and well-being\u2014to ensure, guarantee opportunities for those that are forced to migrate and leave their communities.We are not thinking of building any center in the southeastern part of Mexico\u2014any migration center. We're not thinking of that. What we do is help with shelters, with health care services, with food services as well. That's the way we help migrants.And we do celebrate the fact that the U.S. administration has taken\u2014made the decision, rather, to have an orderly migration flow in the case, for instance, of our Venezuelan brothers and sisters. And I understand that this plan will also be extended\u2014will be expanded to benefit other migrants, other countries.We know for sure that since the announcement was made saying that those permits, humanitarian visas were going to be granted in the case, for instance, of the Venezuelan population, we've seen a decrease in migration flows, or people crossing Mexico to migrate.This has been a considerable reduction because this was announced in the United States, and this was made public everywhere, saying that 24,000 humanitarian visas or permits were going to be granted and that the formalities had to be covered, the paperwork. Although there are some requirements that have to be met, people decided to do it. So what happened was that a new path has been opened; it didn't exist before.Everything was arriving in the United States, risking everything\u2014risking people's lives, of course, at the risk of their own lives. Now that this mechanism has been approved, people can file their own request. And this might take time. However, there's hope. A hope that this is\u2014a purpose is going to be accomplished: the purpose of going to the United States to work, to live.We celebrate this, and we think that\u2014I insist what Canada is doing is also the right thing to do.And I was talking about our own experience as well. And you can look at data. It's there for you to look at. Because of circumstances in the past, migration corresponded to the sister countries of Central America that were\u2014those were the main migration flows from Central America\u2014but, for a long time as well, Mexicans migrating who were going to look for a better living standard, who were going to look for a job in the United States.And just imagine: There are 40 million Mexicans in the United States\u201440 million who were born here in Mexico, or they're the children of people who were born in Mexico.Now, what have we been able to accomplish with all the support for well-being? We've reduced the number of Mexican migrants, yes. There are less migrants abandoning Mexico now because there's public investment; because out of 35 million families, 30 million families of Mexican families are now receiving at least a program\u2014a well-being program. And this is a very direct manner of doing this here in Mexico.All the senior citizens, 65 or over, receive a pension. This is a universal program in Mexico. Eleven million of senior citizens in Mexico are getting a pension. Eleven million students of low-income families, of poor families are getting grants. They're getting scholarships. All the boys and girls with disabilities also have their own pension.We have a program for reforestation. It is the most important reforestation program in the world. And we are planting over 1 million hectares of fruit and timber trees. And we are giving jobs to over 400,000 peasants that are growing, planting those trees.So, then, all these programs help so that people may be staying in their own communities, in their towns.We built the Dos Bocas refinery\u201435,000 jobs. We are now building the Mayan train, which is the biggest railroad works in the world because it's 1,554 kilometers\u20141,554 kilometers\u2014in five States of Mexico.All the Maya region\u2014which is one of the most important archaeological zones of the world\u2014well, there, people are working, building this railroad system.

We have laid sanctions against the elites. We are helping the National Police in Haiti.We have had good exchanges, good dialogues with our partners in the U.S. and Caribbean countries to guarantee that we will be able to preserve and to have the people of Haiti at the center of the solutions.In regard to the economic integration and the competitiveness in North America, be it electric vehicles, be it Critical Minerals Strategy minerals, and the ones we're going to develop to produce the necessary technologies or in regard to any other technologies in order to work together, because we know that North America can offer many solutions, great competitiveness to the rest of the world, and we are a true force to reckon with in our continent.Moderator. Sara Pablo of the Formula Group will pose a question to the constitutional President of the United Mexican States. Q. Yes. Good afternoon, Presidents, Prime Minister. And we have a few questions for President Biden.I know that recently you announced the United States will be receiving citizens from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba, and Nicaragua. What is the timeframe? And are you thinking of expanding the number of people you will be receiving? And is this\u2014some other nations could be included? And what is the amount in technological improvements in the United States?And for President L\u00f3pez Obrador: How will Mexico be prepared to receive all the migrants the United States will be expelling from its territory? And the new migration center in the southern part of Mexico, what is it all about?And then, after this 10th summit, are we going to be seeing changes in migration policies in the way migrants are being treated?And finally, let me\u2014this is for President Biden: fentanyl. What concrete actions are you going to be implementing? What's the impact of the detention of Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n? Because the Cartel of the Pacific is one of the main fentanyl producers.And finally, another question on energy sector consultations. President Biden, Prime Minister Trudeau, did you discuss those discussions about the USMCA, the T-MEC?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nVery well. We did speak about migration in a very broad manner. Of course, there is cooperation with the U.S. administration. And at the same time, we have a commitment to protect migrants.What President Biden has proposed is absolutely true. If migrants cross our country\u2014and, in some cases, they also go through other countries in Latin America\u2014to arrive in the United States, migrants are facing so many risks when they do that, starting with the fact that they are victims of the trafficants\u2014the smugglers\u2014the human traffickers known as the or . And they charge migrants a high amount of money to take them northbound.Now, those or have networks. And at the same time, they hire trailers, trucks\u2014truck trailers. The box of the trailer, they can transport up to 300, 400 people. So the\u2014constant accidents are taking place on the highways of Mexico, the roads of Mexico, unfortunately.And the worst of it all is that many migrants are being kidnapped by criminal groups, by criminals. They're being murdered. And this is very sad, very painful.That's why I'm speaking about protection. We\u2014what we want is an in-depth solution. We've always said that people\u2014just as President Biden said, people do not leave their towns, their countries, their families because they like to do it. This is not a pleasure for them. They do it because of the needs they have. This is a necessity.We've always said we have to look at the root causes of all this. We have to try for people to be able to work and be happy where they were born, where their relatives, their customs, their traditions, their cultures are. And we need to invest for that. We need to invest in development of the countries with more inequality and poverty, because migration has to be an optional thing, not a forced situation.However, in the meantime\u2014because we're, of course, doing everything we can to accomplish this\u2014Mexico, with just a few resources, is helping. I have already mentioned that we are working\u2014we are working with communities in El Salvador, in Honduras. We're going to be starting this in Guatemala and Belize as well.However, we do need to promote development even more\u2014and well-being\u2014to ensure, guarantee opportunities for those that are forced to migrate and leave their communities.We are not thinking of building any center in the southeastern part of Mexico\u2014any migration center. We're not thinking of that. What we do is help with shelters, with health care services, with food services as well. That's the way we help migrants.And we do celebrate the fact that the U.S. administration has taken\u2014made the decision, rather, to have an orderly migration flow in the case, for instance, of our Venezuelan brothers and sisters. And I understand that this plan will also be extended\u2014will be expanded to benefit other migrants, other countries.We know for sure that since the announcement was made saying that those permits, humanitarian visas were going to be granted in the case, for instance, of the Venezuelan population, we've seen a decrease in migration flows, or people crossing Mexico to migrate.This has been a considerable reduction because this was announced in the United States, and this was made public everywhere, saying that 24,000 humanitarian visas or permits were going to be granted and that the formalities had to be covered, the paperwork. Although there are some requirements that have to be met, people decided to do it. So what happened was that a new path has been opened; it didn't exist before.Everything was arriving in the United States, risking everything\u2014risking people's lives, of course, at the risk of their own lives. Now that this mechanism has been approved, people can file their own request. And this might take time. However, there's hope. A hope that this is\u2014a purpose is going to be accomplished: the purpose of going to the United States to work, to live.We celebrate this, and we think that\u2014I insist what Canada is doing is also the right thing to do.And I was talking about our own experience as well. And you can look at data. It's there for you to look at. Because of circumstances in the past, migration corresponded to the sister countries of Central America that were\u2014those were the main migration flows from Central America\u2014but, for a long time as well, Mexicans migrating who were going to look for a better living standard, who were going to look for a job in the United States.And just imagine: There are 40 million Mexicans in the United States\u201440 million who were born here in Mexico, or they're the children of people who were born in Mexico.Now, what have we been able to accomplish with all the support for well-being? We've reduced the number of Mexican migrants, yes. There are less migrants abandoning Mexico now because there's public investment; because out of 35 million families, 30 million families of Mexican families are now receiving at least a program\u2014a well-being program. And this is a very direct manner of doing this here in Mexico.All the senior citizens, 65 or over, receive a pension. This is a universal program in Mexico. Eleven million of senior citizens in Mexico are getting a pension. Eleven million students of low-income families, of poor families are getting grants. They're getting scholarships. All the boys and girls with disabilities also have their own pension.We have a program for reforestation. It is the most important reforestation program in the world. And we are planting over 1 million hectares of fruit and timber trees. And we are giving jobs to over 400,000 peasants that are growing, planting those trees.So, then, all these programs help so that people may be staying in their own communities, in their towns.We built the Dos Bocas refinery\u201435,000 jobs. We are now building the Mayan train, which is the biggest railroad works in the world because it's 1,554 kilometers\u20141,554 kilometers\u2014in five States of Mexico.All the Maya region\u2014which is one of the most important archaeological zones of the world\u2014well, there, people are working, building this railroad system. About 300,000 people are building the train. So that's really the option. That's the path to follow: development, well-being.And I insist, I repeat: I truly celebrate that the Canadian Government and the U.S. administration, as well, are now attending to the migration problem with this type of approach. It's quite lamentable that there are others\u2014other politicians, other Presidents and public officials who are acting in a very inhuman manner.Right now, in this winter season, for instance, with all due respect\u2014I'm not saying this in a very direct manner, but what I'm saying is that, I mean, one of the Governors of our neighboring country headed a movement to take migrants to New York, to Washington, and just drop them there. This is politicking. This is completely inhuman. This should not be done. Because there are those who forget that we are all migrants.How is it that that great nation, the United States, was developed? With migrants. Thanks to that, so then we have to continue seeking, looking for alternatives. Just as, for instance, also in the case of violence, we have to look into the root causes of violence.And also in the case of our country, youth were never cared for. No services for young people. And the only thing that was done was call them young people who didn't work, who didn't study. This is a discriminatory labeling for youth. They don't study; they don't work. they were called in Mexico. They don't do one thing. They don't do the other thing either.So no one was ever caring for our youth in Mexico. All those young people only had\u2014the only option they had, I mean, was to migrate. And many migrated, acting in a respectful manner, a very responsible fashion. And others as well were trying to make a living because they didn't have any other opportunities. So they made a living in what we call the informal economy, which is, you know, making a living out in the street, no matter what. I mean, whichever way you can make a living without falling into illicit activities. However, unfortunately, many did go into the path of antisocial behaviors.But we didn't really take care of young people in Mexico. However, we now have a program devoted to young people. This program never existed in the past. There are 2.4 million young people who are being hired. They are working, and they're apprentices.What are we doing? We are taking away from them this culture, those seats, the reserves, the stock. We're taking that away from criminal groups. We're taking youth\u2014we don't want our youth to be hooked. We don't want those criminal groups to be taking our youth away. We want to give them opportunities. That's exactly what we're doing in Mexico.And let me conclude also highlighting another difference which is quite important: There is no corruption in the administration, the Government that I represent. There's no impunity either.There's\u2014we have painted this line that is very clear. Crime is one thing, and the authority is a different thing. There is no criminal association or partnership as before.Yes, this is\u2014we're even ashamed to mention this, that\u2014to mention that those who were in charge of guaranteeing or ensuring public security were at the service\u2014in the past\u2014were at the service of criminal organizations.

On fentanyl and energy consultations?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes, we are doing that. Just as I was telling you that in the case of migration, first there were brothers and sisters from Central America and also from Mexico, but now, in recent times, a lot of migrants from Venezuela, from Nicaragua, Colombia, Ecuador.We do have a situation. This is a\u2014these are changes in places where we're\u2014places where people are being pushed to leave their towns, their place of origin for many reasons.And with drugs, we have a case in point. It is not cannabis. It's not marijuana. It's not poppies\u2014poppy. It's not only cocaine either. Now, we have fentanyl and chemicals, which are some of the most dangerous type of substance and very harmful for people because they are causing so many deaths.So then, we're working on this in an organized manner. In the case of Mexico, this led us to make all the ports in the customs offices to be controlled by the armed forces in Mexico, all the sea customs office, because fentanyl and other chemicals come from Asia, and they are processed in labs. And we are avoiding the entrance of those chemical substances, and we are destroying labs.The Navy Secretariat is in charge of managing ports and customs\u2014sea customs offices. For instance, we had so much trafficking of chemicals in the port of Manzanillo and also in L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas. Now, the Navy is in charge of controlling those customs.And all the customs, the land customs offices along the border line are now under the responsibility of the Ministry of Defense\u2014National Defense Ministry.So we are combating fentanyl and those chemicals, and we're doing this because we care. Nothing human is alien to us. We truly care being able to help and to be of help\u2014the situation in the United States\u2014deaths because of overdose of fentanyl.And\u2014but just as we discussed today, this is not only an issue of the United States. The thing is that if we do not face this problem, this scourge, we are going to suffer it ourselves as well. So we have to act in a coordinated fashion. And that is something we have been doing, and we discussed it in this summit. It is in the communique we are about to give you. And we are defending life\u2014the life.As I was telling you\u2014I was telling Prime Minister Trudeau and President Biden\u2014their teams, I was telling them as well: We only have two campaigns\u2014publicity or propaganda campaigns\u2014in the Government, in my administration. One is dedicated or devoted to not consuming drugs: Say no to drugs. Because we have to also think of that. It became quite a famous thing\u2014public fame. Everything related to gangs. They are even series of gangs and organized crime\u2014gangs of organized crimes.And this is like an apology of that which is desirable, because there are residences, very rich homes in those series, very luxurious homes, and the cars. Men and women\u2014all very good looking\u2014very handsome men and women well dressed with jewelry all over the place, with a lot of power. And they pick up the phone, and they call the head of the police force, head of the military, or even a President of a country. And that's what's being disseminated all over.But we have seen a series on the damage caused by fentanyl, how, in 6 months, the life of a young person is destroyed. And what those doses contain, they have muriatic acid. Do people inform about the situation? Do people let other people know about this? No, of course not. So we are going to be launching an information campaign.As I was telling the President and the Prime Minister, I said vapers\u2014yes, they say: Well, they're not bad. I mean, they just have five substances. That's it. But they're not bad.We did some research on this. Over 30 substances, harmful and cancer-causing substances in those devices people smoke with. However, because of the lobbying, corruption as well, the publicity or advertising management, then\u2014this is being allowed.And there are many parents and mothers, fathers who don't even know the damage that their\u2014our children are going through because of vapors. We have to look into this.But, really, this is not only the responsibility of the Government, this is also the responsibility of the media. You can also help us so much on this to, you know, spread the word, to inform people. Radio stations, television networks\u2014they should be devoting time for this to inform people, to guide people on this on how bad drugs can be for people's health and that people can be successful and they can be happy without having, without needing to fall into drug addiction, those mortal traps.Well, all this, that's what we've been discussing. I think I'm taking more than the time that I should have taken. It's cold outside.Thank you so much, everyone. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. Thank you so much. I want the record to show: I don't know what questions I didn't answer. I'm prepared later. Thank you very much.

On fentanyl and energy consultations?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes, we are doing that. Just as I was telling you that in the case of migration, first there were brothers and sisters from Central America and also from Mexico, but now, in recent times, a lot of migrants from Venezuela, from Nicaragua, Colombia, Ecuador.We do have a situation. This is a\u2014these are changes in places where we're\u2014places where people are being pushed to leave their towns, their place of origin for many reasons.And with drugs, we have a case in point. It is not cannabis. It's not marijuana. It's not poppies\u2014poppy. It's not only cocaine either. Now, we have fentanyl and chemicals, which are some of the most dangerous type of substance and very harmful for people because they are causing so many deaths.So then, we're working on this in an organized manner. In the case of Mexico, this led us to make all the ports in the customs offices to be controlled by the armed forces in Mexico, all the sea customs office, because fentanyl and other chemicals come from Asia, and they are processed in labs. And we are avoiding the entrance of those chemical substances, and we are destroying labs.The Navy Secretariat is in charge of managing ports and customs\u2014sea customs offices. For instance, we had so much trafficking of chemicals in the port of Manzanillo and also in L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas. Now, the Navy is in charge of controlling those customs.And all the customs, the land customs offices along the border line are now under the responsibility of the Ministry of Defense\u2014National Defense Ministry.So we are combating fentanyl and those chemicals, and we're doing this because we care.

You know, I get kidded for saying that there's\u2014all politics is personal. It's all about looking someone in the eye. And I mean it sincerely.I don't think there's any, any, any substitute for sitting down face to face with a friend or a foe and looking them in the eye. And that's exactly what's happening at this moment. We've done that more than once, and we're going to continue to do it.And the winter is setting in, and Putin is increasingly going after civilian targets and women and children, orphanages. This guy is\u2014well\u2014but he's going to fail. And he's going to fail. He's already failed, because he now knows that there's no way he's ever going to occupy all of Ukraine. There's no way in which he's going to be accepted by the Ukrainian people.And so he's failed in the past. And it was very important for him and everyone else to see that President Zelenskyy and I are united, two countries together, to make sure he cannot succeed.And I think\u2014I may be mistaken, but I know\u2014I judge every leader by the way they\u2014what they say to me, their consistency, and looking me in the eye.This guy\u2014\u2014[]\u2014\u2014has in his\u2014to his very soul is who he says he is.

Thank you, Mr. President. I will have a question for you and one for the French President, if I may.For you, first, you now are saying that you are going to better coordinate, especially your green economic policies. But yesterday Emmanuel Macron said that the Inflation Reduction Act is, in fact, superaggressive, I quote, toward European companies. Does that mean that you are ready to grant exception\u2014exemptions of the regulations to European industries?And now my question to you, Monsieur President.[The reporter spoke in French, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]Mr. President, will you leave Washington with the assurance that you will be able to deal with these massive\u2014[inaudible]?Interpreter. The journalist doesn't have a microphone. Q. Do you think there is risk of generating divisions?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI'll answer the last question, since I didn't hear any of it. I didn't understand a word of it, so I'll answer it. [][] Can we take care of it? [] No, look, the United States makes no apology\u2014and I make no apologies, since I wrote it for\u2014the legislation you're talking about.But there are occasions when you write a massive piece of legislation\u2014and that has almost $368 billion dollars for the largest investment in climate change on all\u2014of all of history. And so there's obviously going to be glitches in it and need to reconcile changes in it.For example, there's a provision in it that says that there is the exception for anyone has a free trade agreement with us. Well, that was added by a Member of the United States Congress who acknowledges that he just meant allies; he didn't mean, literally, free trade agreement. So there's a lot we can work out.But the essence of it is, we're going to make sure that the United States continues\u2014and just as I hope Europe will be able to continue\u2014not to have to rely on anybody else's supply chain. We're\u2014we are our own supply chain, and we share that with Europe and all of our allies. And they will, in fact, have the opportunity to do the same thing.So there's tweaks that we can make that can fundamentally make it easier for European countries to participate and/or be on their own. But that is something that is a matter to be worked out.There is no fundamental\u2014it was never intended, when I wrote the legislation\u2014I never intended to exclude folks who were cooperating with us. That was not the intention.The intention was to make sure we no longer were in a position\u2014when there was a pandemic in Asia, and China decided they're going to no longer sell us computer chips. We invented the damn things, you know? []So it's\u2014anyway\u2014but my point is, we're back in business, Europe is back in business, and we're going to continue to create manufacturing jobs in America, but not at the expense of Europe.[.] What we've been discussing with President Biden and what, as a matter of fact, he just said\u2014and that's what I talked about with the caucus yesterday\u2014that simple: The United States of America adopted a piece of legislation for their country, for their industry, which\u2014with a common objective, goal that we share: creating jobs, creating opportunities for the middle class, and succeeding in implementing the energy transition.The reality is that the consequences, as we've seen in our discussions\u2014it is certainly not the intention of the United States, but, as a matter of fact, projects that were growing\u2014being developed in Europe, there's such a difference in subsidies that these projects might come to an end.And a number of Senators, yesterday, like\u2014said it was certainly not their intention. So France simply did not come to ask for an exemption or another for our economy, but simply to discuss the consequences of this legislation.And the news\u2014the circumstances mean that we have no alternative, but to work together. So, therefore, I believe we need to resynchronize, as I say, find a new policy to clarify our goals and continue together. And the discussion we had this morning was extremely clear. And I could feel the very same intent on behalf of the Members of the Congress yesterday.And the wish of President Biden is to rebuild a strong industry here and to have somehow to secure some technology solutions for the future. France wishes exactly the same thing for itself. And we're\u2014we've been fighting, day in, day out, to do the very same thing in our country. And this will enable us to put an end to some 15 years of industry loss in our country and to have new manufacturing jobs.And so we'll be working on that. And we decided to do that together with the other members of the European Union and the European Commission. So we will work on the technical elements to make sure that there is no domino effect on ongoing projects in Europe. We want to succeed together, not one against the other.It's been clear. This is the outcome of our discussions this morning. And this is exactly the philosophy that I share, and it is the one that we need.

That was not the intention.The intention was to make sure we no longer were in a position\u2014when there was a pandemic in Asia, and China decided they're going to no longer sell us computer chips. We invented the damn things, you know? []So it's\u2014anyway\u2014but my point is, we're back in business, Europe is back in business, and we're going to continue to create manufacturing jobs in America, but not at the expense of Europe.[.] What we've been discussing with President Biden and what, as a matter of fact, he just said\u2014and that's what I talked about with the caucus yesterday\u2014that simple: The United States of America adopted a piece of legislation for their country, for their industry, which\u2014with a common objective, goal that we share: creating jobs, creating opportunities for the middle class, and succeeding in implementing the energy transition.The reality is that the consequences, as we've seen in our discussions\u2014it is certainly not the intention of the United States, but, as a matter of fact, projects that were growing\u2014being developed in Europe, there's such a difference in subsidies that these projects might come to an end.And a number of Senators, yesterday, like\u2014said it was certainly not their intention. So France simply did not come to ask for an exemption or another for our economy, but simply to discuss the consequences of this legislation.And the news\u2014the circumstances mean that we have no alternative, but to work together. So, therefore, I believe we need to resynchronize, as I say, find a new policy to clarify our goals and continue together. And the discussion we had this morning was extremely clear. And I could feel the very same intent on behalf of the Members of the Congress yesterday.And the wish of President Biden is to rebuild a strong industry here and to have somehow to secure some technology solutions for the future. France wishes exactly the same thing for itself. And we're\u2014we've been fighting, day in, day out, to do the very same thing in our country. And this will enable us to put an end to some 15 years of industry loss in our country and to have new manufacturing jobs.And so we'll be working on that. And we decided to do that together with the other members of the European Union and the European Commission. So we will work on the technical elements to make sure that there is no domino effect on ongoing projects in Europe. We want to succeed together, not one against the other.It's been clear. This is the outcome of our discussions this morning. And this is exactly the philosophy that I share, and it is the one that we need.

Thank you, Mr. President. I will have a question for you and one for the French President, if I may.For you, first, you now are saying that you are going to better coordinate, especially your green economic policies. But yesterday Emmanuel Macron said that the Inflation Reduction Act is, in fact, superaggressive, I quote, toward European companies. Does that mean that you are ready to grant exception\u2014exemptions of the regulations to European industries?And now my question to you, Monsieur President.[The reporter spoke in French, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]Mr. President, will you leave Washington with the assurance that you will be able to deal with these massive\u2014[inaudible]?Interpreter. The journalist doesn't have a microphone. Q. Do you think there is risk of generating divisions?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI'll answer the last question, since I didn't hear any of it. I didn't understand a word of it, so I'll answer it. [][] Can we take care of it? [] No, look, the United States makes no apology\u2014and I make no apologies, since I wrote it for\u2014the legislation you're talking about.But there are occasions when you write a massive piece of legislation\u2014and that has almost $368 billion dollars for the largest investment in climate change on all\u2014of all of history. And so there's obviously going to be glitches in it and need to reconcile changes in it.For example, there's a provision in it that says that there is the exception for anyone has a free trade agreement with us. Well, that was added by a Member of the United States Congress who acknowledges that he just meant allies; he didn't mean, literally, free trade agreement. So there's a lot we can work out.But the essence of it is, we're going to make sure that the United States continues\u2014and just as I hope Europe will be able to continue\u2014not to have to rely on anybody else's supply chain. We're\u2014we are our own supply chain, and we share that with Europe and all of our allies. And they will, in fact, have the opportunity to do the same thing.So there's tweaks that we can make that can fundamentally make it easier for European countries to participate and/or be on their own. But that is something that is a matter to be worked out.There is no fundamental\u2014it was never intended, when I wrote the legislation\u2014I never intended to exclude folks who were cooperating with us.

Thank you, Mr. President. I have a domestic question for you. And then, Mr. Macron, I have a President\u2014a question for you about Ukraine.But first, President Biden, do the freight rail workers deserve more than 1 day of paid sick leave, like millions of Americans have? And if so, why didn't you negotiate for that when you were helping to negotiate that contract that you now want Congress to impose?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI love you guys. I negotiated a contract no one else could negotiate. The only thing that was left out was whether or not it was a paid leave.You know I've been trying to get paid leave not just for rail workers, for everybody. But that other team\u2014they're called the Republicans\u2014they voted against it. They said we couldn't do it. We're one of the few nations in the world that don't have paid leave for our workers.And so what we're doing is\u2014we can't afford to have\u2014and by the way, in the meantime, they got a 43\u201445-percent increase in salary, et cetera. There's a lot of good things that happened in that.And if in fact this shuts down over the question of 1 to 5 paid\u2014or 7 or 9 or whatever the number is that've been negotiating\u2014of paid leave days, it's going to immediately cost 750,000 jobs and cause a recession.And so what I made really clear is that\u2014what was negotiated was so much better than anything they ever had that it's worth\u2014and they all signed on to it, by the way. There are only four unions that\u2014out of the 13 or 14\u2014that didn't agree. So the majority at the time it was\u2014that I presented it, they asked me to do it. I presented it; they all signed on.But here's the story: It doesn't mean because we are going to pass this, God willing, on\u2014by Friday, by the time the\u2014by the weekend that we're\u2014that I'm going to back off of paid leave.I made it really clear: I'm going to continue to fight for paid leave for not only rail workers, but for all American workers. I suppose\u2014I imagine it may surprise some of our European friends that there's no paid leave in the United States of America. We're one of the few major countries in the world that don't have it. It's about time.And so that's the context in which this all took place. And you know, and labor signed on to it as well, as you recall, initially. There were 4 unions out of the, I think, 13 or 14 that didn't like it.And\u2014but I think we're going to get it done, but not within this agreement\u2014not within this agreement. We're going to avoid the rail strike, keep the rails running, keep things moving, and I'm going to go back, and we're going to get paid leave not just for rail workers, but for all workers.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo freight rail workers deserve more than 1 day of paid sick leave\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

We hear that you will be talking to President Putin anytime soon. What is your approach?And as the Ukrainian war seems to be at a turning point, do you feel realistic that President Zelenskyy is putting a condition to open negotiations and that is the return of Crimea to Ukraine?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nLook, there is one way for this war to end the rational way: Putin to pull out of Ukraine. Number one. But it appears he's not going to do that. He's paying a very heavy price for failing to do it, but he's inflicting incredible, incredible carnage on the civilian population of Ukraine, bombing nurseries, hospitals, children's homes. It's sick what he's doing.But the fact of the matter is, I have no immediate plans to contact Mr. Putin. Mr. Putin is\u2014let me choose my words very carefully\u2014I'm prepared to speak with Mr. Putin if in fact there is an interest in him deciding he's looking for a way to end the war. He hasn't done that yet. If that's the case, in consultation with my French and my NATO friends, I'll be happy to sit down with Putin to see what he wants\u2014has in mind. He hasn't done that yet.In the meantime, I think it's absolutely critical what Emmanuel said: We must support the Ukrainian people. The idea that Putin is ever going to defeat Ukraine is beyond comprehension. Imagine them trying to occupy that country through the next 2, 5, 10, 20 years if they could\u2014if they could.He's miscalculated every single thing he initially calculated. He thought he'd be greeted with open arms by the Russian-speaking portions of the Ukrainian population.Go back and read his speech when he invaded\u2014when I said they were going to invade, and they did when we said they were. Go back and read the speech he made. He talked about him\u2014with needing to be another Peter the Great. He talked about the need for the people\u2014that Kyiv is the motherload of Russian identity in the beginning, et cetera, et cetera. He's just miscalculated across the board.And so the question is, what is his decision\u2014how does he get himself out of the circumstance he's in? I'm prepared, if he's willing to talk, to find out what he's willing to do, but I'll only do it in consultation with my NATO allies. I'm not going to do it on my own.Thank you.[.] Regarding your question and the preconditions or the conditions set by the Ukrainian President, I believe that what is important for all of us to look at is that as Ukraine is resisting, suffering from war crimes, attacks on their civilian infrastructure, leading counteroffensive, President Zelenskyy presented a 10-point peace plan.So we, I believe, very much need to continue to engage with him, because there is a genuine willingness, on behalf of Ukraine, to discuss these matters. And we acknowledge it, and we commend it.And, for a number of years, I was in charge of monitoring the implementation of the Minsk Agreements. And the latest\u2014at the last meeting between President Zelenskyy and President Putin, the only one\u2014December 2019\u2014at the time, I was with Chancellor Merkel. And I can tell you that I saw a President who was sincere in his willingness to talk and to negotiate.And since he was elected, until May, President Zelenskyy was very much willing to talk and negotiate. The one who wanted to go to war, to wage war was President Putin. And I could see it by myself, including when I visited Russia and Ukraine at the beginning of February.So it's only legitimate that President Zelenskyy sets some conditions to talk. We need to work on what could lead to a peace agreement, but it is for him to tell us when the time comes and what the choices of the Ukrainians are.So once this has been said, indeed, I will continue to talk to President Putin. And as a matter of fact, we talked about it this morning with President Biden, because we constantly, as well, tried to prevent escalation and to get some very concrete results.So I will talk to him about security and safety of nuclear plants in the areas that are being claimed, including Zaporizhzhia, in particular. And over the past few months, we did some work on the Chernobyl nuclear plant, and there is some outstanding work ongoing, which is very important, by Mr. Grossi and his agency, the IAEA. So we will continue.Thank you so much. Thanks, folks. All right.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat is your approach to talking with President Putin?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

And I can tell you that I saw a President who was sincere in his willingness to talk and to negotiate.And since he was elected, until May, President Zelenskyy was very much willing to talk and negotiate. The one who wanted to go to war, to wage war was President Putin. And I could see it by myself, including when I visited Russia and Ukraine at the beginning of February.So it's only legitimate that President Zelenskyy sets some conditions to talk. We need to work on what could lead to a peace agreement, but it is for him to tell us when the time comes and what the choices of the Ukrainians are.So once this has been said, indeed, I will continue to talk to President Putin. And as a matter of fact, we talked about it this morning with President Biden, because we constantly, as well, tried to prevent escalation and to get some very concrete results.So I will talk to him about security and safety of nuclear plants in the areas that are being claimed, including Zaporizhzhia, in particular. And over the past few months, we did some work on the Chernobyl nuclear plant, and there is some outstanding work ongoing, which is very important, by Mr. Grossi and his agency, the IAEA. So we will continue.Thank you so much. Thanks, folks. All right.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo you feel realistic that President Zelenskyy is putting a condition to open negotiations and that is the return of Crimea to Ukraine?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, Mr. President. You said at the outset of this meeting that you did not want competition to turn into conflict. Based on this meeting today, do you believe a new cold war with China can be avoided?And specifically, on the issue of Taiwan, you spoke about intentions. Do you believe China is preparing, intending to invade Taiwan at some point? And what warnings did you issue to President Xi if he were to take such action?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, to answer the first part of your question, I absolutely believe there's\u2014need not be a new cold war. We\u2014I've met many times with Xi Jinping, and we were candid and clear with one another across the board. And I do not think there's any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan.And I made it clear that our policy in Taiwan has not changed at all. It's the same exact position we've had. I made it clear that we want to see cross-strait issues peacefully resolved. And so it never has to come to that. And I'm convinced that he understood exactly what I was saying. I understood what he was saying.And look, I think the United States is better prepared than any country in the world, economically and politically, to deal with the changing circumstances around the world.And I think that\u2014I think Xi Jinping is\u2014we agreed that we would set up a set of circumstances where on issues that were\u2014that we had to further resolve details, we agreed that we would have our chief of staff\u2014our\u2014the appropriate Cabinet members and others sit and meet with one another to discuss the details of any\u2014every issue that we\u2014that was raised, and we raised a lot of issues.Seung Kim, Associated Press.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nCan a new cold war with China be avoided?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}
