What will you tell President Putin about this summit and about NATO?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I think he's going to see about this summit\u2014this has turned out to be a very successful summit. This is\u2014I think, really, that NATO is more put together right now, is more coordinated. And I think there's a better spirit for NATO right now than perhaps they've ever had. It's richer than it ever was. The commitments are made at a higher level than they've ever been made. And the money to be paid out faster, far faster.You know, the 2 percent was a range, a goal. It wasn't something that they were committed to. Now it's a commitment. There's a big difference, the 2-percent number. And that's why somany people weren't reaching it or hitting it. It was just sort of, like, this amorphous number out there. Now it's a commitment, a real commitment.I think he's going to see that there's great unity, great spirit, great esprit de corps. And I think we're going to have a good meeting. Regardless of that, I think we're going to have a good meeting.But this was a fantastic 2 days. This was a really fantastic\u2014it all came together at the end. And yes, it was a little tough for a little while, but ultimately\u2014you can ask anybody at that meeting\u2014they're really liking what happened over the last 2 days.

Thanks, Mr. President. Two questions for you, if you don't mind.

Why are you so comfortable calling him very talented?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, he is very talented. Anybody that takes over a situation like he did, at 26 years of age, and is able to run it and run it tough\u2014I don't say he was nice or I don't say anything about it\u2014he ran it. Very few people, at that age\u2014you can take 1 out of 10,000, probably, couldn't do it.Otto Warmbier is a very special person, and he will be for a long time, in my life. His parents are good friends of mine. I think without Otto this would not have happened. Something happened, from that day. It was a terrible thing. It was brutal. But a lot of people started to focus on what was going on, including North Korea.I really think that Otto is someone who did not die in vain. I told this to his parents. Special young man. And I have to say, special parents, special people. Otto did not die in vain. He had a lot to do with us being here today. Okay?

I'll be very respectful, sir. What did Kim Jong Un say to you to give you the confidence that, for once in the history of North Korea, they are not cheating the system and gaming the world and gaming the people who will have to go in and make sure that they're actually giving up their nuclear arsenal? What did he say to you?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes, I mean, very fair question. He actually mentioned the fact that they proceeded down a path in the past, and ultimately, as you know, nothing got done. In one case, they took billions of dollars\u2014during the Clinton regime\u2014took billions of dollars and nothing happened. That was a terrible thing, and he actually brought it up to me.And he said we have never gone this far. I don't think they've ever had the confidence, frankly, in a President that they have right now for getting things done and having the ability to get things done. And he was very firm in the fact that he wants to do this. I think he might want to do this as much or even more than me, because they see a very bright future for North Korea.So you never know. Right? We never know. But I'll tell you what, we signed a very comprehensive document today, and I think most of you have been given that document.

They want the remains of their fathers and mothers and all of the people that got caught into that really brutal war, which took place, to a large extent, in North Korea. And I asked for it today, and we got it. That was a very last minute. The remains will be coming back. They're going to start that process immediately.But so many people, even during the campaign, they'd say, Is there any way you can work with North Korea to get the remains of my son back or my father back? So many people asked me this question. And you know, I said, Look, we don't get along too well with that particular group of people. But now we do. And he agreed to that so quickly and so nice\u2014it was really a very nice thing, and he understands it.

I think he wants to\u2014you'd be very surprised. Very smart. Very good negotiator. Wants to do the right thing.

And does he need to change that?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nRight. Jon, I believe it's a rough situation over there. There's no question about it. And we did discuss it today pretty strongly. I mean, knowing what the main purpose of what we were doing is: denuking. But discussed it at pretty good length. We'll be doing something on it. It's rough. It's rough in a lot of places, by the way. Not just there. But it's rough, and we will continue that. And I think, ultimately, we'll agree to something.

You signed a document with Kim Jong Un. It's essentially a piece of paper. Yesterday we had a briefing from the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He said the following: Many Presidents previously have signed off on pieces of paper only to find that the North Koreans either didn't promise what we thought they had or actually reneged on those promises. What makes this time different, Mr. President?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, you have a different administration. You have a different President. You have a different Secretary of State. You have people that are\u2014you know, it's very important to them. And we get it done. The other groups, maybe it wasn't a priority. I don't think they could have done it if it was a priority, frankly. I don't think they honestly could have done it even if it was a priority.And it would have been easier back then. It would have been\u2014for me, it would have been much easier if this were 10 years ago or 5 years ago. And I'm not just blaming President Obama. I mean, this goes back\u2014for 25 years, this should have happened. I was given a very tough hand. I was given this, I was given the Iran deal and plenty of other problems.But we are\u2014we're doing really well. And the Iran deal, I have to be honest, we\u2014I did it because nuclear is always number one to me. Nuclear is number one. But on the Iran deal, I think Iran is a different country now than it was 3 or 4 months ago. I don't think they're looking so much to the Mediterranean. I don't think they're looking so much at Syria, like they were, with total confidence. I don't think they're so confident right now.But I hope\u2014with that being said, I hope that, at the appropriate time, after these sanctions kick in\u2014and they are brutal, what we've put on Iran\u2014I hope that they're going to come back and negotiate a real deal, because I'd love to be able to do that.

And we call them war games, and I call them war games. And they're tremendously expensive. The amount of money that we spend on that is incredible. And South Korea contributes, but not a hundred percent, which is certainly a subject that we have to talk to them about also. And that has to do with the military expense and also the trade.So we're doing that. We actually have a new deal with South Korea, in terms of the trade deal, but we have to talk to them. We have to talk to many countries about treating us fairly.But the war games are very expensive. We pay for a big majority of them. We fly in bombers from Guam. I said it\u2014when I first started, I said, Where do the bombers come from? Guam. Nearby. I said: Oh, great, nearby. Where's nearby? Six and a half hours. Six and a half hours, that's a long time for these big massive planes to be flying to South Korea to practice and then drop bombs all over the place and then go back to Guam. I know a lot about airplanes; it's very expensive.

Does North Korea give you something in return though?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, we've gotten\u2014you know, I've heard that. I mean, some of the people that\u2014I don't know, maybe they really mean it. I don't always want to go against the press, because I just don't\u2014especially not today, this is too important. But I noticed that some of the people were saying that the President has agreed to meet, he has given up so much. I gave up nothing. I'm here. I haven't slept in 25 hours, but I thought it was appropriate to do\u2014because we have been negotiating for literally around the clock with them and with us and with John and with Mike and a whole team of very talented people.But we haven't given up anything, other than\u2014you're right, I agreed to meet. And I think the meeting was every bit as good for the United States as it was for North Korea. But I just wrote down some of the things we got. And they\u2014you know, they\u2014sure, they got a meeting. But only a person that dislikes Donald Trump would say that I've agreed to make a big commitment. Sure, I've agreed to take a period of time and come here and meet, and that's good. But I think it's great for us and\u2014as a country, and I think it's good for them. But what did they do to justify this meeting? Secured commitment for complete denuclearization; that's the big thing. They secured the release of three American hostages. They already gave them to us 2 months ago. These people are now living happily back in their homes with their families. And it was pretty rough for them, to put it mildly.Secure the commitment to recover the remains, including\u2014these are of fallen heroes. And they're giving a commitment, they're starting it immediately, to recover their remains. And I just went through how many people asked me about it. I was amazed, actually. So many people would ask me: Is it possible? Is it possible? At that time we had no relationship to Chairman Kim or to anybody else in North Korea. You know, it was a very closed society. So we're getting the remains back.Secured the halt of all missile and nuclear tests for\u2014how long has it been? Seven months? You haven't had a missile go up. For 7 months, you haven't had a nuclear test; you haven't had a nuclear explosion. I remember a nuclear event took place, 8.8 in the Richter scale. And they announced\u2014I heard it on the radio, they announced that a massive\u2014you know, an earthquake took place somewhere in Asia. And then, they said it was in North Korea. And then, they found out it was a nuclear test. I said, I never heard of a Richter scale in the high 8s.And if you look, there has been no missile launches. They've blown up their missile area. That's going to take place. That has not been written into the contract. We're going to give you the exact details on that. But they secured a halt of all missiles and of all nuclear tests. They secured the closure of their single primary nuclear test flight\u2014test site. All three of them\u2014they're in an area that's common around each other\u2014they secured the closure.They secured the commitment to destroy the missile engine testing site. That was not in your agreement. I got that after we signed the agreement. I said: Do me a favor. You've got this missile engine testing site. We know where it is because of the heat. We\u2014it's incredible the equipment we have, to be honest with you. I said, Can you close it up? He's going to close it up.We maintained the ability to continue to apply sanctions. So we're applying sanctions. Now, I had 300 sanctions that I was getting ready to put on last week. And I said, you know, I can't really put on sanctions when I'm meeting with\u2014I thought it would be very disrespectful. Three hundred very big ones, powerful ones. And I said it would be disrespectful.So, Jennifer, when you look at all of those things that we got\u2014and when we got our hostages back, I didn't pay $1.8 billion in cash like the hostages that came back from Iran, which was a disgraceful situation, what took place.So we've gotten a lot. So when I hear somebody in the media say that President Trump has agreed to meet, like, it's not a big deal to meet. I think we should meet on a lot of different topics, not just this one. And I really believe a lot of great things can happen.Yes.

They have started; they blew up their sites. They blew up their testing site.But I will say, he knew, prior to coming\u2014you know, this wasn't, like, a surprise. It wasn't like we've never discussed it. We discussed it. Mike discussed it very strongly with his counterpart in North Korea. They knew that this was\u2014let's say they didn't agree to that I couldn't sign any agreement. There was no agreement that could have been signed. So they understood that.And it wasn't a big point today because, really, this had been taken care of, more than any other thing. Because it was all about this.

Mr. President, it's been a busy week for you on the international stage. You're leaving this summit here in Singapore having determined that Kim Jong Un is a talented man. You left the G-7 summit a few days ago in Canada having determined that Prime Minister Trudeau is weak and dishonest. What do you say to America's allies who worry that you might be jeopardizing our long-term alliances and who worry that you might be treating our historic friends as enemies and our historic enemies as friends?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, I think it's a very fair question. I had a very good meeting with the G-7. And I left the meeting. And, I'll be honest, we are being taken advantage of by virtually every one of those countries. Very, very seriously. Now, the United States, because of bad management at the top, because of Presidents that didn't care about trade or didn't understand it or whatever reason. For many years, with China being, obviously, the most successful at it, but the European Union is second\u2014$151 billion we lost. They were represented at the meeting. And we're being taken advantage of on trade.Canada does have very big advantages over us in terms of trade deficits. We have a big trade deficit with Canada, I was reading, where, oh, it's actually a surplus. Not a surplus. It's either 17, but it could actually be 100. You know, they put out a document. I don't know if you saw it. They didn't want me to see it, but we found it. Perhaps they were trying to show the power they have. It's close to $100 billion-a-year loss with Canada. They don't take our farm products, many of them. They charge what was 270 percent, but somebody told me the other day that a few months ago they raised it to 295 percent for dairy products. And it's very unfair to our farmers, and it's very unfair to the people of our country: the workers, the farmers, the companies. And we are not able to trade. They have tremendous barriers up. They have tremendous tariffs.So when I put in a countervailing tariff just to get us up a little bit so the balance isn't so much\u2014it's like this\u2014they said, Oh, that's so terrible. I said: What's terrible? We have to catch you a little bit. We have to have a little balance. Even if it's not complete, we have to have a little balance. I say this with many countries.Anyway, we came\u2014we finished the meeting. Really, everybody was happy. And I agreed to sign something. I asked for changes; I demanded changes. And those changes were made. In fact, the picture with Angela Merkel, who I get along with very well, where I'm sitting there like this, that picture was we're waiting for the document, because I wanted to see the final document as changed by the changes that I requested.That was a very friendly\u2014I know it didn't look friendly, and I know it was reported like sort of nasty both ways. I was angry at her or she\u2014actually, we were just talking, the whole group, about something unrelated to everything, very friendly, waiting for the document to come back so I could read it before I leave.Anyway, I left, and it was very friendly. When I got onto the plane, I think that Justin probably didn't know that Air Force One has about 20 televisions, and I see the television. And he's giving a news conference about how he will not be pushed around by the United States. And I say, push him around? We just shook hands. It was very friendly.Look, countries cannot continue to take advantage of us on trade. The numbers are out. Over the last couple of years, and over the last many years\u2014but over the last couple of years, this country has lost $800 billion on trade with other countries, the biggest one being China. Eight-hundred billion dollars. A hundred fifty-one billion with the European Union. They don't take our agricultural products, barely. They don't take a lot of what we have, and yet they send Mercedes into us, they send BMWs into us by the millions. It's very unfair, and it's very unfair to our workers. And I'm going to straighten it out. And it won't even be tough. Okay? Thank you.Go ahead. Go ahead.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat do you say to America's allies who worry that you might be jeopardizing our long-term alliances?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

And it's very unfair to our farmers, and it's very unfair to the people of our country: the workers, the farmers, the companies. And we are not able to trade. They have tremendous barriers up. They have tremendous tariffs.So when I put in a countervailing tariff just to get us up a little bit so the balance isn't so much\u2014it's like this\u2014they said, Oh, that's so terrible. I said: What's terrible? We have to catch you a little bit. We have to have a little balance. Even if it's not complete, we have to have a little balance. I say this with many countries.Anyway, we came\u2014we finished the meeting. Really, everybody was happy. And I agreed to sign something. I asked for changes; I demanded changes. And those changes were made. In fact, the picture with Angela Merkel, who I get along with very well, where I'm sitting there like this, that picture was we're waiting for the document, because I wanted to see the final document as changed by the changes that I requested.That was a very friendly\u2014I know it didn't look friendly, and I know it was reported like sort of nasty both ways. I was angry at her or she\u2014actually, we were just talking, the whole group, about something unrelated to everything, very friendly, waiting for the document to come back so I could read it before I leave.Anyway, I left, and it was very friendly. When I got onto the plane, I think that Justin probably didn't know that Air Force One has about 20 televisions, and I see the television. And he's giving a news conference about how he will not be pushed around by the United States. And I say, push him around? We just shook hands. It was very friendly.Look, countries cannot continue to take advantage of us on trade. The numbers are out. Over the last couple of years, and over the last many years\u2014but over the last couple of years, this country has lost $800 billion on trade with other countries, the biggest one being China. Eight-hundred billion dollars. A hundred fifty-one billion with the European Union. They don't take our agricultural products, barely. They don't take a lot of what we have, and yet they send Mercedes into us, they send BMWs into us by the millions. It's very unfair, and it's very unfair to our workers. And I'm going to straighten it out. And it won't even be tough. Okay? Thank you.Go ahead.

Mr. President, it's been a busy week for you on the international stage. You're leaving this summit here in Singapore having determined that Kim Jong Un is a talented man. You left the G-7 summit a few days ago in Canada having determined that Prime Minister Trudeau is weak and dishonest. What do you say to America's allies who worry that you might be jeopardizing our long-term alliances and who worry that you might be treating our historic friends as enemies and our historic enemies as friends?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, I think it's a very fair question. I had a very good meeting with the G-7. And I left the meeting. And, I'll be honest, we are being taken advantage of by virtually every one of those countries. Very, very seriously. Now, the United States, because of bad management at the top, because of Presidents that didn't care about trade or didn't understand it or whatever reason. For many years, with China being, obviously, the most successful at it, but the European Union is second\u2014$151 billion we lost. They were represented at the meeting. And we're being taken advantage of on trade.Canada does have very big advantages over us in terms of trade deficits. We have a big trade deficit with Canada, I was reading, where, oh, it's actually a surplus. Not a surplus. It's either 17, but it could actually be 100. You know, they put out a document. I don't know if you saw it. They didn't want me to see it, but we found it. Perhaps they were trying to show the power they have. It's close to $100 billion-a-year loss with Canada. They don't take our farm products, many of them. They charge what was 270 percent, but somebody told me the other day that a few months ago they raised it to 295 percent for dairy products. And it's very unfair to our farmers, and it's very unfair to the people of our country: the workers, the farmers, the companies. And we are not able to trade. They have tremendous barriers up.

If I may, a second question. In the document that you signed earlier today, North Korea agreed to commit to denuclearization. To borrow a phrase that you have used to criticize your predecessors and political opponents, how do you ensure that North Korea is not all talk, no action going forward?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I think can you ensure anything? Can I ensure that you're going to be able to sit down properly when you sit down? I mean, you can't ensure anything. All I can say is they want to make a deal. That's what I do. My whole life has been deals. I've done great at it, and that's what I do. And I know when somebody wants to deal, and I know when somebody doesn't. A lot of politicians don't. That's not their thing, but it is my thing.I mean, again, this really could have been done, I think, easier a long time ago. But I know for a\u2014I just feel very strongly\u2014my instinct, my ability, or talent\u2014they want to make a deal. And making a deal is a great thing for the world.

If I may, a second question. In the document that you signed earlier today, North Korea agreed to commit to denuclearization. To borrow a phrase that you have used to criticize your predecessors and political opponents, how do you ensure that North Korea is not all talk, no action going forward?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I think can you ensure anything? Can I ensure that you're going to be able to sit down properly when you sit down? I mean, you can't ensure anything. All I can say is they want to make a deal. That's what I do. My whole life has been deals. I've done great at it, and that's what I do. And I know when somebody wants to deal, and I know when somebody doesn't. A lot of politicians don't. That's not their thing, but it is my thing.I mean, again, this really could have been done, I think, easier a long time ago. But I know for a\u2014I just feel very strongly\u2014my instinct, my ability, or talent\u2014they want to make a deal. And making a deal is a great thing for the world.

There's nothing I can say. All I can do is do what I can do. We have to stop the nuclearization. We have to do other things, and that's a very important thing. So at a certain point, hopefully, you'll be able to ask me a much more positive question or make a statement.But not much I can do right now. At a certain point, I really believe he's going to do things about it. I think they are one of the great winners today, that large group of people that you're talking about.

You alluded at the very beginning that the Chinese are not doing as great a job securing the border as they were before. You expressed some doubts when Kim went to see President Xi. The Russian Foreign Minister was in Pyongyang and said there shouldn't be any sanctions while these negotiations are underway. And the South Koreans are now talking about restoring some form of trade. So with all of those players appearing to be moving toward eroding sanctions, how can you keep the sanctions regime in place? What leverage do you have on these countries?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I think we have a lot of leverage. I think we have tremendous leverage. I do believe that China, despite my relationship with President Xi\u2014a man who I told you I have great respect for and like, also, a lot. You know, we're having very tough talks on trade. And I think that probably affects China somewhat. But I have to do what I have to do. And I think, over the last 2 months, the border is more open than it was when we first started. But that is what it is. We have to do it. We had a\u2014we have a tremendous deficit in trade, commonly known as a trade deficit. We have a tremendous deficit in trade with China, and we have to do something about it.

For our country, I have to do it.South Korea will do whatever is necessary to get a deal done. And if that means we can't trade, well, then I'm not going to trade. They're definitely not going to trade.

It's unknown territory, in the truest sense. But I really feel confident. I feel that Kim Jong Un wants to do something great for his people, and he has that opportunity. And he won't have that opportunity again. It's never going to be there again.So I really believe that he's going to do something very positive for his people, for himself, his family. He's got an opportunity, the likes of which I think almost\u2014if you look into history\u2014very few people have ever had. He can take that nation, with those great people, and truly make it great. So it's a one-time\u2014it's a one-time shot. And I think it's going to work out very well.That's why I feel positive, because it makes so much sense. And we will watch over, and we'll protect, and we'll do a lot of things. I can say that South Korea, Japan, China, many countries want to see it happen. And they'll help. They'll all help.

How did it go down?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nAnd no subsidies. I even said no tariffs. In other words, let's say Canada\u2014where we have tremendous tariffs\u2014the United States pays tremendous tariffs on dairy. As an example, 270 percent. Nobody knows that. We pay nothing. We don't want to pay anything. Why should we pay?We have to\u2014ultimately, that's what you want. You want a tariff-free, you want no barriers, and you want no subsidies, because you have some cases where countries are subsidizing industries, and that's not fair. So you go tariff-free, you go barrier-free, you go subsidy-free. That's the way you learned at the Wharton School of Finance. I mean, that would be the ultimate thing. Now, whether or not that works\u2014but I did suggest it, and people were\u2014I guess, they're going to go back to the drawing and check it out, right?But we can't have\u2014an example\u2014where we're paying\u2014the United States is paying 270 percent. Just can't have it. And when they send things into us, you don't have that. I will say, it was not contentious. What was strong was the language that this cannot go on. But the relationships are very good, whether it be President Macron or with Justin. We had\u2014Justin did a really good job. I think the relationships were outstanding.But because of the fact that the United States leaders of the past didn't do a good job on trade\u2014and again, I'm not blaming countries, I'm blaming our people that represented our past. It's got to change. It's going to change. I mean, it's not a question of I hope it changes. It's going to change, a hundred percent. And tariffs are going to come way down, because we\u2014people cannot continue to do that. We're like the piggybank that everybody is robbing. And that ends.In fact, Larry Kudlow is a great expert on this, and he's a total free trader. But even Larry has seen the ravages of what they've done with their tariffs. Would you like to say something on that, Larry, very quickly? It might be interesting. One interesting point, in terms of the G-7 group meeting\u2014I don't know if they were surprised with President Trump's free-trade proclamation, but they certainly listened to it and we had lengthy discussions about that. As the President said, all\u2014reduce these barriers. In fact, go to zero: zero tariffs, zero nontariff barriers, zero subsidies.And along the way, we're going to have to clean up the international trading system about which there was virtual consensus of agreement on that. And that will be a target. And these are the best ways to promote economic growth, and we'll all be better at it, and we'll all be stronger at it. So, I myself was particularly gratified to hear my President talk about free trade. Thank you, sir. . Thank you.And it's very unfair to our farmers. Our farmers are, essentially\u2014whether it's through a barrier, nonmonetary barrier, or whether it's through very high tariffs that make it impossible\u2014and this is all over the world. This isn't just G-7. I mean, we have India, where some of the tariffs are a hundred percent. A hundred percent. And we charge nothing. We can't do that. And so we are talking to many countries. We're talking to all countries. And it's going to stop. Or we'll stop trading with them. And that's a very profitable answer, if we have to do it.Yes, sir.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow did it go down?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Mr. President, David Herszenhorn with Politico Europe. Just to come back to Russia for a second. The something that happened that got them kicked out of the G-8 was the invasion and annexation of Crimea.

That was during his administration. And he was the one that let Russia go and spend a lot of money on Crimea, because they've spent a lot of money on rebuilding it. I guess they have their submarine port there and such. But Crimea was let go during the Obama administration. And you know, Obama can say all he wants, but he allowed Russia to take Crimea. I may have had a much different attitude. But\u2014so you'd really have to ask that question to President Obama\u2014you know, why did he do that; why did he do that?

But I have to say, Eliana, that it's going to be something that will always be spur of the moment. You don't know. You know, this has not been done before at this level. This is a leader who really is an unknown personality. People don't know much about him. I think that he's going to surprise on the upside, very much on the upside. We'll see. But never been done. Never been tested. Many people\u2014world leaders\u2014I'm talking about world leaders that have been right next to him have never met him.So we're going in with a very positive spirit, I think, very well prepared. I think\u2014and by the way, we have worked very well with their people. They have many people right now in Shanghai; our people have been\u2014in Singapore. Our people have been working very, very well with the representatives of .So we're going in with a very positive attitude, and I think we're going to come out fine.

Is there a particular outcome that you would look for from this initial talk to judge whether you think things are going well? The President. Well, I think the minimum would be relationship.

But at a minimum, I do believe, at least, we'll have met each other. We will have seen each other.

We shouldn't be in this position. We shouldn't be in this position on tariffs, where we're hundreds of billions of dollars down to other countries that, frankly, were never even negotiated with. They never even got spoken to. I asked a top person in China, how did it get so bad? He looked at me, he said, Nobody ever talked to us.

And I think China wants to see something very good happen, very positive happen. And certainly, South Korea has already stated their intentions.

Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for the Prime Minister as well. Mr. President, under what\u2014you've said repeatedly that you are willing to walk away from the negotiations if they don't do well. Under what exact conditions would you be walking away from that summit? And if the summit does go well, will you be inviting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to the United States?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, the answer is yes to the second part of your question. But certainly, if it goes well. And I think it would be well received. I think he would look at it very favorably. So I think that could happen.All I can say is, I am totally prepared to walk away. I did it once before. You have to be able to walk away. If you're not going to be able to walk away\u2014we didn't walk away from the horrible Iran deal that was signed. And if you look at what's happened since I signed that deal, Iran\u2014and in all fairness, I say it with great respect for the people of Iran\u2014but Iran is acting a lot differently. They're no longer looking so much to the Mediterranean. They're no longer looking so much to what's going on in Syria, what's going on in Yemen and lots of other places. They're a much different country over the last 3 months.And again, I say that with hope that maybe something can happen. But when you mention sanctions, we're putting sanctions on Iran, the likes of which nobody has ever seen before, including, frankly, . That would have been the next phase, if we did it or find it necessary to do.But nuclear to me is always first. And we're going to be fine, with respect to Iran. But we also, Saagar, got something out of it that's very important. A lot of the people that write about this, some of whom I have great respect for, but they haven't picked it up: Iran is not the same country that it was a few months ago. They're a much, much different group of leaders. And I hope at some point they'll come to us and we'll sit down and we'll make a deal that's good for them and good for us and good for everybody. And it will be great for Iran. I expect it to be\u2014I want it to be\u2014great for Iran.But if they would have walked\u2014our side\u2014from some of the horrible provisions that you know as well as I do, and probably everybody sitting here knows, we could have had a great deal. Nothing wrong with a deal, but there's something wrong with that deal. We had a great opportunity to make a phenomenal deal.So I am totally prepared to walk. It could happen. Maybe it won't be necessary. I hope it won't be necessary to walk because I really believe that Kim Jong Un wants to do something that is going to be great for his people and also great for his family and great for himself.Okay?

Mr. Prime Minister, you are the only major world leader not to have a sitdown or a planned sitdown with Kim Jong Un. You hinted in your address today that you would be willing to do so on the matter of abductees. Do you have any plans currently to do so? And would it be focused solely on abductees, or would you be willing to have a separate denuclearization discussion with Kim Jong Un directly without the United States? Thank you.Prime Minister Abe. Of course, on the issue of abduction, we have to resolve this problem. With Abe administration, this is of the highest priority. And if anything contributes to that resolution, if the talk leads to the solution of the problem between U.S. and North Korea or between Japan and North Korea, the meetings we wish to have on the issue of abduction in the final analysis, Chairman Kim Jong Un and between me\u2014between Japan and North Korea, problem has to be solved. Of course, for Japan, missile issue and nuclear issue\u2014very important.Nuclear issue, missile issue, regarding these issues, at the U.S. and North Korea summit meeting, first and foremost, I'm hopeful for the progress. And then, on the issue of abduction, we will liaise\u2014we will collaborate with the U.S. and international community. And Japan, ourselves, must talk directly with North Korea in the final analysis. I am determined about that.Mr. Hayashi?Abduction of Japanese Citizens by North Korea/Release of U.S. Citizens Detained in North Korea  Q. Thank you, Prime Minister Abe. I have question to Prime Minister as well as President Trump. Starting with Prime Minister, you have already mentioned to a certain degree on the abduction issue. In order to hold Japan-North Korea summit, the premise is that you need to obtain results for the abduction issue. What kind of concrete pathway are you envisaging to hold the summit meeting?In your meeting with President Trump today, have you asked President Trump to raise the question of abduction at the U.S.-North Korea summit meeting in Singapore?Next is my question to President Trump. You have\u2014Kim Jong Un has maintained this position that the abduction issue is something that already had been resolved. So what kind of explanation has been given to the United States on the abduction issue in the North Korea to U.S. via consultations? And how should we approach the North Korea in order to seek solution for the abduction? And what did you convey to Prime Minister Abe today in this regard?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYou know, I can speak first because I will tell you, on the Prime Minister's behalf, that he very much talked about abduction.

And I'm just wondering, in your opinion\u2014or of your estimation\u2014what percentage of those people do you believe are deserving of asylum in the U.S.?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I won't get into percentages. But we are a nation of laws. We have to have borders. We don't have borders, we don't have a country. And I've been watching for weeks as the caravan came up. And you know, the Mexican laws are very tough on immigration, extremely tough. And it started out with way over a thousand people\u2014I guess now it's down to about a hundred\u2014going all through Mexico. People don't realize what a big country Mexico is. But it came down by a lot.And now we're working on the border with the worst laws any country\u2014no matter where you go, all over the world, they can't even believe it. And we're doing the best we can with it. But we have to have changes in Congress, and we have to have it quickly. We need a wall, number one. And you see that right now. You know, where they are\u2014even though it's not a particularly good wall and even though a small percentage can climb to the top, they have to be in extremely good shape. But a small percentage can climb that particular wall. We have a wall that's much more difficult.But if you didn't have that, you would have thousands of people just pouring into our country. You've got to have a wall. And we need border security, and we will have border security. As you know, we're sending many, many National Guardsmen down to the border\u2014most of them are already there\u2014and that's having a big impact. But we need a change in the law. Catch-and-release is ridiculous. If they touch our property, if they touch our country, essentially, you catch them, and you release them into our country. That's not acceptable to anybody. So we need a change in the law.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat percentage of those people do you believe are deserving of asylum in the U.S.?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Non-Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}
