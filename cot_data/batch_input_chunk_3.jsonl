And also, did you touch on Afghanistan and the safe withdrawal of troops?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes. Yes, yes, and yes. Let me go back to the first part.The reason it didn't go longer is: When is the last time two heads of state have spent over 2 hours in direct conversation across a table, going into excruciating detail? You may know of a time; I don't. I can't think of one.So we didn't need, as we got through, when we brought in the larger group\u2014our defense, our intelligence, and our foreign\u2014well, our\u2014my Foreign Minister\u2014wasn't the Foreign Minister\u2014my Secretary of State was with me the whole time\u2014our Ambassador, et cetera. We brought everybody in. We had covered so much.And so there was a summary done by him and by me of what we covered. Lavrov and Blinken talked about what we had covered. We raised things that required more amplification or made sure we didn't have any misunderstandings. And so it was, kind of\u2014after 2 hours, there, we looked at each other like, Okay, what next?What is going to happen next is, we're going to be able to look back\u2014look ahead in 3 to 6 months, and say: Did the things we agreed to sit down and try to work out, did it work? Do we\u2014are we closer to a major strategic stability talks and progress? Are we further along in terms of\u2014and go down the line. That's going to be the test.I'm not sitting here saying because the President and I agreed that we would do these things, that all of a sudden, it's going to work. I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is, I think there's a genuine prospect to significantly improve the relations between our two countries without us giving up a single, solitary thing based on principle and/or values.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDid you touch on Afghanistan and the safe withdrawal of troops?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

But it's not because I think he is interested in changing the nature of a closed society or closed government's actions relative to what he thinks is the right of government to do what it does; it's a very different approach.And you know, there's a couple of really good biographies\u2014I told him I read a couple\u2014I read most everything he's written and the speeches he's made. And I've read a couple of very good biographies, which many of you have as well.And I think I pointed out to him that had an opportunity\u2014that brief shining moment after Gorbachev and after things began to change drastically\u2014to actually generate a democratic government. But what happened was, it failed and there was a great, great race among n intellectuals to determine what form of government would they choose and how would they choose it.And based on what I believe, Mr. Putin decided was that has always been a major international power when it's been totally united as a n state, not based on ideology\u2014whether it was going back to Tsar and commissar, straight through to the revolution\u2014the n Revolution, and to where they are today.And I think that it's clear to me\u2014and I've said it\u2014that I think he decided that the way for to be able to sustain itself as a great\u2014quote, great power is to in fact unite the n people on just the strength of the government\u2014the government controls\u2014not necessarily ideologically, but the government.And I think that's the choice that was made. I think it\u2014I'm not going to second guess whether it could have been fundamentally different. But I do think it does not lend itself to maintaining itself as one of the great powers in the world.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAfter your talks with President Putin, how interested do you think he is in improving the media climate in Russia?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, Mr. President. Here at this meeting and earlier at the G-7, you've said several times that America is back at allies' side, but a lot of those allies are themselves pretty rattled by what happened on January 6\u2014an attempted overturning of your election\u2014and they may still be alarmed by the continued hold that Donald Trump has over the Republican Party and the rise of nationalist figures like him around the world.What do you say to those allies, what have you been saying to them at these meetings about how the next President of the United States can keep any promises you make?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWhat I'm saying is them\u2014to them is: Watch me. I mean, I'm not saying anything, quite frankly. I'm just going out\u2014people, as I've said before, don't doubt that I mean what I say, and they believe that I keep my commitments when I say it.I'm not making any promises to anyone that I don't believe are overwhelmingly likely to be kept. I think that we're at a moment where\u2014I mean, let me put it this way: You may have had a different view, but I think an awful lot of people thought that my showing up at the G-7 would not produce any kind of enthusiasm about American leadership and about where America was. I would suggest that it didn't turn out that way.I would suggest that there is a\u2014the leaders I'm dealing with in NATO and the G-7 are leaders who know our recent history; know, generically, the character of the American people; and know where the vast center of the public stands\u2014not Democrat, Republican\u2014but who we are. We're a decent, honorable nation.And I think that they have seen things happen, as we have, that shocked them and surprised them that could have happened. But I think they, like I do, believe the American people are not going to sustain that kind of behavior.And so I\u2014you know, I don't want to get into the statistics, because you know that old phrase of Disraeli's: There's three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics. But I think it's appropriate to say that the Republican Party is vastly diminished in numbers; the leadership of the Republican Party is fractured; and the Trump wing of the party is the bulk of the party, but it makes up a significant minority of the American people.Now, we'll see. We'll see. I believe that by us standing up and saying what we believe to be the case, not engaging in the overwhelming hyperbole that gets engaged in by so many today, that we\u2014I guess that old expression, The proof of the pudding is in the eating.When we said\u2014when I said I was going to deal with beating the virus and I was going to focus on that and I was going to get millions of shots in people's arms, it wasn't me\u2014I just knew the American people. I knew the kind of help I'd get from the Defense Department, from police departments, from the hospitals, from retired docs, from\u2014I just knew. And look how rapidly we moved.Now, we have a group of people who were\u2014everything from the political rejection of the notion of taking a vaccine, to people who were simply afraid of a needle and everything in between. And we have a way to go.But I never doubted that we would be able to generate the kind of support we got and get so many millions of people step up and get vaccinated. So I think it is a shock and surprise that what's happened, in terms of the consequence of President Trump's phony populism, has happened. And it is disappointing that so many of my Republican colleagues in the Senate, who I know know better, have been reluctant to take on, for example, an investigation because they're worried about being primaried.But, at the end of the day, we've been through periods like this in American history before where there has been this reluctance to take a chance on your reelection because of the nature of your party's politics at the moment.I think this is passing. I don't mean easily passing. That's why it's so important that I succeed in my agenda\u2014the agenda, whether it's dealing with the vaccine, the economy, infrastructure. It's important that we demonstrate we can make progress and continue to make progress. And I think we're going to be able to do that.So, as I said, the proof will be in where it is, you know, 6 months from now, where we are. But I think you're going to see that there's\u2014that, God willing, we're going to be making progress, and there's going to be a coalescing of a lot of Republicans, particularly younger Republicans who are coming up in the party. The President. And last question, Sebastian Smith of AFP.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat the President has been saying to allies about how the next President of the United States can keep any promises made\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Well, I appreciate that, sir. Thank you very much. Mr. President, Vladimir Putin\u2014\u2014[At this point, a microphone was brought to Mr. Lemire.] Q. \u2014\u2014thank you. Vladimir Putin, who you'll be seeing in a few days in Geneva, said just a couple of days ago that he believed that U.S.-Russia relations were at a low point. In what concrete ways could your summit change that?And then, secondly, on the same topic: You have said previously, and in the runup to the summit, that you would be unafraid to call out Russia's disruptive actions\u2014like cyber hacks, Ukraine, election interference\u2014but you're not having a joint press conference with Putin. Why not take the chance to stand side by side with him and say those things to him with the world watching?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\n[] Well, let me make it clear: I think he's right it's a low point, and it depends on how he responds to acting consistent with international norms, which, in many cases, he has not.As I told him when I was running and when I got elected, before it was\u2014I was sworn in, that I was going to find out whether or not he, in fact, did engage in trying to interfere in our election; that I was going to take a look at whether he was involved in the\u2014a cybersecurity breach that occurred, et cetera; and if I did, I was going to respond.I did; I checked it out. So I had access to all the intelligence. He was engaged in those activities. I did respond and made it clear that I'd respond again.With regard to\u2014I always found\u2014and I don't mean to suggest that the press should not know\u2014but this is not a contest about who can do better in front of a press conference or try to embarrass each other. It's about making myself very clear what the conditions are to get a better relationship are\u2014with Russia.We're not looking for conflict. We are looking to resolve those actions which we think are inconsistent with international norms, number one. Number two, where we can work together, we may be able to do that in terms of some strategic doctrine that may be able to be worked together. We're ready to do it. And there may be other areas. There's even talk there may be the ability to work together on climate.So the bottom line is that I think the best way to deal with this is for he and I to meet, he and I to have our discussion. I know you don't doubt that I'll be very straightforward\u2014[]\u2014with him about our concerns. And I will make clear my view of how that meeting turned out, and he'll make clear how\u2014from his perspective, how it turned out.But I don't want to get into being diverted by: Did they shake hands? How far did they\u2014who talked the most, and the rest. Now, he can say what he said the meeting was about, and I will say what I think the meeting was about.That's how I'm going to handle it.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhy are you not having a joint press conference with Putin during the summit?

Thank you, sir. On China, you\u2014sorry\u2014China seems to be to doing exactly what it wants to do with regard to Hong Kong, with regard to Xinjiang, with the South China Sea, and many other issues, despite pressure from you and from allies.The final language in the G-7 communiqu\u00e9 does have some mentions of China, which is different from past years, but I know it's not as tough as you and your team wanted it to be. We've saw\u2014we saw a draft of the communiqu\u00e9, and it's not quite as tough.So why isn't it as tough? There isn't very much action in it. There's some calls for China to be respectful. But why isn't that communiqu\u00e9 a little bit tougher? Are you disappointed in that? And what can you do to change some of these actions by China?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, I think it\u2014as you know, last time the G-7 met, there was no mention of China. But this time, there is mention of China. The G-7 explicitly agreed to call out human rights abuses in Xinjiang and in Hong Kong explicitly.Two, to coordinate a common strategy to deal with China nonmarket policies that undermine competition. They've agreed\u2014and that's underway now\u2014how to do that.Three, to take serious actions against forced labor in solar, agriculture, and the garment industries because that's where it's happening. And they've agreed we will do that.To launch\u2014what I said earlier; I really feel very strongly\u2014I proposed that we have a democratic alternative to the Belt and Road Initiative: the Build Back Better. And they've agreed to that, and that's underway as the details of that\u2014we agreed that we'd put together a committee to do that and come up with that. And thirdly, that we are going to insist on a high-standards to be\u2014for a climate-friendly, transparent alternative to the Belt and Road Initiative. And\u2014but, in the meantime, we're going to move forward.Look, I think it's always\u2014let me put it this way: I know this is going sound somewhat prosaic, but I think we're in a contest, not with China per se, but a contest with autocrats, autocratic governments around the world, as to whether or not democracies can compete with them in the rapidly changing 21st century.And I think how we act and whether we pull together as democracies is going to determine whether our grandkids look back 15 years from now and say, Did they step up? Are democracies as relevant and as powerful as they have been?And I walked away from the meeting with all my colleagues believing that they are convinced that that is correct now too. Not\u2014I shouldn't say now. Not just because of me, but they believe that to be the case.And so I think you're going to see just straightforward dealing with China. And again, we're not looking\u2014as I've told Xi Jinping myself, I'm not looking for conflict. Where we can cooperate, we'll cooperate. Where we disagree, I'm going to state it frankly, and we are going to respond to actions that are inconsistent.For example, we talked about trade. It's one thing to talk about whether or not our agricultural policy makes sense. It's another thing to say: By the way, you're demanding that if I do business with your country, I've got to give you all my trade secrets and have the Chinese partner have 51 percent of that? No. Not us.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat can be done to change some of China's actions?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, sir. Just to follow up on Jennifer's question: The communiqu\u00e9 cited a variety of fronts on China, everything from human rights, the origin of the COVID virus, Taiwan. What do you think China needs to do to ease tensions?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI think China has to start to act more responsibly in terms of international norms on human rights and transparency.Transparency matters across the board. And I think the idea that\u2014for example, one of the things I raised and others raised\u2014I wasn't the only one who raised this at the G-7\u2014is that we don't know\u2014we haven't had access to the laboratories to determine whether or not\u2014and I have not reached a conclusion because our intelligence community is not certain yet whether or not this was a consequence of a\u2014from the marketplace of a bat, you know, interfacing with animals in the environment that caused this COVID-19 or whether it was an experiment gone awry in a laboratory.It's important to know the answer to that because we have to have access\u2014we have to build a system whereby we can know what\u2014when we see another transparent\u2014lack of transparency that might produce another pandemic. We have to have access. The world has to have access.So we're trying to figure out, the G-7, whether we could put together an international basis upon which we could have a bottom line with what the transparency accounted for.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat do you think China needs to do to ease tensions?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Mr. President, thank you very much. About Vladimir Putin and your meeting this week: As you're well aware, the U.S. has been slapping sanctions on Russia for years for its malign activities, and Russia has not stopped. So what specifically will you do differently to change Vladimir Putin's behavior?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, there's no guarantee you can change a person's behavior or the behavior of his country. Autocrats have enormous power, and they don't have to answer to a public. And the fact is that it may very well be, if I respond in kind\u2014which I will\u2014that it doesn't dissuade him; he wants to keep going.But I think that we're going to be moving in a direction where Russia has its own dilemmas, let us say, dealing with its economy, dealing with its\u2014dealing with COVID, and dealing with not only the United States, but Europe writ large and in the Middle East.And so there's a lot going on where we can work together with Russia. For example, in Libya, we should be opening up the passes to be able to go through and provide food assistance and economic\u2014I mean, vital assistance to a population that's in real trouble.I think I'm going to try very much\u2014hard to\u2014it is\u2014and by the way, there's places where\u2014I shouldn't be starting off on negotiating in public here. But let me say it this way: Russia has engaged in activities which are\u2014we believe are contrary to international norms, but they have also bitten off some real problems they're going to have trouble chewing on.And, for example, the rebuilding of Syria, of Libya, of\u2014you know, this is\u2014they're there. And as long as they're there without the ability to bring about some order in the region, and you can't do that very well without providing for the basic economic needs of people.So I'm hopeful that we can find an accommodation that\u2014where we can save the lives of people in\u2014for example, in Libya, that\u2014consistent with the interest of\u2014maybe for different reasons\u2014but reached it for the same reason\u2014the same result.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nThe U.S. has been slapping sanctions on Russia for years for its malign activities, and Russia has not stopped.

He's never broken his word to me.And\u2014but what I've made clear is that it's essential\u2014it's essential\u2014that the Palestinians in\u2014on the West Bank be secured, that Abbas be recognized as a leader of the Palestinian people, which he is.

Good afternoon. I'm from Korea Herald. My name is Lee Ji-yoon. The Korean people are very curious about vaccines, and they're waiting for the good news regarding vaccine. I understand that you've had a lot of discussions with President Biden regarding vaccine, and I wonder whether you have any good news to deliver to the people of Korea. And has there been any meaningful achievement that you want to go into the details of?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes. Regarding vaccine cooperation, you can read the joint statements and also the remarks that were issued as press release today. But, to emphasize it once again, between the U.S. and Korea for vaccine cooperation, there will be a comprehensive partnership to be established between our two nations, and there has been an agreement between our two sides on that.The U.S. has the ability to develop vaccines, and Korean companies have the capacity to produce a biomedicine. And we are going to combine those capabilities so that we can boost vaccine supply, so that we can accelerate the rollout of vaccines to the entire world, especially in the Indo-Pacific region. For supplying vaccines to that region, I believe that we'll be able to make a contribution in that regard.And in that process, Korea, in my opinion, will get some help in stabilizing our vaccine supply. And at the same time, for the sake of the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance, President Biden decided to provide vaccines to the servicemen in Korea as soon as the U.S. is ready. I understand there will be an announcement to be made by the U.S. side. By the way, I can just prematurely make that. And we're going\u2014there are 550,000 Korean soldiers, sailors, airmen who work in close contact with American forces in Korea. We'll provide full vaccinations for all 550,000 of those Korean forces engaging with American forces on a regular basis, both for their sake, as well as the sake of the American forces.In addition to that, we've talked about the ability to have vaccines produced with our\u2014working with\u2014and this is in the offing\u2014working with one of the major vaccine producers in the United States and to\u2014where Korea is incredibly sophisticated. And with the help of that particular company, we'll be able to make significant numbers of vaccines for themselves.And lastly, it is my hope and expectation\u2014I cannot commit to it because we don't know for certain\u2014but we think that, over the remainder of 2021, we're going to be able to vaccinate every American. We have enough vaccine to vaccinate every American, period, right now. And we're going to be able to do that by the mid-summer, and we're going to continue to get more people to engage in seeking the vaccine. I don't believe\u2014I never have believed\u2014that there's a large percentage of Americans who will not take the vaccine. And we're doing very imaginative things, and the States are, to get people to show up and have the vaccine.But we believe\u2014we believe\u2014that, between the second half of 2021 and going in through 2022, we can produce as many as another billion doses of vaccine. Because it's not just\u2014and this is what I like about this President\u2014he's not just talking about it, any more than I'm just talking about the United States or just Korea; he's talking about the Indo-Pacific. He's talking about the world.We, with advanced capabilities, have an obligation to do everything we can to provide for protection of the entire world. I know that is an awfully, awfully, awfully ambitious proposal, but I think the nations that have that capacity are going to be continuing to work toward getting that done.And so thank you.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nNews on vaccine cooperation and achievements:\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Tajiri, Kyodo News. At Camp David with history. I do have a question to each of the leaders.Mr. President Biden\u2014President Biden, it was mentioned at this summit meeting that Russia's aggression of Ukraine is continuing. So what role do you expect of Japan?Prime Minister Kishida has mentioned that as China's threat in Asia is rising, Ukraine may be East Asia tomorrow. What do you think about this comment, President Biden?And the situation in Asia, where China's threat is rising, what is the meaning and significance of the trilateral relationship with Japan, U.S., R.O.K. becoming stronger in multiple layers?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNorth Korea's nuclear missile development is a major security threat to Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. As North Korea's provocations continue to escalate, what is the meaning and significance of the three countries declaring a new era of partnership?Regarding the release of treated water at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, did Prime Minister Kishida explain the matter at the trilateral or the bilateral summit today?To the recent Japan-R.O.K. summit meeting, Your Excellency, you expressed your intent to respect the IAEA report despite the strong domestic opposition. Why do you demonstrate your understanding for the policy of Kishida administration? I ask for that reason.And to Prime Minister Kishida, this is the first time that a trilateral summit is held on a stand-alone basis rather than on the sidelines of international meetings. You have said that the trilateral cooperation will be raised to new heights for the security environment in East Asia. And without the resolution of abduction, North Korea is continuing nuclear missile development. What is the meaning for North Korea?And in East and South Seas, by maritime advancement, is continuing unilateral attempts to change the status quo. What is the meaning for ? And you have a great imagination. One question ends up being six. But thank you. [] I'll try to answer all of it. [] I'm glad I didn't have you as my law professor when he said one question. [] At any rate, they're all legitimate questions.Look, on Ukraine, I and my country and the leadership of my country in both parties are very grateful for everything Japan is helping to deal with in Ukraine. And I mean that sincerely. You've showed strong leadership through the G-7 as well and contributed to a significant amount of financial and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, as well as nonlethal military equipment.And you know\u2014and they joined so many other nations in holding Russia accountable through their international sanctions.If my memory serves me well\u2014and I think it does, Mr. Prime Minister\u2014we found ourselves in a circumstance where, when I called you about Ukraine, I didn't have to convince you of anything. I started off to make the case that Ukraine was a circumstance where\u2014to think, in the first quarter of the 20th century, another country would amass over 150,000 forces on the border of another country\u2014or 150,000 forces and invade that country\u2014invade that country without any rationale other than\u2014if you read Putin's speech after he invaded, he talked about Kyiv being the motherland.You know, I mean, it just was ridiculous, I think.

If we stand\u2014if we had stood still, what signal would that send to about Taiwan? What signal would that send around the world if nations weren't powerful on borders?But here's the deal. You contributed significantly to what, I think, is already the\u2014let me put it this way. Russia has already lost. It cannot meet its original objective which it stated. It's not possible.But\u2014and they've joined so many other nations in holding Russia accountable for international sanctions. But Japan's leadership, from day one, that has been critical for making it clear that the consequences for war extend well beyond Europe\u2014well beyond Europe.I say it in reverse. What would happen if an Asian country with 150,000 troops invaded another? You think that would not affect the interests, the economy, and the foreign policy of nations in Europe and Latin America all across the world? It would have profound impact.And with Japan's leadership, from day one, it has been critical to making clear the consequences of this will extend well beyond Europe\u2014well beyond Europe. It's a global issue that has impacts everywhere. And the Prime Minister's comments at Shangri-La capture that.And by the way, you know, we talked about this being an inflection point. The world is changing. The world is changing. And about every six or seven generations, it makes significant change. And there's a lot happening.And the idea that we're going to sit down, the rest of the world, and say, Well, that's only a European problem. There hasn't been that kind of invasion since World War II.And so\u2014as for peace, we all want that, of course. Ukrainians want it most of all.

Tajiri, Kyodo News. At Camp David with history. I do have a question to each of the leaders.Mr. President Biden\u2014President Biden, it was mentioned at this summit meeting that Russia's aggression of Ukraine is continuing. So what role do you expect of Japan?Prime Minister Kishida has mentioned that as China's threat in Asia is rising, Ukraine may be East Asia tomorrow. What do you think about this comment, President Biden?And the situation in Asia, where China's threat is rising, what is the meaning and significance of the trilateral relationship with Japan, U.S., R.O.K. becoming stronger in multiple layers?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNorth Korea's nuclear missile development is a major security threat to Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. As North Korea's provocations continue to escalate, what is the meaning and significance of the three countries declaring a new era of partnership?Regarding the release of treated water at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, did Prime Minister Kishida explain the matter at the trilateral or the bilateral summit today?To the recent Japan-R.O.K. summit meeting, Your Excellency, you expressed your intent to respect the IAEA report despite the strong domestic opposition. Why do you demonstrate your understanding for the policy of Kishida administration? I ask for that reason.And to Prime Minister Kishida, this is the first time that a trilateral summit is held on a stand-alone basis rather than on the sidelines of international meetings. You have said that the trilateral cooperation will be raised to new heights for the security environment in East Asia. And without the resolution of abduction, North Korea is continuing nuclear missile development. What is the meaning for North Korea?And in East and South Seas, by maritime advancement, is continuing unilateral attempts to change the status quo. What is the meaning for ? And you have a great imagination. One question ends up being six. But thank you. [] I'll try to answer all of it. [] I'm glad I didn't have you as my law professor when he said one question. [] At any rate, they're all legitimate questions.Look, on Ukraine, I and my country and the leadership of my country in both parties are very grateful for everything Japan is helping to deal with in Ukraine. And I mean that sincerely. You've showed strong leadership through the G-7 as well and contributed to a significant amount of financial and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, as well as nonlethal military equipment.And you know\u2014and they joined so many other nations in holding Russia accountable through their international sanctions.If my memory serves me well\u2014and I think it does, Mr. Prime Minister\u2014we found ourselves in a circumstance where, when I called you about Ukraine, I didn't have to convince you of anything. I started off to make the case that Ukraine was a circumstance where\u2014to think, in the first quarter of the 20th century, another country would amass over 150,000 forces on the border of another country\u2014or 150,000 forces and invade that country\u2014invade that country without any rationale other than\u2014if you read Putin's speech after he invaded, he talked about Kyiv being the motherland.You know, I mean, it just was ridiculous, I think. And he talked about being Peter the Great. It was\u2014just imagine if we had done nothing. Imagine if we had done nothing.And the point was immediately recognized, if I'm not mistaken, by you, Mr. Prime Minister, that we're in a situation where it could happen anywhere. If we stand\u2014if we had stood still, what signal would that send to about Taiwan? What signal would that send around the world if nations weren't powerful on borders?But here's the deal. You contributed significantly to what, I think, is already the\u2014let me put it this way. Russia has already lost. It cannot meet its original objective which it stated. It's not possible.But\u2014and they've joined so many other nations in holding Russia accountable for international sanctions. But Japan's leadership, from day one, that has been critical for making it clear that the consequences for war extend well beyond Europe\u2014well beyond Europe.I say it in reverse. What would happen if an Asian country with 150,000 troops invaded another? You think that would not affect the interests, the economy, and the foreign policy of nations in Europe and Latin America all across the world? It would have profound impact.And with Japan's leadership, from day one, it has been critical to making clear the consequences of this will extend well beyond Europe\u2014well beyond Europe. It's a global issue that has impacts everywhere. And the Prime Minister's comments at Shangri-La capture that.And by the way, you know, we talked about this being an inflection point. The world is changing. The world is changing. And about every six or seven generations, it makes significant change. And there's a lot happening.And the idea that we're going to sit down, the rest of the world, and say, Well, that's only a European problem. There hasn't been that kind of invasion since World War II.And so\u2014as for peace, we all want that, of course. Ukrainians want it most of all. And my team has been working very closely with the\u2014President Zelenskyy's team and further peace formula, noting that nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. But nonetheless, we're meeting with them constantly\u2014constantly.And your other two questions about \u2014I'll just say this: This summit was not about . That was not the purpose of the meeting. But it did come\u2014 obviously came up. Not to say we don't share concerns about the economic coercion or heightened tensions caused by , but this summit was really about our relationship with each other and deepening cooperation across an entire range of issues that went well beyond just the immediate issues we raised.It was about more peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific, a region, quite frankly, that would benefit everyone living there and around the world if we get it right. It's not just here. It has a phenomenal impact.Think about what's going\u2014at any rate, I won't get going. I'll take too long. []But as you've seen from the initiatives we're announcing here, today is just how committed we are to see this vision take place. And I think this relationship that we've put together and I think we're going to\u2014you're going to see it expand. It's not merely what we did today. This is a historic meeting.But we're about to\u2014we've laid in place a long-term structure for a relationship that will last and have a phenomenal impact not just in Asia, but around the world.Someone once said in a different context that\u2014about a health care provision in my country a while ago: This is a big deal.

You'll come face to face with many of those leaders at the same moment that your predecessor is considering launching his reelection effort. How should those world leaders, both good guys and bad guys, view this moment both for America and for your Presidency?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, these world leaders know we're doing better than anybody else in the world, as a practical matter. Notwithstanding the difficulties we have, our economy is growing. You saw the last report; we're still growing at 2.6 percent. We're creating jobs. We're still in a solid position. And there's not many other countries in the world that are in that position.And I promise you, from the telephone calls I still have and from the meetings I have with other heads of State, they're looking to the United States and saying: How are you doing it? And what are you doing? What can we do together? How\u2014so I think that the vast majority of my colleagues\u2014at least those colleagues who are NATO members\u2014European Union, Japan, South Korea, et cetera\u2014I think they're looking to cooperate and wanting to know how we can help one another.And what was the other question?\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow should world leaders, both good and bad, view this moment both for America and for your Presidency?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

So, you know, when the war will end, I hope it ends sooner than later.But for it to end, they have to be in a position where the Ukrainians have all that they can reasonably expect, we can reasonably expect to get to them, in order to provide for their physical security and their defenses.And so one does not relate to the other. They need\u2014we're going to be providing another\u2014well, I guess I'll announce it shortly, but another $800 billion\u2014$800 million in aid for additional weaponry, including\u2014you know, weapons\u2014including air defense system, as well as offensive weapons.

Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. Mr. President, in your last press conference, you said successful Presidents prioritize and that you were focusing your agenda on one thing at a time. And I'd like to just ask you: What would you say to many Americans who voted for you about the legislative progress on gun control and police reform having to wait while you pursue infrastructure, given that we continue to see these incidents with mass shootings and also police-involved shootings, including the incident that a lot of us saw in Chicago most recently? Do you feel any need to reprioritize your agenda?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI've never not prioritized this. No one has worked harder to deal with the violence used by individuals using weapons than I have. I'm the only one ever to have passed an assault weapons ban. I'm the only one that ever got a 10-year ban on assault weapons and clips of more than 10 bullets.Immediately upon us becoming in office, having an Attorney General, I asked him to put together the things I could do by Executive order, including dealing with new guns that can be made\u2014you can buy in pieces and put together, and other initiatives.I strongly support\u2014I strongly support\u2014the universal background checks, which I continue to push. The Congress has to step up and act. The Senate has to act. And I strongly support and continue\u2014I've never stopped supporting the ban on assault weapons and magazines that hold more than 10 bullets.It doesn't mean that I can't also be working at the same time on the economy and on COVID. But it's not a question of my being able to set the agenda in the Senate as to what they will move to first. And so I continue and I strongly, strongly urge my Republican friends in the Congress who even refused to bring up the House-passed bill to bring it up now.This has to end. It's a national embarrassment. It is a national embarrassment what's going on. And it's not only these mass shootings that are occurring. Every single day\u2014every single day, there's a mass shooting in this United\u2014in the United States if you count all those who are killed out on the streets of our cities and our rural areas. It's a national embarrassment and must come to an end.And one last thing: The folks who own weapons, the folks who own guns, they support universal background checks. The majority of them think we should not be selling assault weapons. Who, in God's name, needs a weapon that can hold 100 rounds or 40 rounds or 20 rounds? It's just wrong. And I'm not going to give up until it's done.You have a question you want to offer? I mean, not a question\u2014[]\u2014recognize someone, Mr. Prime Minister.

Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned your progress on COVID-19. I'd like to ask you about some of the other issues facing your Presidency. One of the defining challenges you face in the coming months is how to deliver on your promise to Americans on issues like immigration reform, gun control, voting rights, climate change. All of those right now are facing stiff, united opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill. How far are you willing to go to achieve those promises that you made to the American people?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I'm going to\u2014look, when I took office, I decided that it was a fairly basic, simple proposition, and that is: I got elected to solve problems. And the most urgent problem facing the American people, I stated from the outset, was COVID-19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of Americans. And so that's why I put all my focus in the beginning\u2014there are a lot of problems\u2014put all my focus on dealing with those particular problems.And the other problems we're talking about, from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned, are long-term problems; they've been around a long time. And what we're going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well, and\u2014whether it's immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country.But the fundamental problem is getting people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling wondering whether they lost their health insurance, whether they're going to lose a family member, whether they're going to be in a position where they're not going to be\u2014they're going to lose their home because they can't pay their mortgage, or that millions of people are going to get thrown out of their homes because of the inability to pay their rent.So we're going to move on these one at a time, try to do as many simultaneously as we can. But that's the reason why I focused as I have.And here's the deal: I think my Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together, or they decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to just decide to divide the country, continue the politics of division. But I'm not going to do that; I'm just going to move forward and take these things as they come.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow far are you willing to go to achieve those promises that you made to the American people?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

His mother says that she sent her son to this country because she believes that you are not deporting unaccompanied minors like her son. That's why she sent him alone from Honduras.So, sir, you blamed the last administration, but is your messaging\u2014in saying that these children are and will be allowed to stay in this country and work their way through this process\u2014encouraging families like Yossell's to come?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, look, the idea that I'm going to say\u2014which I would never do\u2014if an unaccompanied child ends up at the border, we're just going to let him starve to death and stay on the other side\u2014no previous administration did that either, except Trump. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it.That's why I've asked the Vice President of the United States, yesterday, to be the lead person on dealing with focusing on the fundamental reasons why people leave Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador in the first place. It's because of earthquakes, floods. It's because of lack of food. It's because of gang violence. It's because of a whole range of things.That\u2014when I was Vice President and had the same obligation to deal with unaccompanied children, I was able to get it slowed up significantly by working with the heads of state of those communities to do things like\u2014in one of the major cities, the reason people were leaving is, they couldn't walk in the street because they were getting\u2014their kids were getting beat up or shot or in gang violence.Well, what I was able to do is not give money to the head of state, because so many are corrupt, but I was able to say: Okay, you need lighting in the streets to change things? I'll put the lighting in. We've got a contractor. We've got the type of lighting. We paid directly to the contractor; it did not go through the Government. And violent crime significantly was reduced in that city. Fewer people sought to leave.When this hurricane occurred\u2014two hurricanes\u2014instead of us going down and helping in a major way so that people would not have reason to want to leave in the first place because they didn't have housing or water or sustenance, we did nothing. We're going to do a lot in our administration. We're going to be spending that 700-plus million dollars a year to change the life and circumstances of why people leave in the first place.That mother did not sit around with\u2014on the kitchen table and say: You know, I've got a great idea: The way I'm going to make sure my son get taken care of is, I'm going to put a\u2014how old was he, or she?\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nIs the messaging of allowing children to stay in the country encouraging families like Yossell's to come?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about Afghanistan. You face a May 1 deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from that country. As a candidate, in Foreign Affairs, you wrote that it is past time to end these forever wars. Can you commit to the American people that by May 2 the U.S. will no longer have forces in Afghanistan?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThe answer is that it's going to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline. Just in terms of tactical reasons, it's hard to get those troops out. So what we've been doing\u2014what I've been doing and what Secretary Blinken has been doing\u2014has been\u2014we've been meeting with our allies, those other nations that have\u2014NATO allies who have troops in Afghanistan as well. And if we leave, we're going to do so in a safe and orderly way.We're in consultation, I said, with our allies and partners in how to proceed. And Secretary Blinken is meeting in Brussels this week with our NATO allies, particularly those who have forces there.And General Austin is\u2014just met with Kayani [Ghani]* and I'm waiting for the briefing on that. He is the leader, quote, in Afghanistan and Kabul. And there's a U.N.-led process that's beginning shortly on how to mechanically get people\u2014how to end this war.But it is not my intention to stay there for a long time. But the question is: How and in what circumstances do we meet that agreement that was made by President Trump to leave under a deal that looks like it's not being able to be worked out to begin with? How is that done?

Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about your relationship with China now that you've been in office for a couple months. There's obviously the meeting in Alaska that was a little theatrical, and there's the continued human rights abuses.So today I'm wondering: Are you more likely than you were when you came into office to maintain tariffs on China? Are you considering banning imports of forced-labor products? And would you consider cutting off U.S. investment or Chinese access to international payment systems?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, look, they're each specifically legitimate questions, but they only touch a smidgen of what the relationship with China really is about.I've known Xi Jinping for a long time. Allegedly, by the time I left office as Vice President, I had spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader had, because President Obama and the Chinese President Hu decided we should get to know one another since it was inappropriate for the President of the United States to spend time with the Vice President of another country. But it was obvious he was going to become the new leader of China.So I spent hours upon hours with him alone with an interpreter\u2014my interpreter and his\u2014going into great detail. He is very, very straightforward. Doesn't have a democratic\u2014with a small D\u2014bone in his body. But he's a smart, smart guy. He's one of the guys, like Putin, who thinks that autocracy is the wave of the future and democracy can't function in an ever\u2014an ever-complex world.So, when I was elected and he called to congratulate me, I think to the surprise of the China experts who were\u2014his people were on the call as well as mine, listening\u2014we had a 2-hour conversation. For 2 hours. And we made several things clear to one another. I made it clear to him again what I've told him in person on several occasions: that we're not looking for confrontation, although we know there will be steep, steep competition.Two, that we'll have strong competition, but we'll insist that China play by the international rules: fair competition, fair practices, fair trade.Thirdly, in order to compete effectively, I indicated that we're going to deal with China effectively, and we're going to need three things to do that. I tell him, our people. First, we're going to invest in American workers and American science. I said that all through the campaign and I say it again. And we're\u2014and I'm setting up my administration to be able to do that, which is that, you know, back in the sixties, we used to invest a little over 2 percent of our entire GDP in pure research and investment in science. Today, it's 0.7 percent. I'm going to change that. We're going to change that.The future lies in who can, in fact, own the future as it relates to technology, quantum computing, a whole range of things, including in medical fields. And so what I'm going to do is make sure we invest closer to 2 percent.One of the reasons why I've set up the\u2014the PAB [PCAST]*\u2014the President's board with scientists and the like, again\u2014is we're going to invest in medical research\u2014cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, the things\u2014industries of the future\u2014artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotech. And we're going to make real investments. China is outinvesting us by a long shot, because their plan is to own that future.The third\u2014the second thing we're going to do is, we're going to reestablish our alliances. And I've been very clear with him, it's not anti-Chinese. And we've talked about it.I want to make sure that, for example, later today, after this\u2014as a matter of fact, shortly after this, which is fine; we've been going close to an hour. I'm happy to go longer. But one of the things that I'm going to be doing, I'm going to be speaking with the 27 heads of state in Europe and very shortly\u2014I think within the next hour or so. I don't know the exact time.And earlier this month\u2014and apparently, it got the Chinese's attention; that's not why I did it\u2014I met with our allies and how we're going to hold China accountable in the region: Australia, India, Japan, and the United States\u2014the so-called Quad. Because we have to have democracies working together.Before too long, I'm going to have\u2014I'm going to invite an alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future. And so we're going to make it clear that in order to deal with these things, we are going to hold China accountable to follow the rules\u2014to follow the rules\u2014whether it relates to the South China Sea or the North China Sea or their agreement made on Taiwan or a whole range of other things.And the third thing, and the thing that I admire about dealing with with Xi is, he understands\u2014he makes no pretense about not understanding what I'm saying any more than I do him\u2014I pointed out to him: No leader can be sustained in his position or her position unless they represent the values of the country. And I said as\u2014And, Mr. President, as I've told you before, Americans value the notion of freedom. America values human rights. We don't always live up to our expectations, but it's a value system. We are founded on that principle. And as long as you and your country continues to so blatantly violate human rights, we're going to continue, in an unrelenting way, to call it to the attention of the world and make it clear\u2014make it clear\u2014what's happening.And he understood that. I made it clear that no American President\u2014at least one did\u2014but no American President ever back down from speaking out of what's happening to the Uyghurs, what's happening in Hong Kong, what's happening in-country. That's who we are. The moment a President walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world. It's who we are.So I see stiff competition with China. China has an overall goal, and I don't criticize them for the goal, but they have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world. That's not going to happen on my watch, because the United States are going to continue to grow and expand.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAre you more likely than you were when you came into office to maintain tariffs on China?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

And there's ways to do that. There's ways to do that\u2014a little bit like determining whether or not you've got the right code for your credit card, you know? What was your dog's name? kind of a thing. I'm being a bit facetious, but not really. And also seeking harder data, from DNA to birth certificates, which takes longer.So I want to do this as quickly as humanly possible and as safely as possible.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nExpectations for improved contact, expediency, and processing at the border.\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

As you well know, treating the root causes in Latin America doesn't change things overnight. How do you realistically and physically keep these families from coming to the U.S. when things will not get better in their countries right away?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I can't guarantee that. But I know, you know, that old thing: The journey of 1,000 miles starts with the first step.You know as well as I do; you cover it: You have serious\u2014it's not like somebody at a sitting hand-hewn table in Guatemala\u2014I mean, in somewhere in Mexico or in Guadalupe, saying: I've got a great idea. Let's sell everything we have. Give it to a coyote. Have him take our kids across the border and into a desert where they don't speak the language. Won't that be fun? Let's go. That's not how it happens. People don't want to leave.When my great-grandfather got on a coffin ship in the Irish Sea, expectation was: Was he going to live long enough on that ship to get to the United States of America? But they left because of what the Brits had been doing. They were in real, real trouble. They didn't want to leave. But they had no choice. So you've got\u2014we can't\u2014I can't guarantee we're going to solve everything, but I can guarantee we can make everything better. We can make it better. We can change the lives of so many people.And the other thing I want to point out to you and I hope you point out: I realize it's much more heart wrenching\u2014and it is\u2014to deal with a 5- and 6- and 7-year-old. But you went down there, and you saw: The vast majority of these children\u201470 percent\u2014are 16 years old, 17 years old, and mostly males. Doesn't make it\u2014that doesn't make it good, bad, or indifferent. But the idea that we have tens of thousands of kids in these God-awful facilities that are, really, little babies crying all night\u2014and there's some; that's true. That's why we've got to act.And yesterday I asked my team\u2014both the Director of the two agencies, as well as others\u2014I asked them what would they, in fact\u2014and I asked their opinion because they're the experts\u2014but I said, Focus on the most vulnerable immediately.But there's no reason why, in the next month, as people cross the border, that phone call can't be made in the first 48 hours and begin.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow do you realistically and physically keep these families from coming to the U.S. when things will not get better in their countries right away?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

And that's on very short notice. All of those people are watching. You know, we have eyes and ears now that we wouldn't have had if we didn't bring it up.So no, I'm sure she's watching, and I'm sure that everybody is looking at it.

Thank you, sir. Democrats are arguing that ACB puts in danger not only Roe v. Wade, but a number of other decisions. Do you think that they are correct?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNo, I don't know. I mean, you know, it would depend. I think she's going to rule on the law. I think she's going to be a great Justice for many years to come.But I can say they also bring up health care. I mean, Obamacare is terrible. It doesn't work. We've made the best of it. We got rid of the individual mandate, which is great. We protect people with\u2014we are going to protect people with preexisting conditions, 100 percent. But if we can end Obamacare and come up with a much better health care system that's much cheaper\u2014much cheaper\u2014and much better, which is what we'll do. On the other hand, if the Court rules against, we will manage the system better. But don't forget, we've already essentially gotten rid of Obamacare, because we got rid of the individual mandate, and it was all based on that. So we've done a tremendous amount because the individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare. You had to pay a lot of money for the privilege of not paying for bad health care. So that was a terrible thing for people.And what we will do is, if we are fortunate enough to get rid of the little remaining in Obamacare\u2014and again, individual mandate, the way I view it, that's no longer Obamacare, because that was the central point, and we won that; we've already won that, as you know. But by getting rid of that, it's different. It's a much different thing.The other thing we've done is managed\u2014here's the story: It's no good. It's too expensive. It's bad coverage. You don't get your doctor. You don't get your plan. All the things that President Obama said, you don't get. And Biden too, by the way, if Biden even\u2014I don't think he has any understanding of it.But you don't get your doctor. You don't get your plan. Twenty-eight times, President Obama said: You get your doctor. You get your plan. It turned out to be a lie.So here's what we're doing: If we can terminate, we are going to have a much better plan, and you will have your doctor, you will have your plan. You'll have a lot of things that you don't get with Obamacare.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDemocrats are arguing that ACB puts in danger not only Roe v.

Sometimes, you can go too much.I mean, look, I've had\u2014I'd never debated before, but then I debated a lot 4 years ago. And if you look at the polls\u2014those polls that come out\u2014hundreds of thousands of people in TIME magazine and all of the different polls; I think there's about seven or eight of them\u2014according to those polls, I won every debate\u2014every single debate, in the primaries and then when I debated Crooked Hillary. I won every debate.I mean, this isn't me saying\u2014I felt I did\u2014but this isn't me saying it; this is the polls. You had a TIME magazine poll. You had this, that. And I guess they take them off the internet or they get phone calls or something. But according to that, I won every debate, and I felt I did. But I understand the subject. Now, Chris is tough. I hope that Chris is going to be equally tough on Joe Biden. But I watched the young lady, who I won't\u2014I won't say her name, but it was embarrassing the way she was getting him along.So I just asked the question about drugs. I think it's something that would be appropriate, because you can't have a President that needs that kind of help.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nIs it more or less than '16?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

That may be one. I mean, the son didn't have a job. He had some big difficulties. And then, all of the sudden, he's making millions of dollars as soon as his father becomes Vice President. No, I think that'll come up. I don't think Joe can answer it, frankly. I think there's only one reason he made all that money.And then, you have to say: What about Joe's involvement? And why did Joe not give the billion dollars over to Ukraine, as an example, until such time as they let go of a Prosecutor that was investigating the company that his son was involved with?I mean, there are some bad questions. I don't think they have answers. And if we had a media that was fair\u2014even just reasonable\u2014this would be the biggest story for years and years and years. Then, you'd really be entitled to real Pulitzer Prizes, not the fake committee that gives you these fake awards.So, I mean, it's a really fair question. But it's hard to believe, when you see the kind of money that he has made from China, from Russia, where the wife of the mayor of Moscow gives him $3\u00bd million and nobody even has any question about it.Why did he get $3\u00bd million? I'll tell you why: Because Joe Biden was in on it. Joe was in on it. There's no way that he wasn't. And uses Joe Biden's plane\u2014Air Force Two. Uses Joe\u2014and they go to China, and then he comes back, and he never mentioned it to his father that he just got a billion and a half dollars?And now it's turning out that it's much more money than that, Rudy. It's true. . It's turned out to be much more money from China. They have\u2014a member of the Chinese Communist Party gave him a lot of money. And the press has no interest in these stories.

It just came out. I mean, I didn't know about Moscow: $3\u00bd million from the mayor's wife. I didn't know about that. And he's a very influential, powerful man in Russia, as you know. And it wasn't me; I didn't have anything to do with Russia. That came out loud and clear.What also came out is they should have never gone into this fake Mueller investigation. And it also came out that the 31 phones that were wiped clean shouldn't have been wiped clean. And that's a criminal act.And Bloomberg likewise shouldn't be paying for prisoners to go\u2014in Florida\u2014go and vote, because he's basically paying\u2014which is totally illegal\u2014going and paying prisoners.
