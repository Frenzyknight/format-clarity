These elements implicitly convey a general approach or intention: maintain responsibility for the population, delegitimize Hamas\u2019s rule, and seek a reversal of the coup under international and Arab peace terms. On the other hand, he does not explicitly answer the core specifics the question demands: he does not clearly describe a concrete mechanism for \u201cgetting control\u201d of Gaza (no clear security, political, or diplomatic plan) and does not directly state whether he believes this can be achieved by the end of the year or by the end of Bush\u2019s presidency.
