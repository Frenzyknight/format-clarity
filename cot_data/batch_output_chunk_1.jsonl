These are explicit elements of the way ahead. \\n  \u2022 Launching and leading global initiatives: International Solar Alliance, helping island countries with solar, CDRI (for resilient infrastructure), and Mission LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment) to promote pro-environment lifestyles globally. These describe how he sees global and domestic pathways forward. \\n- Crucially, he explicitly addresses the question\u2019s concern about technology and finance: \u201cthere\u2019s always been talk about technology transfer, financial support\u2026 there are some countries that need to have technology transfer, financial support. And we hope that as soon as we can move forward in this area, we will be able to solve this challenge of climate change.\u201d This directly acknowledges the issue and states that progress on tech and finance transfer is part of the solution going forward.\\n\\nTaken together, both leaders provide detailed, on-point descriptions of their strategies, commitments, and mechanisms for implementation, technology sharing, and financial support.
