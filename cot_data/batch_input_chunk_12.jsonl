So point blank, Democrats go after your tax returns, will you try to block that or will you allow them to have them?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, look, as I have told you, they're under audit. They have been for a long time. They're extremely complex. People wouldn't understand them. They're done by among the biggest and best law firms in the country. Same thing with the accounting firms. The accountants are\u2014a very, very large, powerful firm, from the standpoint of respect. They're highly respected, big firm. A great law firm. Or you know it very well. They do these things; they put them in. But people don't understand tax returns. Now, I did do a filing of over a hundred pages, I believe, which is in the offices. And when people went and saw that filing and they saw the magnitude of it, they were very disappointed. And they saw the\u2014you know, the detail. You'd get far more from that. And I guess we filed that now three times. But you get far more from that than you could ever get from a tax return.But when you're under audit\u2014and I'm on a very continuous audit, because there are so many companies, and it is a very big company\u2014far bigger than you would even understand. But it's a great company, but it's big, and it's complex. And it's probably feet high. It's a very complex instrument.And I think that people wouldn't understand it. But if I were finished with the audit, I would have an open mind to it. I would say that. But I don't want to do it during the audit. And really, no lawyer\u2014even from the other side, they say often\u2014not always\u2014but when you're under audit, you don't have\u2014you don't subject it to that. You get it done, and then you release it.So when that happens, if that happens, I would certainly have an open mind to it.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhether the President will try to block that or allow them to have his tax returns\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

One that you think is going to be tough turns out to be not much. And sometimes you think one\u2014and I've seen it. Because look I had 17\u2014we had actually a total of 18. A lot of people think 17. Governor of Virginia remember? Add the Governor of Virginia. Wasn't there long\u2014previous Governor.But of the 18 you know many were\u2014all their lives they wanted to be politicians. I never thought about being a politician until about 2 days before I decided to run. A little before that but not too much before.And they\u2014you know you looked at some of them they're very talented. You look at their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s it's like great. And sometimes the ones that I thought would be the toughest were not the toughest at all. I mean I could write a book. I should write a book.But some of the people that I did in the Republican\u2014because we had sort of a similar thing. We had 18 instead of\u2014I guess they have 24 or 25. But some of the ones that I thought would be absolutely\u2014absolutely without question the toughest turned out\u2014I didn't think they were tough at all. Others that a lot of people said weren't tough they were tougher.I think she was given far too much credit for what she did. That was so out of the can what she said. That thing was right out of a box. And I thought that he didn't respond great. I wouldn't say it was\u2014this was not Winston Churchill we're dealing with okay?

My second question is that, here at the G-20 summit, what can you tell us: Has the ball been moved in any particular direction towards easing the tensions with Iran in some of the meetings that you've had?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell I have had a lot of countries come up to me. France has come up. If you look at President Macron\u2014good guy\u2014he came up to me. He said You know I do a lot of business\u2014meaning France does a lot of business with .I would love to go see them. It's all right. Anybody can see them. I don't mind talking. I think talking is great. I'm not going to say: Oh don't talk to them. Don't talk to them.I do think John Kerry should not have been talking to them. I think that's delaying this process a lot. I think he violated the Logan Act actually. But I think John Kerry speaking to a lot maybe saying things like: Gee you know if you wait another 15 months maybe Trump will lose the election and then you can deal with a person that's a lot easier than Trump. You'll deal with a stiff that will give you everything you want. And that makes it a little tougher for me to make a deal but that's okay.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHas the ball been moved in any particular direction towards easing the tensions with Iran in some of the meetings that you've had?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

But in terms of criticism that you're, sort of, supporting a dictator instead of an American Vice President?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, when I look at what's been done by our Vice President and the President, when I look at the horrible Iran deal that they made, look what happened since I terminated the Iran deal. Look what has happened to Iran.Iran, when I first came into office, was a terror. They were fighting in many locations all over the Middle East. They were behind every single major attack, whether it was Syria, whether it was Yemen, whether it was individual, smaller areas, whether it was taking away oil from people. They were involved with everything.Now they're pulling back, because they're got serious economic problems. We have massive\u2014as you know, massive sanctions and other things. I mean, we just said the other day: steel, copper, different elements of what they used to sell. The oil is essentially dried up. And I'm not looking that\u2014to hurt Iran at all. I'm looking to have Iran say, No nuclear weapons. We have enough problems in this world right now with nuclear weapons. No nuclear weapons for Iran.And I think we'll make a deal. I think Iran\u2014again, I think Iran has tremendous economic potential. And I look forward to letting them get back to the stage where they can show that. I think Iran\u2014I know so many people from Iran. These are great people. It has a chance to be a great country, with the same leadership. We're not looking for regime change. I just want to make that clear. We're looking for no nuclear weapons.If you look at the deal that Biden and President Obama signed, they would have access\u2014free access\u2014to nuclear weapons, where they wouldn't even be in violation, in just a very short period of time. What kind of a deal is that?So we can't have that. Plus, there were many other things they did that were very bad. So I don't take sides as to who I'm in favor or who I'm not, but I can tell you that Joe Biden was a disaster. His administration, with President Obama, they were basically a disaster when it came to so many things, whether it was economy, whether it was military, defense. No matter what it was, they had a lot problems. So I'm not a fan.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nCriticism of supporting a dictator instead of an American Vice President\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}
