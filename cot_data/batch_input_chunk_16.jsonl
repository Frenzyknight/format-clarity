We get a kick every once and a while out of the fact that I'll be watching people that failed so badly over the last 25 years explaining to me how to make a deal with . I get a big, big kick out of that.But we are doing very well. I think that something very dramatic could happen. They're treating us with great respect. And you know, what's going on with South Korea\u2014and I think President Moon of South Korea was very generous in saying that we helped make the Olympics a great success, because of the fact that, as you know, there was a tremendous animosity, there was a tremendous problem going on. And all of a sudden, people started buying tickets because\u2014whole different feeling when North said, We'd love to go to the Olympics.So a lot of good things are happening with respect to . President Obama told me\u2014when I had the one meeting with him\u2014he said: That's your biggest problem. That's going to be the most difficult thing you have. And honestly, I wish it was handled earlier. I wish it were handled by another administration years ago. I'm not just talking about President Obama. I go back to any administration you want. But over the last 25 years, this should have been handled a long time ago, not now. This should not have been left for me to handle.But we will handle it. We're handling it well. And hopefully, there will peace for , South Korea, Germany\u2014I mean, everything is included\u2014Japan. The Chancellor has been very helpful in the maximum pressure campaign, as I said. Really, very helpful. So have many other nations. President Xi of China has been really good at the border. Everyone is surprised at how tight he clamped down. Everyone said that he'd just talk about it, he wouldn't do it. Well, he did it, and he did it out a relationship that we have and also out of the fact that we're negotiating trade deals, and I think that's also very important to him. Hopefully, we'll come up with something that's good for both countries.So I think some very good things can happen with respect to . We're setting up meetings now. We're down to two countries, as to a site, and we'll let you know what that site is.Do you have a question for the Chancellor?\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo you plan on speaking with him before?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, Mr. President. Hi there. After your discussions today with President Macron, what is your thinking about a timeline for bringing U.S. troops out of Syria?And on one other topic, you mentioned today that you thought the leader of North Korea has behaved openly and honorably. This is someone who many people have accused of starving his people, killing family members. What did you mean when you called him that?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, we will start with your second part of the question. And I hope that we will be able to deal in a very open and honorable fashion with . I started a process, and when I did, everybody thought I was doing it absolutely wrong. But in the meantime, for 25 years, people have been dealing, and nothing happened. And a lot is happening right now. I can tell you that, Jeff. A lot is happening. And I think it's going to be very positive. And I hope it's going to be very positive for and for South Korea and Japan and the rest of the world.But I am starting at a level that, frankly, I shouldn't have had to start. This should have been worked out a long time ago. This should have been worked out many years ago. We were discussing that. We shouldn't be having this situation happen to the United States and the world. This should have been resolved by other Presidents and by other leaders of other countries a long time ago.With that being said, I think we're doing very well. Meetings are being set up. And I want to see denuclearization of . A lot of concessions have already been made. We have made no concessions, despite some of the media saying that I've made concessions. I don't\u2014I haven't even discussed a concession other than the fact that meeting is a great thing. And I'm sure that a lot of other people would have liked to have had the position we're having.I will say this: We put the strongest sanctions on a country that we ever have put on any country, by far. China, President Xi, has been very strong in helping us to solve this problem, in his case, at the border. He's allowing very little to get through.I think he's doing that for a number of reasons. We have a very good relationship, and also, it's very important in terms of trade, because I do play the trade card. If you look at what's happening with trade in China, it hasn't been fair for many, many years to the United States, and we're going to solve that problem. In fact, we're having Secretary Mnuchin and a couple of other folks heading over to\u2014Bob Lighthizer\u2014heading over to China, at the request of China. They came here, as you know, last week. And we're having very substantive discussions on trade.But I think it all plays to the border and the fact that they have been extremely strong on the border and very little has gotten through, much to the surprise of a lot of people. And I believe the trade will work out, but I also think that China has never treated us with more respect than they have over the last short period of time that I'm President. I have a very excellent, as you know, relationship with President Xi. And I think that relationship is very important as to what's happening with .So the end result is, we'll see. Maybe good things will happen, and maybe we're all wasting a lot of time. But hopefully, it will be good for everybody concerned.As far as Syria is concerned, I would love to get out. I'd love to bring our incredible warriors back home. They've done a great job. We've essentially just absolutely obliterated ISIS in Iraq and in Syria. And we've done a big favor to neighboring countries, frankly, but we've also done a favor for our country.With that being said, Emmanuel and myself have discussed the fact that we don't want to give Iran open season to the Mediterranean, especially since we really control it. To a large extent, we really have controlled it, and we've set control on it. So we'll see what happens.But we're going to be coming home relatively soon. We finished, at least, almost our work with respect to ISIS in Syria, ISIS in Iraq, and we have done a job that nobody has been able to do.But with that being said, I do want to come home. But I want to come home also with having accomplished what we have to accomplish. So we are discussing Syria as part of an overall deal. When they made the Iran deal, what they should have done is included Syria. When I say should have\u2014before giving them, Iran, $150 billion and $1.8 billion in cash\u2014$1.8 million in cash. If you think about this, before giving this kind of tremendous money, okay\u2014$150 billion and $1.8 billion in cash\u2014in barrels, I hear, it was taken out, and in boxes it was taken out\u2014cash\u2014they should have made a deal that covered Yemen, that covered Syria, that covered other parts of the Middle East where Iraq is involved\u2014where Iran is involved.

Thank you, Mr. President. Hi there. After your discussions today with President Macron, what is your thinking about a timeline for bringing U.S. troops out of Syria?And on one other topic, you mentioned today that you thought the leader of North Korea has behaved openly and honorably. This is someone who many people have accused of starving his people, killing family members. What did you mean when you called him that?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, we will start with your second part of the question. And I hope that we will be able to deal in a very open and honorable fashion with . I started a process, and when I did, everybody thought I was doing it absolutely wrong. But in the meantime, for 25 years, people have been dealing, and nothing happened. And a lot is happening right now. I can tell you that, Jeff. A lot is happening. And I think it's going to be very positive. And I hope it's going to be very positive for and for South Korea and Japan and the rest of the world.But I am starting at a level that, frankly, I shouldn't have had to start. This should have been worked out a long time ago. This should have been worked out many years ago. We were discussing that. We shouldn't be having this situation happen to the United States and the world. This should have been resolved by other Presidents and by other leaders of other countries a long time ago.With that being said, I think we're doing very well. Meetings are being set up. And I want to see denuclearization of . A lot of concessions have already been made. We have made no concessions, despite some of the media saying that I've made concessions. I don't\u2014I haven't even discussed a concession other than the fact that meeting is a great thing. And I'm sure that a lot of other people would have liked to have had the position we're having.I will say this: We put the strongest sanctions on a country that we ever have put on any country, by far. China, President Xi, has been very strong in helping us to solve this problem, in his case, at the border. He's allowing very little to get through.I think he's doing that for a number of reasons. We have a very good relationship, and also, it's very important in terms of trade, because I do play the trade card. If you look at what's happening with trade in China, it hasn't been fair for many, many years to the United States, and we're going to solve that problem. In fact, we're having Secretary Mnuchin and a couple of other folks heading over to\u2014Bob Lighthizer\u2014heading over to China, at the request of China. They came here, as you know, last week. And we're having very substantive discussions on trade.But I think it all plays to the border and the fact that they have been extremely strong on the border and very little has gotten through, much to the surprise of a lot of people. And I believe the trade will work out, but I also think that China has never treated us with more respect than they have over the last short period of time that I'm President. I have a very excellent, as you know, relationship with President Xi. And I think that relationship is very important as to what's happening with .So the end result is, we'll see. Maybe good things will happen, and maybe we're all wasting a lot of time. But hopefully, it will be good for everybody concerned.As far as Syria is concerned, I would love to get out. I'd love to bring our incredible warriors back home. They've done a great job. We've essentially just absolutely obliterated ISIS in Iraq and in Syria. And we've done a big favor to neighboring countries, frankly, but we've also done a favor for our country.With that being said, Emmanuel and myself have discussed the fact that we don't want to give Iran open season to the Mediterranean, especially since we really control it. To a large extent, we really have controlled it, and we've set control on it. So we'll see what happens.But we're going to be coming home relatively soon. We finished, at least, almost our work with respect to ISIS in Syria, ISIS in Iraq, and we have done a job that nobody has been able to do.But with that being said, I do want to come home. But I want to come home also with having accomplished what we have to accomplish. So we are discussing Syria as part of an overall deal. When they made the Iran deal, what they should have done is included Syria. When I say should have\u2014before giving them, Iran, $150 billion and $1.8 billion in cash\u2014$1.8 million in cash. If you think about this, before giving this kind of tremendous money, okay\u2014$150 billion and $1.8 billion in cash\u2014in barrels, I hear, it was taken out, and in boxes it was taken out\u2014cash\u2014they should have made a deal that covered Yemen, that covered Syria, that covered other parts of the Middle East where Iraq is involved\u2014where Iran is involved. They didn't do that.So we want to come home. We'll be coming home. But we want to have a very, very strong\u2014we want to leave a strong and lasting footprint, and that was a very big part of our discussion. Okay?

A question from Agence France-Presse on behalf of the French press. As you arrived, Mr. President, you were saying that there was no plan B; that the Iran deal was to be preserved. Now you're talking about a new deal with Iran. Why do you change your mind? Did you join the strong approach suggested by President Trump? Is it because you could not convince him? And in addition, do you think the others who signed the agreement, the deal, will follow you?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWhen I said there was no plan B, I usually refer to the fact that there is no B planet. It was about climate rather than Iran. Rather\u2014now, regarding Iran, I've always been coherent, and you can go back to what I said at the U.N. General Assembly in September. I always said that there was the JCPOA, but we needed to add three pillars: post-2025, the ballistic issue, and the regional influence. I do not know what will decide regarding the JCPOA, and it is his responsibility.The JCPOA is the first pillar of this framework I just described. So I'm not saying that we're moving from one deal to another. I'm saying it is one aspect of the problem. I haven't\u2014have never been as critical of the JCPOA as has, because I believe that we can usefully add to it.But no matter the decision that will take, what I would like is to work, as from now, on a new deal with four pillars, including what is already covered by the JCPOA, that is ongoing nuclear\u2014I mean, the current nuclear activities, the longer nuclear activities, the ballistic activities, and the regional influenceSo this is constant. But over the past few weeks and over\u2014and in particular today, we've been able to go and to very much talk in details about this topic, including the situation in the region. And I believe that we've converged on a common reading of what is happening in Syria, in Yemen, in Iraq, in particular.And on the fact that the nuclear issue is not the only one, that indeed there is a problem with the ballistical activity of Iran and their presence in a number of countries in the region. And that our willingness was indeed to set the conditions for the stability of the region. Once we've built this convergence of view, the idea of moving on to a new deal that would include the solution for Syria, I believe, is a strong step forward thanks to the discussions we've had today.So I very much would like us to work together with all of our partners. And the Ministers of Foreign Affairs already gathered the small group, and they will be doing it again anytime soon. The purpose is to have some\u2014the allied powers\u2014and we amongst them\u2014and of course, also the regional powers, to work at the level of this small group. We also shall have some privileged discussions with Russia and Turkey on regional topics, including Syria. So as from now, we will work using that method in favor\u2014work towards a deal.I believe we can both combine our common views and our differences, because we are not in a vacuum. I always said we should not tear apart the JCPOA and have nothing else. I think this would be\u2014that would not be the good solution. But once we are placing ourselves in a momentum, the purpose of which is to put together a broad agreement covering the four topics I just mentioned, it's very different because, first of all, we can take on board the concerns and the criticism of regarding this deal, which, like I said, once again, this deal was supported by a former American administration and previous American administration.But we can work, and it is also about respecting the sovereignty of the states of the region. It's not about intervening no matter what. It is rather about building a stable framework that will contribute to stability and to peacebuilding. And I think this is what we've been agreeing upon today. It's not about tearing about an agreement and have nothing, but it's about building something new that will cover all of our concerns. And if I might add, they\u2014states and, as I alluded to\u2014that\u2014and countries that are in the area, some of which are immensely wealthy, would not be there except for the United States and, to a lesser extent, France. But they wouldn't be there except for the United States. They wouldn't last a week. We are protecting them. They have to now step up and pay for what's happening, because I don't think France or the United States should be liable for the tremendous cost.The United States is embarrassingly into the Middle East. As of a few months ago, as you've heard me say before\u2014and I don't take responsibility, but I would be very embarrassed if I had to\u2014$7 trillion. And when we want to build, Mr. President, our infrastructure, everybody says, Oh, we want to be careful with our money. When we want to fix a highway or we want to build schools and lots of other things\u2014tunnels, bridges\u2014they say, Oh, let's be careful with our money. And yet we have spent $7 trillion in the Middle East, and we've gotten nothing for it. Nothing. Less than nothing, as far as I'm concerned. That's over an 18-year period.The countries that are there, that you all know very well, are immensely wealthy; they're going to have to pay for this. And I think the President and I agree very much on that. And they will pay for it. They will pay for it. We've spoken to them. They will pay for it. The United States will not continue to pay. And they will also put soldiers on the ground, which they're not doing. And we will, in fact, bring lots of people home. We will have a strong blockage to the Mediterranean, which to me is very important\u2014because if we don't, you have Iran going right to the Mediterranean. Not going to have that.But there is a chance\u2014and nobody knows what I'm going to do on the 12th, although, Mr. President, you have a pretty good idea\u2014but we'll see. But we'll see also, if I do what some people expect, whether or not it will be possible to do a new deal with solid foundations. Because this a deal with decayed foundations. It's a bad deal. It's a bad structure. It's falling down. Should have never, ever been made. I blame Congress. I blame a lot of people for it. But it should have never been made, and we're going to see what happens on the 12th.But I will say, if Iran threatens us in any way, they will pay a price like few countries have ever paid.

And they will also put soldiers on the ground, which they're not doing. And we will, in fact, bring lots of people home. We will have a strong blockage to the Mediterranean, which to me is very important\u2014because if we don't, you have Iran going right to the Mediterranean. Not going to have that.But there is a chance\u2014and nobody knows what I'm going to do on the 12th, although, Mr. President, you have a pretty good idea\u2014but we'll see. But we'll see also, if I do what some people expect, whether or not it will be possible to do a new deal with solid foundations. Because this a deal with decayed foundations. It's a bad deal.

But it should have never been made, and we're going to see what happens on the 12th.But I will say, if Iran threatens us in any way, they will pay a price like few countries have ever paid.

A question from Agence France-Presse on behalf of the French press. As you arrived, Mr. President, you were saying that there was no plan B; that the Iran deal was to be preserved. Now you're talking about a new deal with Iran. Why do you change your mind? Did you join the strong approach suggested by President Trump? Is it because you could not convince him? And in addition, do you think the others who signed the agreement, the deal, will follow you?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWhen I said there was no plan B, I usually refer to the fact that there is no B planet. It was about climate rather than Iran. Rather\u2014now, regarding Iran, I've always been coherent, and you can go back to what I said at the U.N. General Assembly in September. I always said that there was the JCPOA, but we needed to add three pillars: post-2025, the ballistic issue, and the regional influence. I do not know what will decide regarding the JCPOA, and it is his responsibility.The JCPOA is the first pillar of this framework I just described. So I'm not saying that we're moving from one deal to another. I'm saying it is one aspect of the problem. I haven't\u2014have never been as critical of the JCPOA as has, because I believe that we can usefully add to it.But no matter the decision that will take, what I would like is to work, as from now, on a new deal with four pillars, including what is already covered by the JCPOA, that is ongoing nuclear\u2014I mean, the current nuclear activities, the longer nuclear activities, the ballistic activities, and the regional influenceSo this is constant. But over the past few weeks and over\u2014and in particular today, we've been able to go and to very much talk in details about this topic, including the situation in the region. And I believe that we've converged on a common reading of what is happening in Syria, in Yemen, in Iraq, in particular.And on the fact that the nuclear issue is not the only one, that indeed there is a problem with the ballistical activity of Iran and their presence in a number of countries in the region. And that our willingness was indeed to set the conditions for the stability of the region. Once we've built this convergence of view, the idea of moving on to a new deal that would include the solution for Syria, I believe, is a strong step forward thanks to the discussions we've had today.So I very much would like us to work together with all of our partners. And the Ministers of Foreign Affairs already gathered the small group, and they will be doing it again anytime soon. The purpose is to have some\u2014the allied powers\u2014and we amongst them\u2014and of course, also the regional powers, to work at the level of this small group. We also shall have some privileged discussions with Russia and Turkey on regional topics, including Syria. So as from now, we will work using that method in favor\u2014work towards a deal.I believe we can both combine our common views and our differences, because we are not in a vacuum. I always said we should not tear apart the JCPOA and have nothing else. I think this would be\u2014that would not be the good solution. But once we are placing ourselves in a momentum, the purpose of which is to put together a broad agreement covering the four topics I just mentioned, it's very different because, first of all, we can take on board the concerns and the criticism of regarding this deal, which, like I said, once again, this deal was supported by a former American administration and previous American administration.But we can work, and it is also about respecting the sovereignty of the states of the region. It's not about intervening no matter what. It is rather about building a stable framework that will contribute to stability and to peacebuilding. And I think this is what we've been agreeing upon today. It's not about tearing about an agreement and have nothing, but it's about building something new that will cover all of our concerns. And if I might add, they\u2014states and, as I alluded to\u2014that\u2014and countries that are in the area, some of which are immensely wealthy, would not be there except for the United States and, to a lesser extent, France. But they wouldn't be there except for the United States. They wouldn't last a week. We are protecting them. They have to now step up and pay for what's happening, because I don't think France or the United States should be liable for the tremendous cost.The United States is embarrassingly into the Middle East. As of a few months ago, as you've heard me say before\u2014and I don't take responsibility, but I would be very embarrassed if I had to\u2014$7 trillion. And when we want to build, Mr. President, our infrastructure, everybody says, Oh, we want to be careful with our money. When we want to fix a highway or we want to build schools and lots of other things\u2014tunnels, bridges\u2014they say, Oh, let's be careful with our money. And yet we have spent $7 trillion in the Middle East, and we've gotten nothing for it. Nothing. Less than nothing, as far as I'm concerned. That's over an 18-year period.The countries that are there, that you all know very well, are immensely wealthy; they're going to have to pay for this. And I think the President and I agree very much on that. And they will pay for it. They will pay for it. We've spoken to them. They will pay for it. The United States will not continue to pay. And they will also put soldiers on the ground, which they're not doing. And we will, in fact, bring lots of people home.

Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for President Macron as well. But if I could to you, sir, first: Your nominee to run the Veterans Affairs Administration, Dr. Ronny Jackson, has run into some serious political headwinds on Capitol Hill with some serious allegations being leveled at him. I'm wondering what you know of those allegations. And do you intend to stand behind him?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I haven't heard of the particular allegations, but I will tell you he's one of the finest people that I have met, and I think speaking for Melania, also. He's been the doctor for President Obama, I believe for President Bush, for me. I've gotten to know him pretty well. He's a great doctor.And it was a suggestion. Now, I know there's an experience problem, because lack of experience. But there's an experience problem\u2014the Veterans Administration is very important to me. We've done a great job with it, as you know, with the Accountability Act and many other things. Now we're working on choice. It's going to happen. We're going to take great care of our veterans. That's a very, very important thing, and we've done a great job.But I told Admiral Jackson just a little while ago, I said, What do you need this for? This is a vicious group of people that malign\u2014and they do. And I've lived through it; we all lived through it. You people are getting record ratings because of it, so congratulations. But I said, What do you need it for? He's an admiral. He's a great leader. And they questioned him about every little thing. As you know, with the success of what will, hopefully, soon be Secretary of State Pompeo, everybody was very surprised. I heard 10 minutes before the vote yesterday on committee that, He will not be approved at committee\u2014which would be the first time in many, many decades that something like that would have happened with regard to a Secretary of State\u2014except I spoke to Rand Paul, and Rand Paul has really never let me down. He\u2014Rand Paul is a good man. And I knew things that nobody else knew. And Rand Paul said, I'm going to change my vote, and he voted, and everybody was surprised. And he actually got an 11-to-9 vote, because as you know, Johnny Isakson's vote counts if it isn't the deciding vote. So it was actually a 11-to-9 with, I believe, an\u2014there was one vote\u2014what would you call that, John?\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDoes the Mr. President intend to stand behind Dr. Ronny Jackson?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Mr. President, BFM Television. President Macron, for a year now, you've enjoyed a very friendly relationship with President Trump. Quite unusual, compared to the previous Presidents. At the same time, we can see that you do not agree on a number of topics. There are more and more of them. We've seen that openly in the Oval Office earlier on Iran. It seems like the initial deal with Iran will not be able to be saved. So what about this relationship? Can it have some concrete impact on France? Can it be beneficial to France and to Europe? You talked about reciprocal interests. Is that really the case today?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes, definitely. I believe the reason why we enjoy this relationship is because of the relationship between our two countries. Indeed, we have a different background, but it is maybe because we both are not politicians\u2014or typical politicians. And none of us easily change one's mind. And I think that if you listen to this press conference, you\u2014and watched us, you have the answer to your question.Regarding Iran, we have a disagreement regarding the JCPOA, but I think we are overcoming it by deciding to work towards a deal\u2014an overall deal\u2014that will enable us to deal with the issue of\u2014nuclear issue, but also treat it together with another three issues, which were not being dealt with so far.So should the decision\u2014I mean, we've spent more than an hour, just the two of us\u2014and had the conclusions been that the U.S.\u2014the United States of America would walk away from the JCPOA and France would not move, then our friendship would be wasted. But it is about making sure that we're each taking into account the position and the interests of our reciprocal countries.It is unprecedented. We've never before taken a joint position, a joint stance on Syria the way we did, and on Iran, in favor of a deal that will enable us to cover the four pillars. There is intense work between ourselves and our teams; otherwise, we would not have\u2014we would not be in a position to do as much.In the past, sometimes, France argued that it was time to take action against chemical weapons, and it was\u2014France was not followed by its allies, including the United States at the time. It is not what happened this time. We decided together what was possible and what was not. What was legitimate within an international framework, as two members of the Security Council, and we conducted an unprecedented military intervention at an unprecedented\u2014unprecedented\u2014level of cooperation.And please allow me to pay tribute to our troops, to our armies, and to that of the United Kingdom because we've led a unique operation, a proportionate one, and we were able to do so thanks to this relation that we enjoy.So on Syria, Iran, the credibility of the international community against the use of chemical weapons, you've seen it. You have the evidence that showed that the relationship between our two countries and our friendship enable us to achieve some concrete results. And this is an improvement compared where we stood a couple of weeks ago. Well, I think that we have very much in common, I must say. I think many things that we\u2014certainly, most things we agreed with, we can change, and we can be flexible. You know, in life you have to be flexible. And as leaders of countries, you have to show flexibility. And I think we actually get along on many of the subjects we discussed today. And I will say, France is a great country. And I believe France will be taken to new heights under this President. He's going to be an outstanding President, one of your great Presidents. And it's an honor to call you my friend. Thank you.

Mr. President, BFM Television. President Macron, for a year now, you've enjoyed a very friendly relationship with President Trump. Quite unusual, compared to the previous Presidents. At the same time, we can see that you do not agree on a number of topics. There are more and more of them. We've seen that openly in the Oval Office earlier on Iran. It seems like the initial deal with Iran will not be able to be saved. So what about this relationship? Can it have some concrete impact on France? Can it be beneficial to France and to Europe? You talked about reciprocal interests. Is that really the case today?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes, definitely. I believe the reason why we enjoy this relationship is because of the relationship between our two countries. Indeed, we have a different background, but it is maybe because we both are not politicians\u2014or typical politicians. And none of us easily change one's mind. And I think that if you listen to this press conference, you\u2014and watched us, you have the answer to your question.Regarding Iran, we have a disagreement regarding the JCPOA, but I think we are overcoming it by deciding to work towards a deal\u2014an overall deal\u2014that will enable us to deal with the issue of\u2014nuclear issue, but also treat it together with another three issues, which were not being dealt with so far.So should the decision\u2014I mean, we've spent more than an hour, just the two of us\u2014and had the conclusions been that the U.S.\u2014the United States of America would walk away from the JCPOA and France would not move, then our friendship would be wasted. But it is about making sure that we're each taking into account the position and the interests of our reciprocal countries.It is unprecedented. We've never before taken a joint position, a joint stance on Syria the way we did, and on Iran, in favor of a deal that will enable us to cover the four pillars. There is intense work between ourselves and our teams; otherwise, we would not have\u2014we would not be in a position to do as much.In the past, sometimes, France argued that it was time to take action against chemical weapons, and it was\u2014France was not followed by its allies, including the United States at the time. It is not what happened this time. We decided together what was possible and what was not. What was legitimate within an international framework, as two members of the Security Council, and we conducted an unprecedented military intervention at an unprecedented\u2014unprecedented\u2014level of cooperation.And please allow me to pay tribute to our troops, to our armies, and to that of the United Kingdom because we've led a unique operation, a proportionate one, and we were able to do so thanks to this relation that we enjoy.So on Syria, Iran, the credibility of the international community against the use of chemical weapons, you've seen it. You have the evidence that showed that the relationship between our two countries and our friendship enable us to achieve some concrete results. And this is an improvement compared where we stood a couple of weeks ago. Well, I think that we have very much in common, I must say. I think many things that we\u2014certainly, most things we agreed with, we can change, and we can be flexible. You know, in life you have to be flexible. And as leaders of countries, you have to show flexibility. And I think we actually get along on many of the subjects we discussed today. And I will say, France is a great country. And I believe France will be taken to new heights under this President. He's going to be an outstanding President, one of your great Presidents. And it's an honor to call you my friend. Thank you.

Thank you very much, Mr. President. Mr. Prime Minister, nice to see you again. Mr. President, you sent your CIA Director to Pyongyang a couple of weeks ago, and he returned without three Americans who are being detained there and also without any other visible signs of concessions the North Koreans had made to the United States in advance of your meeting with Mr. Kim.My question is: Do you intend or are you willing to sit down with Kim Jong Un if Americans are still being held in North Korea? And will you insist on other tangible concessions from the North Koreans in return for gestures like sending a potential future Secretary of State to North Korea?And for the Prime Minister, if I may, you, a moment ago, alluded to new trade talks between your minister and Mr. Lighthizer. Should we interpret that to mean that you are now open to negotiating a bilateral trade deal between the United States and Japan?And then, a second question: Japan is the only major American ally that was not exempted from the steel tariffs. Did you ask the President to exempt Japan? And if so, how did he reply?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThank you, Mark, very much. The fact is that they do have three prisoners. We have been talking about them. We are negotiating now. We are doing our very best. As you know, they've been there a long time, and it's harsh treatment. We fought very hard to get Otto Warmbier back. And when we came back, he was in very, very bad condition. It was a very sad event.We are likewise fighting very diligently to get the three American citizens back. I think there's a good chance of doing it. We're having very good dialogue. We will keep you informed. But we are in there, and we are working very hard on that.We have come a long way with North Korea. We were, as you know\u2014and when I say we, for many years, they've been talking to North Korea and nothing has happened. This should have been taken care of by past administrations when they were not nearly so far along. But we put unbelievably powerful sanctions on and many other things.I want to thank publicly President Xi of China, who has done more for us than he's done for any other administration or than any leader of China has done for any President or administration. He has clogged up the border, as you know, and he's done it very, very powerfully. He would tell you himself that he never thought he would go to this extent, and I appreciate that very much. But it's put a lot of pressure on.And, as you know, 93 percent of the goods coming into North Korea come in from China. And President Xi understands that this is a very important set of months that are lying ahead. He doesn't want to see a Korea\u2014North Korea or any Korea\u2014that has nuclear weapons either. So he's also fighting for China when it comes to this. But he has been terrific. Can he be better? I always say yes, he can be better. I said: President, you've been great. Can you be better? Yes. But he's been very good, and it's had a big impact. And what we've done has had a big impact.So we've never been in a position like this with that regime, whether it's father, grandfather, or son. And I hope to have a very successful meeting. If we don't think it's going to be successful, Mark, we won't have it. We won't have it. If I think that it's a meeting that is not going to be fruitful, we're not going to go. If the meeting, when I'm there, is not fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting, and we'll continue what we're doing or whatever it is that we'll continue. But something will happen. So I like always remaining flexible, and we'll remain flexible here. I've gotten it to this point. President Moon of South Korea was very generous when he said, if it weren't for Donald Trump, the Olympics would have been a total failure. It was my involvement and the involvement of our great country that made the Olympics a very successful Olympics. If you look at ticket sales prior to what took place with respect to North Korea, it was going to be a big problem, and it turned out to be a very successful Olympics.So we've gotten us here, and I think we're going to be successful. But if for any reason I feel we're not, we end. Okay? Thank you, Mark.. Between President Trump and myself, for benefiting both Japan and the U.S., we are\u2014have expanded the investment and trade based on the foundation\u2014open and fair economic development in the Indo-Pacific region. We are\u2014have agreed to start talks for free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals at this time.As for section 232, Japanese steel and aluminum would not exert any negative influence on the U.S. security. Rather, it's our position that the quality of Japanese product is high. Many of those products are difficult to be replaced with, and they are greatly contributing to the U.S. industries and employment. So recognizing that, we'd like to continue to respond to this matter going forward. I will add that the 232, having to do with aluminum and steel tariffs\u201430 percent, in one case; 25 percent and 10 percent\u2014that it's got us to the bargaining table with many nations, and, in other cases, they're paying. And it's billions of dollars coming into the coffers of the United States. So they've been, actually, very important.If you look at what we did with solar panels, where we put 30 percent tariffs on, we had 32 companies opened with pretty new plants, because it's a relatively new industry. Of the 32 plants, 30 were closed, and 2 were not doing well. Since putting the tariffs on, the two are doing very well, seven or eight are going to be opening, and a lot more will open.Same thing with washing machines. We were, believe it not, having washing machines dumped all over the country. We put tariffs on, and we're now opening up and expanding companies that create and make\u2014which is actually a very big business\u2014washing machines and dryers.So the workers of our country know what's happening. We have companies moving up from Mexico, automobile companies, and they're building new plants in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Kentucky and expanding their plants. A lot of things are happening. Our country is doing very, very well. And it's going to continue. It's going to continue. A lot of great momentum.If you look at any chart, the enthusiasm for business in our country is at an alltime high. And unemployment, for African American workers, for Hispanic workers, unemployment is at an alltime low. In history, in the history of our country, it's at the lowest point.

Thank you very much, Mr. President. Mr. Prime Minister, nice to see you again. Mr. President, you sent your CIA Director to Pyongyang a couple of weeks ago, and he returned without three Americans who are being detained there and also without any other visible signs of concessions the North Koreans had made to the United States in advance of your meeting with Mr. Kim.My question is: Do you intend or are you willing to sit down with Kim Jong Un if Americans are still being held in North Korea? And will you insist on other tangible concessions from the North Koreans in return for gestures like sending a potential future Secretary of State to North Korea?And for the Prime Minister, if I may, you, a moment ago, alluded to new trade talks between your minister and Mr. Lighthizer. Should we interpret that to mean that you are now open to negotiating a bilateral trade deal between the United States and Japan?And then, a second question: Japan is the only major American ally that was not exempted from the steel tariffs. Did you ask the President to exempt Japan? And if so, how did he reply?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThank you, Mark, very much. The fact is that they do have three prisoners. We have been talking about them. We are negotiating now. We are doing our very best. As you know, they've been there a long time, and it's harsh treatment. We fought very hard to get Otto Warmbier back. And when we came back, he was in very, very bad condition. It was a very sad event.We are likewise fighting very diligently to get the three American citizens back. I think there's a good chance of doing it. We're having very good dialogue. We will keep you informed. But we are in there, and we are working very hard on that.We have come a long way with North Korea. We were, as you know\u2014and when I say we, for many years, they've been talking to North Korea and nothing has happened. This should have been taken care of by past administrations when they were not nearly so far along. But we put unbelievably powerful sanctions on and many other things.I want to thank publicly President Xi of China, who has done more for us than he's done for any other administration or than any leader of China has done for any President or administration. He has clogged up the border, as you know, and he's done it very, very powerfully. He would tell you himself that he never thought he would go to this extent, and I appreciate that very much. But it's put a lot of pressure on.And, as you know, 93 percent of the goods coming into North Korea come in from China. And President Xi understands that this is a very important set of months that are lying ahead. He doesn't want to see a Korea\u2014North Korea or any Korea\u2014that has nuclear weapons either. So he's also fighting for China when it comes to this. But he has been terrific. Can he be better? I always say yes, he can be better. I said: President, you've been great. Can you be better? Yes. But he's been very good, and it's had a big impact. And what we've done has had a big impact.So we've never been in a position like this with that regime, whether it's father, grandfather, or son. And I hope to have a very successful meeting. If we don't think it's going to be successful, Mark, we won't have it. We won't have it. If I think that it's a meeting that is not going to be fruitful, we're not going to go. If the meeting, when I'm there, is not fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting, and we'll continue what we're doing or whatever it is that we'll continue. But something will happen. So I like always remaining flexible, and we'll remain flexible here. I've gotten it to this point. President Moon of South Korea was very generous when he said, if it weren't for Donald Trump, the Olympics would have been a total failure. It was my involvement and the involvement of our great country that made the Olympics a very successful Olympics. If you look at ticket sales prior to what took place with respect to North Korea, it was going to be a big problem, and it turned out to be a very successful Olympics.So we've gotten us here, and I think we're going to be successful. But if for any reason I feel we're not, we end. Okay? Thank you, Mark.. Between President Trump and myself, for benefiting both Japan and the U.S., we are\u2014have expanded the investment and trade based on the foundation\u2014open and fair economic development in the Indo-Pacific region. We are\u2014have agreed to start talks for free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals at this time.As for section 232, Japanese steel and aluminum would not exert any negative influence on the U.S. security. Rather, it's our position that the quality of Japanese product is high. Many of those products are difficult to be replaced with, and they are greatly contributing to the U.S. industries and employment. So recognizing that, we'd like to continue to respond to this matter going forward. I will add that the 232, having to do with aluminum and steel tariffs\u201430 percent, in one case; 25 percent and 10 percent\u2014that it's got us to the bargaining table with many nations, and, in other cases, they're paying. And it's billions of dollars coming into the coffers of the United States. So they've been, actually, very important.If you look at what we did with solar panels, where we put 30 percent tariffs on, we had 32 companies opened with pretty new plants, because it's a relatively new industry. Of the 32 plants, 30 were closed, and 2 were not doing well. Since putting the tariffs on, the two are doing very well, seven or eight are going to be opening, and a lot more will open.Same thing with washing machines. We were, believe it not, having washing machines dumped all over the country. We put tariffs on, and we're now opening up and expanding companies that create and make\u2014which is actually a very big business\u2014washing machines and dryers.So the workers of our country know what's happening. We have companies moving up from Mexico, automobile companies, and they're building new plants in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Kentucky and expanding their plants. A lot of things are happening. Our country is doing very, very well. And it's going to continue. It's going to continue. A lot of great momentum.If you look at any chart, the enthusiasm for business in our country is at an alltime high. And unemployment, for African American workers, for Hispanic workers, unemployment is at an alltime low. In history, in the history of our country, it's at the lowest point. If you look at unemployment for women, it's at an 18-year low. So we're very proud of our achievements.And starting know, as you see, over the last few weeks, the tax cuts are kicking in. And it's a beautiful thing to see. And people are spending money where they didn't have the money to spend previously. So we're very happy with that.Shinzo, please.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nMr. President, do you intend or are you willing to sit down with Kim Jong Un if Americans are still being held in North Korea?

And I said to him right then and there last night at the table, I said we will work very hard on that issue, and we will try and bring those folks back home. Very, very hard.. Whether Japan will be left behind, that is not at all the case. In the last 2 days, together with President Trump, we have spoken about North Korea. There will be the inter-Korean talks, and a U.S.-North Korea summit is planned. We have gone into really in-depth discussion. About our policy and direction, we have reached agreement.Regarding the upcoming U.S.-North Korea summit, we hope that it will lead to the resolution of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear missile, and of course, more than anything else, we hope it will be a historic summit that will lead to the resolution of abduction. And for that purpose, I have seriously and thoroughly discussed it with President Trump, and we have fully agreed about our direction going forward, in particular regarding abduction. As Donald has explained in our t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate, we have thoroughly discussed about this matter.Last year, the President met with the victims of the abduction, as well as the family members. And their families' feelings have been strongly felt and understood by the President, and he has given a very encouraging comment that he would appeal towards early resolution. I highly appreciate this encouraging comment. This gives us huge courage, a very encouraging comment. And for the families of the abductees, again, this is a massively, powerfully encouraging comment.And therefore, going forward between Japan and the U.S., or between the trilateral of Japan, U.S., and South Korea, we will cooperate closely and do our utmost to resolve the issues of North Korea, including abduction, nuclear, and missiles. And we will be very loyal to Japan.

As soon as they very much deserve it, we will have\u2014that is a question. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than President Donald Trump. Between building up the military, between creating tremendous vast amounts of oil. We raised billions and billions of dollars extra in NATO. We had a very, very severe\u2014we were talking about it a little while\u2014fight in Syria recently, a month ago, between our troops and Russian troops, and that's very sad. But many people died in that fight. There has been nobody tougher than me. With the media, no matter what I did, it's never tough enough, because that's their narrative. But Russia will tell you, there has been nobody tougher than Donald Trump.

And as you remember in civilian life, for years I said, Keep the oil. I was always saying, Keep the oil. We didn't keep the oil. Who got the oil? It was ISIS got the oil, a lot of it. That's what funded their campaigns. They took a lot of the oil, and it was largely responsible for funding. We should have kept the oil then. We didn't keep the oil.So I want to get back. I want to rebuild our Nation. Think of it: $7 trillion over a 17-year period; we have nothing\u2014nothing\u2014except death and destruction. It's a horrible thing. So it's time. It's time. We were very successful against ISIS. We'll be successful against anybody militarily. But sometimes, it's time to come back home, and we're thinking about that very seriously. Okay?

Compromise with two. Following mass shootings, there's often a lot of talk and little action. So I ask you today: What specific pieces of legislation or legislative framework will you propose to lawmakers following the Parkland shooting?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, we're going to do a lot, but we are going to be very strong on background checks. I've spoken with many of our people in Congress\u2014our Senators, our Congressmen and women\u2014and there's a movement on to get something done. We want to be very powerful on background checks.When we're dealing with the mentally ill, as we were in this last case\u2014he was a very sick person and somebody that should have been nabbed. I guess they had 39 different occasions where they were able to see him or potentially see him. We want to be very powerful, very strong on background checks and especially as it pertains to the mentally ill. We're going to get rid of the bump stocks, and we're going to do certain other things.But one of the feelings that I have, and you probably heard me in a speech this morning\u2014very, very important that we have offensive capability as well as defensive capability that's within the schools. Because when you have a gun-free zone, you're really inviting people to come in and do whatever you have to do and, oftentimes, get out.Now, I was the one that brought up the fact that these shootings, on average, last 3 minutes, and it takes anywhere from 6 to 10 minutes for the police to get to the site. And I want to have people in the building. And, in many cases, you have ex-marines and ex-Army and Navy and Air Force and Coast Guard\u2014you have them in the building, and they can have concealed weapons and still be teachers, or they could be in the building in a different capacity.But we have to have offensive capability to take these people out rapidly before they can do this kind of damage. But we'll be putting in strong language having to do with the background checks, and that will take place very quickly.I spoke with Paul Ryan this morning, with Mitch McConnell, and people are looking to really energize. I know that you've had\u2014this has been going on for a long time. Many, many years. And you've had people in my position, and they would mention things, but not a lot of things got done, obviously. We take it very seriously. We want to put an end to it.And if, by the way, the bad guy thinks that somebody is in this room with a weapon that's going to be pointed at him with live bullets, he's not even going into the school. It's the one way you're going to solve it. You're not going to solve it with gun-free spaces, because they'll get in there, and they're going to be the only one with a gun. So we need offensive capability, and we're going to be doing something about it. We're dealing with Congress right now.Thank you.

If I could follow up, Mr. President. Amid talks of arming teachers and mental health, what specific commitments to American students can you make that these policies will make them safer?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I think it's going to make it safer, and, you know, the problem that's been happening over the last 20 years is people have talked\u2014you said it\u2014it's all talk, it's no action. And we're going to take action. I think it's going to make it safer. I think the fact that you have some capability within a school, they're not going to go into that school. They're not going to do it.You can look at what's happened with airplanes where we put marshals on planes with guns; where pilots, in many cases, have guns. Nothing has happened for a long period of time, when it used to almost\u2014it was getting to a point of being routine. When you have somebody with a gun staring you down, it's going to be a lot different for them to walk into those schools.Right now they look at the sign outside, This is a gun-free environment. That means they're the only one with a gun. And the damage this lunatic did in that school for such a long period of time.And, frankly, you had a gun, and he was outside as a guard, and he decided not to go in. That was not his finest moment, that I can tell you. He waited, and he didn't want to go into the school. I just heard this, and it's a terrible situation.But we need people that can take care of our children. We're not going to let this happen again. And the way it's not going to happen again\u2014because they're basically cowards. Innately, they're cowards. And if they know bad things happen to them, once they get into that school, by people that love the children\u2014see, a security guard doesn't know the children, doesn't love the children. This man standing outside of the school the other day doesn't love the children, probably doesn't know the children. The teachers love their children; they love their pupils; they love their students. They're doing it also from love. Now, they have to be very adept. I'm not talking about every teacher; I'm talking about a small percentage. But people that have great ability with weaponry, with guns, those are the only people I'm talking about it. But they'll protect the student.For the Prime Minister?\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nSpecific commitments to American students regarding the policies of arming teachers and mental health.\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thanks, gentlemen. Mr. Trump, Mr. Turnbull, Phil Coorey from the Financial Review. To you, Mr. Trump, just on the region and China and associated issues, the United States Navy has conducted, frequently, freedom-of-navigation sail-throughs through the disputed areas. Would you like to see the Australian Navy participate directly in those operations alongside their U.S. allies?And whilst on the region, could I ask you what your latest thinking is on the Trans-Pacific Partnership? Are you softening your opposition to that, or do you remain as opposed as ever?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I think the Trans-Pacific Partnership was not a good deal for us. And if they made it a good deal for us, I'd go in. But honestly, it wasn't. I like bilateral deals much more than multilateral. I like to be able to negotiate with one country. And if it doesn't work out, you terminate. And during the termination notice, right after you consent, they call you and they say, Please, let's make a deal, and you fix the deal. When you get into multi, you can't do that.But Trans-Pacific Partnership\u2014TPP\u2014was a very bad deal for the United States. It would have cost us tremendous amounts of jobs. It would have been bad. But there's a possibility we would go in, but they will be offering us a much better deal. I would certainly do that.As far as your lanes are concerned, we'd love to have Australia involved, and I think Australia wants us to stay involved. I have to say, we've developed a great relationship with China, other than the fact that they've been killing us on trade for the last long period of time\u2014killing us, absolutely killing the United States on trade.But we have developed a great relationship with China\u2014probably closer than we've ever had.

Thanks, gentlemen. Mr. Trump, Mr. Turnbull, Phil Coorey from the Financial Review. To you, Mr. Trump, just on the region and China and associated issues, the United States Navy has conducted, frequently, freedom-of-navigation sail-throughs through the disputed areas. Would you like to see the Australian Navy participate directly in those operations alongside their U.S. allies?And whilst on the region, could I ask you what your latest thinking is on the Trans-Pacific Partnership? Are you softening your opposition to that, or do you remain as opposed as ever?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I think the Trans-Pacific Partnership was not a good deal for us. And if they made it a good deal for us, I'd go in. But honestly, it wasn't. I like bilateral deals much more than multilateral. I like to be able to negotiate with one country. And if it doesn't work out, you terminate. And during the termination notice, right after you consent, they call you and they say, Please, let's make a deal, and you fix the deal. When you get into multi, you can't do that.But Trans-Pacific Partnership\u2014TPP\u2014was a very bad deal for the United States. It would have cost us tremendous amounts of jobs. It would have been bad. But there's a possibility we would go in, but they will be offering us a much better deal. I would certainly do that.As far as your lanes are concerned, we'd love to have Australia involved, and I think Australia wants us to stay involved. I have to say, we've developed a great relationship with China, other than the fact that they've been killing us on trade for the last long period of time\u2014killing us, absolutely killing the United States on trade.But we have developed a great relationship with China\u2014probably closer than we've ever had.

If that proceeds, would you be willing to grant a waiver to Jared Kushner, one of your senior advisors?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, Jared has done an outstanding job. I think he's been treated very unfairly. He's a high-quality person. He works for nothing, just so\u2014nobody ever reports that. But he gets zero. He doesn't get a salary, nor does Ivanka, who's now in South Korea\u2014long trip\u2014representing her country. And we cannot get a better representative. In fact, the First Lady, Melania, was telling me what a great impression she made this morning when she landed in South Korea.Jared is truly outstanding. He was very successful when he was in the private sector. He's working on peace in the Middle East and some other small and very easy deals. They've always said peace in the Middle East, peace between the Palestinians and Israel, is the toughest deal of any deal there is.Malcolm, I've heard this all my life, that as a former dealmaker\u2014although now you could say maybe I'm more of a dealmaker than ever before; you have no choice as President to do it right\u2014but the hardest deal to make of any kind is between the Israelis and the Palestinians. We're actually making great headway. Jerusalem was the right thing to do. We took that off the table.But Jared Kushner is right in the middle of that, and he's an extraordinary dealmaker. And if he does that, that will be an incredible accomplishment and a very important thing for our country.So General Kelly\u2014who's doing a terrific job, by the way\u2014is right in the middle of that. We inherited a system that's broken. It's a system where many people have just\u2014it's taken months and months and months to get many people that do not have a complex financial\u2014you know, complicated financials. They don't have that, and it's still taken months. It's a broken system, and it shouldn't take this long. You know how many people are on that list, people with not a problem in the world.So that will be up to General Kelly. General Kelly respects Jared a lot, and General Kelly will make that call. I won't make that call. I will let the General, who's right here, make that call.But Jared is doing some very important things for our country. He gets paid zero. Ivanka, by the way, gets paid zero. She gave up a very good and very strong, solid big business in order to come to Washington, because she wanted to help families and she wanted to help women. She said, Dad, I want to go to Washington, I want to help women. And I said, You know, Washington is a mean place. She said: I don't care. I want to help women. I want to help families. And she was very much involved, as you know, in the child tax credit. And now she's working very much on family leave\u2014things that I don't think would have been in the agreement if it weren't for Ivanka and some of our great Senators, et cetera. But she was very much in the forefront of that.So I will let General Kelly make that decision. And he's going to do what's right for the country. And I have no doubt he'll make the right decision. Okay?

We're also\u2014we were very much weakened over the last long period of time, but not with me.No, I don't expect that. I think we're going to have\u2014because of strength\u2014peace through strength. I think we're going to have a long period of peace. I hope we do. We have certainly problems with North Korea, but a lot of good talks are going on right now, a lot of good energy. I see a lot of good energy. I like it very much, what I'm seeing.I just spoke this morning with the\u2014as you know, with the President\u2014President Moon of South Korea. He had some really great meetings. His representatives had a great, great meeting. And I had some very good feedback from that. So hopefully, a lot of good things are going to work out. No, I think that we will have peace through strength. Our military will be stronger than it ever was in a very short period of time. And that's my opinion. That's not the general's opinion, but I think my opinion counts more right now. [] Thank you.. Maybe I can just add that the reason why we are so happy that we have U.S. marines training in Norway is that that's part of the deterrence strategy that makes sure that we don't have a war in the future. . Yes. And, Sarah [Sarah Westwood, Washington Examiner], did you have a question? You were about to ask a question?

No collusion. When I watch you interviewing all the people leaving their committees\u2014I mean, the Democrats are all running for office, and they're trying to say this, that. But bottom line, they all say there's no collusion. And there is no collusion.And when you talk about interviews, Hillary Clinton had an interview where she wasn't sworn in, she wasn't given the oath, they didn't take notes, they didn't record, and it was done on the Fourth of July weekend. That's perhaps ridiculous, and a lot of people looked upon that as being a very serious breach. And it really was.But again, I'll speak to attorneys.

Mr. President, Prime Minister, Norway strongly supports the Paris Agreement and have expressed regret that you have decided to leave it. What could persuade you to remain? And what kind of common ground did you find in your talks today on this topic?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, it wasn't a major topic, I must tell you. We talked about other things, including mostly trade. But I will say that the Paris Agreement, as drawn and as we signed, was very unfair to the United States. It put great penalties on us. It made it very difficult for us to deal, in terms of business. It took away a lot of our asset values.We are a country rich in gas and coal and oil and lots of other things, and there was a tremendous penalty for using it. It hurt our businesses. According to some estimates, we would have had to close businesses in order to qualify by 2025. Whereas, as an example, China, by 2030\u2014they don't kick in until 2030. Russia, someplace in the mid-1990s\u2014that was their standard, and that was never a good standard, because that was a dirty standard for the environment.It treated the United States very unfairly, and frankly, it's an agreement that I have no problem with, but I had a problem with the agreement that they signed, because as usual, they made a bad deal.So we could conceivably go back in, but I say this: We are very strong on the environment. I feel very strongly about the environment. Our EPA and our EPA commissioners are very, very powerful in the sense that they want to have clean water, clean air, but we also want businesses that can compete. And the Paris accord really would have taken away our competitive edge. And we're not going to let that happen. I'm not going to let it happen.. And if I just might add that there are business opportunities in this\u2014\u2014 . It's true.. \u2014\u2014as we talked about during this\u2014because we have strict regulations on\u2014to reach our Paris targets. That means that we have very strong policies for environmental-friendly and climate-friendly technologies, and which is a small part of why the United States now have a surplus in the economy towards Norway. So you never miss up on a good opportunity with good environmental standards. Okay. . One of the great assets of Norway is a thing called water. And they have tremendous hydropower\u2014tremendous. In fact, most of your energy or your electricity is produced by hydro. I wish we'd do some of that. [] But hydropower is fantastic, and it's a great asset that you have.Thank you very much.

And among them, the visit to the United States by Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc in May this year and the state visit to Vietnam of Honorable President Donald Trump in the very first year of his term of office are the highlights.Meetings between leaders of Vietnam and the President during his visit are very useful, and the meetings give us the opportunity to understand each other better and to work together on areas of mutual interests. The substantive and effective growth of the comprehensive partnership between the two countries have been, and will be, delivering benefits to our two peoples and contributing to the maintenance of peace, stability, cooperation, and prosperity in the region and the world.

The two sides will also promote the momentum for development of the economic, trade, and investment relations on the basis of mutual interest, minimize the trade and investment disputes, and will continue to effectively implement the economic and trade agreements that we have signed.We'll also strengthen cooperation in science and technology, environment, climate change, humanitarian issues, human resources development, and expanding people-to-people exchange for the enhanced comprehensive partnership, the interest of the two peoples and for the benefit of peace, stability, cooperation, and development in the region and the world.Thank you.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAssessment of the future outlook of the Vietnam-U.S. relationship.\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

There was some uncertainty that brewed back in the United States over your statement that you said, When he says\u2014when he tells me that, I believe that he means it. That was taken in some circles, including Senator John McCain, to think that you believe that he is saying he did not interfere in the election. Could you, once and for all, definitively, sir\u2014yes or no\u2014say whether or not you believe that President Putin and/or Russia interfered in the election?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWhat I said there\u2014I'm surprised that there's any conflict on this. What I said there is that I believe he believes that, and that's very important for somebody to believe. I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election.As to whether I believe it or not, I'm with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with their leadership. I believe in our intel agencies, our intelligence agencies. I've worked with them very strongly. There weren't seventeen as was previously reported; there were actually four. But they were saying there was seventeen; there were actually four. But as currently led by fine people, I believe very much in our intelligence agencies.Now, at the same time, I want to be able\u2014because I think it's very important\u2014to get along with Russia, to get along with China, to get along with Vietnam, to get along with lots of countries, because we have a lot of things we have to solve. And frankly, Russia and China in particular can help us with the problem, which is one of our truly great problems.So I'm not looking to stand and start arguing with somebody when there's reporters all around and cameras recording and seeing our conversation. I think it was very obvious to everybody. I believe that President Putin really feels\u2014and he feels strongly\u2014that he did not meddle in our election. What he believes is what he believes.What I believe is that we have to get to work. And I think everybody understood this that heard the answer. We have to get to work to solve Syria, to solve , to solve Ukraine, to solve terrorism.And, you know, people don't realize Russia has been very, very heavily sanctioned. They were sanctioned at a very high level, and that took place very recently. It's now time to get back to healing a world that is shattered and broken. Those are very important things. And I feel that having Russia in a friendly posture, as opposed to always fighting with them, is an asset to the world and an asset to our country, not a liability.And by the way, Hillary Clinton had the reset button. She wanted to get back together with Russia. She even spelled reset wrong. That's how it started, and then it got worse. President Obama wanted to get along with Russia, but the chemistry wasn't there. Getting along with other nations is a good thing, not a bad thing, believe me. It's a good thing, not a bad thing.Okay, second.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nCan you definitively state whether or not you believe that President Putin and/or Russia interfered in the election?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Yes, my name is Moon\u2014[inaudible]. I'm affiliated to Dong-A Ilbo Daily Newspaper. I have a question for President Moon: Between Korea and the United States, I think one of the most important diplomatic challenges would be to overcome\u2014to resolve the nuclear problem of the D.P.R.K. And you gave a foreign press interview; you talked about bringing balance and diplomacy, and you talked about resolving nuclear problem and the close cooperation between Korea and the United States, and you talked about the China's role.Are you referring to the balance between the U.S.\u2014balance of Korea between U.S. and China, or are you referring to something else? And you have had a third summit meeting at the summit meeting you just had. You said that you have agreed to bring permanent peace to\u2014[inaudible]\u2014on the Korean Peninsula. And what kind of role are you expecting the United States and President Trump to play with regards to settling peace on the Korean Peninsula?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes, on the bringing balance in our diplomatic approaches, this is not about our stance vis-\u00e0-vis the United States and the China. We are trying to bring a solution to the nuclear problem\u2014D.P.R.K. nuclear problem\u2014and to bring permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula.And moreover, we would like to promote peace, stability, and prosperity of the Northeast Asian region. So we would like to expand our diplomatic efforts in this regard. And that should include our efforts for China, as well as ASEAN and Russia and the EU. I believe that we should diversify efforts\u2014diplomatic efforts\u2014so that we can pursue a more balanced approach. So that was the intention of making such comments.And to establish permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula and to overcome and to resolve the nuclear problem, I think there's role to be played by the United States and China. And when it comes to the United States, a very strong sanctions and pressure is being put by the United States. The U.S. is leading efforts, and I am very sure that substantive results will be realized through such efforts. And China has also faithfully implemented the U.N. resolution to impose sanctions on D.P.R.K. So we have heightened the pressure and sanctions on D.P.R.K., and I think this will also contribute to resolving the n nuclear problem.And if our international society's efforts bear fruits\u2014if such efforts bear fruits\u2014and if we can really make a turnaround, then I'm sure that we will be able to bring to the table of dialogue. And through such dialogue, I am very confident that we can freeze the nuclear program and ultimately dismantle the weapons program of the D.P.R.K. entirely. And in this, I believe that cooperation from the U.S. and China is essential.And on the establishing a permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula, I don't think it's the right time even that we talk about this issue. Now we should focus on bringing an end to the D.P.R.K. provocations and bringing D.P.R.K. to the table for dialogue. This is the impending challenge that we must address now. So we must focus on the sanctions and pressure. And when there is a turnaround\u2014when the turnaround finally comes\u2014then we should certainly make efforts to further consult each other\u2014Korea and the U.S.\u2014for settling peace on the Korean Peninsula. . I want to just say that President Xi\u2014where we will be tomorrow, China\u2014has been very helpful. We'll find out how helpful soon. But he really has been very, very helpful. So China is out trying very hard to solve the problem with . We hope that Russia, likewise, will be helpful. We also hope that other countries\u2014and we know for a fact that other countries have already started.

Yes, my name is Moon\u2014[inaudible]. I'm affiliated to Dong-A Ilbo Daily Newspaper. I have a question for President Moon: Between Korea and the United States, I think one of the most important diplomatic challenges would be to overcome\u2014to resolve the nuclear problem of the D.P.R.K. And you gave a foreign press interview; you talked about bringing balance and diplomacy, and you talked about resolving nuclear problem and the close cooperation between Korea and the United States, and you talked about the China's role.Are you referring to the balance between the U.S.\u2014balance of Korea between U.S. and China, or are you referring to something else? And you have had a third summit meeting at the summit meeting you just had. You said that you have agreed to bring permanent peace to\u2014[inaudible]\u2014on the Korean Peninsula. And what kind of role are you expecting the United States and President Trump to play with regards to settling peace on the Korean Peninsula?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes, on the bringing balance in our diplomatic approaches, this is not about our stance vis-\u00e0-vis the United States and the China. We are trying to bring a solution to the nuclear problem\u2014D.P.R.K. nuclear problem\u2014and to bring permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula.And moreover, we would like to promote peace, stability, and prosperity of the Northeast Asian region. So we would like to expand our diplomatic efforts in this regard. And that should include our efforts for China, as well as ASEAN and Russia and the EU. I believe that we should diversify efforts\u2014diplomatic efforts\u2014so that we can pursue a more balanced approach. So that was the intention of making such comments.And to establish permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula and to overcome and to resolve the nuclear problem, I think there's role to be played by the United States and China. And when it comes to the United States, a very strong sanctions and pressure is being put by the United States. The U.S. is leading efforts, and I am very sure that substantive results will be realized through such efforts. And China has also faithfully implemented the U.N. resolution to impose sanctions on D.P.R.K. So we have heightened the pressure and sanctions on D.P.R.K., and I think this will also contribute to resolving the n nuclear problem.And if our international society's efforts bear fruits\u2014if such efforts bear fruits\u2014and if we can really make a turnaround, then I'm sure that we will be able to bring to the table of dialogue. And through such dialogue, I am very confident that we can freeze the nuclear program and ultimately dismantle the weapons program of the D.P.R.K. entirely. And in this, I believe that cooperation from the U.S. and China is essential.And on the establishing a permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula, I don't think it's the right time even that we talk about this issue. Now we should focus on bringing an end to the D.P.R.K. provocations and bringing D.P.R.K. to the table for dialogue. This is the impending challenge that we must address now. So we must focus on the sanctions and pressure. And when there is a turnaround\u2014when the turnaround finally comes\u2014then we should certainly make efforts to further consult each other\u2014Korea and the U.S.\u2014for settling peace on the Korean Peninsula. . I want to just say that President Xi\u2014where we will be tomorrow, China\u2014has been very helpful. We'll find out how helpful soon. But he really has been very, very helpful. So China is out trying very hard to solve the problem with . We hope that Russia, likewise, will be helpful. We also hope that other countries\u2014and we know for a fact that other countries have already started. And we've had great dialogue with many other countries, as you know, and they're really helping a lot.So if we get China, if we get Russia\u2014and we have some other countries, but we want to get most of them\u2014we think that things will happen, and they could happen very quickly.This is a problem, by the way, that should have been done over the last 25 years, not now. This is not the right time to be doing it, but that's what I've got. That's what I've got. This is a problem that should have been taken care of a long time ago.Thank you. Thank you.

A question for the President Trump: Today you visited Pyeongtaek military base as you first stop, and we have allocated 9 trillion won for the building of the military base. And there's been a bit of conflict, confrontations with the residents of Pyeongtaek, over the construction of the Pyeongtaek base. So, to Koreans, a lot of taxpayers' money has been put into build the Pyeongtaek base, and a lot of sacrifices have been made to build that base. So you visited the Pyeongtaek base today, and many people talked about free-riding of Korea against security of the United States. So what are your feelings about such talks as you visited the Pyeongtaek base?And another question I have is that people have concerns about Korea passing, although a lot of that has gone away.

Thank you very much. My first question is to President Trump. Mr. President, you've spent the last 2 days reaffirming the U.S.-Japan alliance, and you've begun sketching out this vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific. But in 2 days, you're going to travel to China, a country that is neither free nor open. So my question is, how can the U.S. be a force for freedom and openness in this region without inevitably coming into conflict with China?And then, to the Prime Minister: Mr. Prime Minister, the President has spoken on many occasions in the past about hoping to see the Japanese take a strong role in their own defense. He'd like to sell Japan military equipment, and there have been press reports that the President was disappointed that the Japanese didn't shoot the North Korean missile out of the sky, the one that was shot over Hokkaido. I'm wondering, did this subject come up? And what message did you have for the President about the role you'd like to see Japan take in its defense?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThank you, Mark. I will say, if I could just take a piece of the Prime Minister's answer, he will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States. He will easily shoot them out of the sky, just like we shot something out of the sky the other day in Saudi Arabia, as you saw. And that was a very rapidly moving missile shot out of the sky. That was a needle in the sky, and it was hit immediately and exploded without damage.So one of the things, I think, that's very important is that the Prime Minister of Japan is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment, as he should. And we make the best military equipment, by far. He'll be purchasing it from the United States. Whether it's the F-35 fighter, which is the greatest in the world\u2014total stealth\u2014or whether it's missiles of many different kinds, it's a lot of jobs for us and a lot of safety for Japan and other countries that are likewise purchasing a lot of military equipment from us that, frankly, a year ago and 2 years ago were not.As far as China is concerned, my relationship, as you know, with President Xi is also excellent. I like him a lot. I consider him a friend. He considers me a friend. With that being said, he represents China; I represent the United States. His views are different on things, but they're pretty similar on trade.The problem we have with China is that for decades they've been\u2014you know, it's been a very unfair\u2014let me be very kind to previous administrations\u2014it's been a very unfair trade situation. Our trade deficit is massive. It's hundreds of billions of dollars a year, anywhere from $350 billion to $504 billion, and that doesn't include intellectual property. And we've already started discussions with China because it has to come down. It has to come down. And that has to do with, really, free trade, fair trade, or reciprocal trade.And frankly, I like reciprocal the best of the group. Because when you explain to somebody that you're going to charge tariffs in order to equalize or you're going to do other things, some people that don't get it; they don't like to hear that. But when you say it's going to be reciprocal\u2014that we're going to charge the same as they're charging us\u2014the people that don't want a 5-percent or a 10-percent tariff say, oh, reciprocal is fair\u2014and that could be 100 percent. So it's much more, Mark, understandable when you talk about reciprocal.And reciprocal trade is very important to me. We have many countries, not just China or Japan, or so many others that we see. I mean, we have one country that charges us a hundred-percent tax if we sell things into that country, and yet when they sell the same product into ourcountry, we charge them nothing. Now, I've been against that for a long time, and you will be seeing, we do things about it.Now, it also takes a period of time to do that, because, as you know, you have statutory limitations in time. You have to put out notices. You have to wait 90 days before you can put out the next, and then you have to wait another 120 days, and then a hundred\u2014then a 30-day. Now, much of this has already been caught and caught up. Some of it was unnecessary, statutorily.But you will be seeing things of countries that have been treating the United States and the United States worker and companies\u2014because I view the companies not as a company, I view it as an extension of the worker\u2014but that have been treating our companies, our country, and our workers very unfairly.You will be seeing that the United States will take very, very strong action. It's already started, but most of the legal foundation has now been done. And you're going to see a very big difference, and it's going to happen very soon. Because the United States, by many countries, has been treated very, very unfairly when it comes to trade.Thank you very much. Regarding Japan defense equipment, a lot of them we purchase from the United States. North Korean situation becoming very tough, the Asia-Pacific security situation becoming very tough, we qualitatively and quantitatively, we have to enhance our defense capability. As the President mentioned, F-35A is a case in point. SM-3 Block IIA is another plan for purchase from the United States. Aegis vessels, the quality and the quantity must be enhanced. In that process, we will be buying more from the United States. That is what I am thinking.Now, North Korea: North Korea launched missiles. Immediately after that, we traced them; we were able to grasp and trace where they were going. Missile defense is something which is based upon the cooperation between Japan and the United States. Missile defense system is a cooperation between the two countries. For the intercepting and shooting down, if it is necessary, of course, we will do that\u2014if it is necessary. But in doing so, U.S. and Japan will closely coordinate our actions. Thank you.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat message did the Prime Minister have for President Trump about the role Japan would like to take in its defense?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

I have a question for the Prime Minister in a moment, if I could. But first, sir, you said just a short time ago that Obamacare is virtually dead. Your plans for Graham-Cassidy have not been able to get off the ground in the Senate. There is no idea whether or not it will in early 2018. You've been picking around the edges, to some degree, with Executive orders, some of which, critics say, are helping to destroy Obamacare. So I'm wondering at this point, what is your health care plan, sir? President Trump. Well, if you look at insurance companies and you take a good, strong look at the numbers, you'll see, since the formation of Obamacare, they're up 400 percent, 450 percent, 250 percent, 300 percent. They've made a fortune, the insurance companies.So when I knocked out the hundreds of millions of dollars a month being paid back to the insurance companies by politicians, I must tell you, that wanted me to continue to pay this, I said I'm not going to do it. This is money that goes to the insurance companies to line their pockets, to raise up their stock prices. And they've had a record run. They've had an incredible run, and it's not appropriate.Obamacare is a disaster. It's virtually dead. As far as I'm concerned, it really is dead, and I predicted that a long time ago. It's a concept that doesn't work. And we are very close.We feel we have the votes, and as soon as we're finished with taxes, John\u2014we really feel we have the votes to get block grants into the States, where the States can much better manage this money and much better take care of the people, rather than the Federal Government. The State block grants\u2014we'll do massive block grants into the various States so that the States can run the program.So we feel we have the votes. We're going to be doing that after the taxes. In the meantime, we're involved with a budget, and then after the budget\u2014hopefully, that gets approved\u2014and after the budget, assuming we have the support of all the Republicans\u2014because we'll have no support from the Democrats or almost no support, because they've really become just obstructionists. They have no good policies, and frankly, they're not good politicians, but they're very good obstructionists. And that's what they do well: obstruct.The number of nominees that I have approved by the Democrats are about half of what President Obama had. And when you look at that\u2014and you can look at judicial appointments, look how slow that's going. I'll have 145 ultimately, which is a tremendous number. We'll have 17 Court of Appeals appointments. But they're not getting approved. They're being slow-walked by Schumer and the group of Democrats that really\u2014it's really disgraceful. Even people that they know they're going to approve, they take it right out to the end. They use every single minute, and I think it's a very disgraceful situation.But Obamacare is everything but dead. The people aren't going to take it. The\u2014they're not going to take it. Alaska, they had over a 200-percent increase. In Arizona, they were 116 percent, and I hear going up even higher. And the people aren't going to take that any longer.So I think we're in great shape. I think we have the votes. And we'll be doing that right after the largest tax cuts in the history of our country are approved, hopefully, sometime in the very near future. Q.

Mr. President, in terms of the timetable for tax reform, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has said he wants to get it done by the end of this year. He would make the House stay through the Christmas break in order to get it done. The Senate Majority Leader has said we'll get it done this Congress. Would you be okay if tax reform were not passed until next year as opposed to this year?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I would like to see it be done this year, John.. I would too. . I would like very much to see it be done this year. So we won't go a step further. If we get it done, that's a great achievement.But don't forget it took years for the Reagan administration to get taxes done. I've been here for 9 months, a little more than 9 months. I can say the same thing for health care. If you look at Obama\u2014first of all, you look at Clinton, they weren't able to get it done. You look at other administrations, they weren't able to get it done. President Obama, after a long period of time, was able to finally push it through, but pushed through something that's now failed\u2014it's really failing badly. But again, we're meeting\u2014Democrat, Republican are meeting right now, and right now they're working on something very special.But I have to tell you, I really believe that we have a very good chance, and I think Mitch feels the same way of getting the\u2014\u2014. Yes, let me\u2014\u2014 . \u2014\u2014of getting the taxes done, hopefully, fairly long before the end of the year. That's what we'd like to see.Go ahead.. Could I just add? Yes, let me just\u2014let me just add to what the President said. The goal is to get it done this calendar year. But it is important to remember that Obama signed Obamacare in March of year 2. Obama signed Dodd-Frank in July of year 2. We're going to get this job done, and the goal is to get it done by the end of the year. . And just to finish up for Mitch\u2014and we're 9 months, right? So\u2014[].. Yes. . So we could have a long way to go, but that's okay.Yes. /Office of National Drug Control Policy Director-Designate Thomas A.

Thank you, Mr. President. Trey Yingst with One America News Network. I'd like to ask you: Do you support the plan by people who previously served in your administration, such as the Steve Bannon, to primary Republican candidates in the 2018 elections who do not support your agenda?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I have a very good relationship, as you know, with Steve Bannon. Steve has been a friend of mine for a long time. I like Steve a lot. Steve is doing what Steve thinks is the right thing. Some of the people that he may be looking at, I'm going to see if we talk him out of that, because, frankly, they're great people.What Mitch will tell you is that maybe, with the exception of a few\u2014and that is a very small few\u2014I have a fantastic relationship with the people in the Senate and with the people in Congress. I mean, I have a\u2014with our House of Representatives. I have a great relationship with political people. If you read the papers, you think, I'm, like, on one island and they're, like, on the other. Well, it's not the way it is.We have a fantastic relationship. I'm friends with most of them, I can say. And I don't think anybody could have much of a higher percentage. But I'm friends with most of them. I like and respect most of them, and I think they like and respect me.Just so you understand, the Republican Party is very, very unified. When we get things approved, we have to go through hell because we have no Democrat support, we have nobody. We don't have a vote from the Democrats. As an example, massive tax cuts, we may not get any Democrat votes. Now, we also may get three of four, but we may get no\u2014for massive tax cuts. We're the highest taxed country in the world, and yet we may get no Democrat support. And that's because they're obstructionists, and they just basically want us to do badly, but that's not going to happen.Yes, go ahead.Office of National Drug Control Policy Director-Designate Thomas A.

As you know, what I did with the cuts at the end, which were all going\u2014you know, you're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars a month going right into the pockets of the insurance companies. And I'm very happy with what I did.And because of that, people are talking now. Democrats are talking to the Republicans for a short-term taking care of, what we will call, health care so that people can have good health care without big spikes. You would have had massive spikes\u2014you already have. I mean, every year the massive spikes to Obamacare have been ridiculous.As far as\u2014and I didn't speak to Mitch about this today, but a priority of mine\u2014and you know that this is coming up\u2014will be the cost of prescription drugs. We are going to get the costs way down, way down, and those drugs companies\u2014so you have the insurance companies, in the one case; in the other case\u2014actually, with regard to both, you have the drug companies.They contribute massive amounts of money to political people. I don't know, Mitch, maybe even to you. [] But I have to tell you, they contribute massive amounts of money. Me, I'm not interested in their money. I don't need their money. I will tell you, you have prescription drugs\u2014you go to England, you go to various places, Canada\u2014you go to many, many countries, and the same exact pill from the same company, the same box, same everything, is a tiny fraction of what it costs in the United States.We are going to get drug prices\u2014prescription drug prices\u2014way down, because the world has taken advantage of us. The world has taken advantage of us when that happens, so that's going to be very important.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat specifically would you like to see both of those types of companies do?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}
