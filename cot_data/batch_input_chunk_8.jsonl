Mr. President, with this newly emerging syndrome now among young children, what do you say to parents who would like to get their children back to school, but are now looking at this and potentially afraid to do that?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, again it's a tiny percentage. But you're right, so we're looking into it very strongly. And the admiral, as he said, he's known about this for long before this happened. But it is a very, very small percentage. And people recover from that; the children recover from that. Right? Yes, sir. Most do recover from this, but it is a serious, and it can be a fatal, condition. So we do want to make sure that parents understand that high fevers, red rashes, particularly on your child, you may need to contact your health care provider. There are treatments for this. They work very effectively if gotten early, at least for the vast majority of the cases. The President. We're studying that very closely, and it's been on the radar for weeks actually, because we've seen this for quite a while. But it's been very rare, but we're looking at it very closely. It's very important to us.I think one of the things we're most proud of is\u2014this just came out\u2014deaths per 100,000 people, death\u2014so deaths per 100,000 people: Germany and the United States are at the lowest rung of that ladder. Meaning, low is a positive, not a negative. Germany and the United States are the two best in deaths per 100,000 people, which, frankly, to me, that's perhaps the most important number there is.Please, go in the back, please./\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat do you say to parents who would like to get their children back to school, but are now looking at this newly emerging syndrome among young children and potentially afraid to do that?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions: one on the Ahmaud Arbery case and one on the coronavirus. The first on the coronavirus: The Vice President is said to be in some sort of self-isolating\u2014keeping his distance from people. What do you say to Americans who say: How can you keep me safe? How can you reopen the government, if even the Vice President is self-isolating? And why hasn't testing gotten up to the point where every American who wants to test can get a test?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, the Vice President, first of all, has been tested, and he's negative\u2014and was tested yesterday, tested today, and he's negative. He's in very good shape. And I think that that's going to be fine.As far as Americans getting a test, they should all be able to get a test right now. They should be able to get a test. That's the problem with a question like that. We go through a whole announcement saying We're number one in the world by far, by a factor of two, and even three and four depending on where you're looking, and I get a question, When will everybody be able to get tested? If somebody wants to be tested right now, they'll be able to be tested.As far as the incident, I think it's horrible, and it's certainly being looked at by many people. I'm speaking to many people about it. He looked\u2014I saw the picture of him in his tuxedo; it was so beautiful. I mean, he looks like a wonderful, young guy. Would have been a wonderful\u2014I mean, just a wonderful guy. I think it's a horrible thing. I think it's a horrible thing.Now, with that being said, as you know, they're studying the case very carefully. They're interviewing everybody involved, and we'll see what happens. To me, it's a very sad thing.I spoke to a number of people that are very much involved in it. I've been following that one very closely. It breaks your heart to watch it. It breaks your heart. And certainly, the video was a\u2014it was a terrible-looking video to me.But you have a lot of people looking at it, and hopefully, an answer is going to be arrived at very quickly. But it's something that is heartbreaking.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nQuestion on the coronavirus: What do you say to Americans who say, How can you keep me safe?

President Trump, thank you. I have two questions, one on testing and one on Democratic States that you've tweeted about. First, the money for this new testing support today comes from the CARE Act\u2014CARES Act, which you signed into law 42 days ago. Did your delay in embracing widespread testing have anything to do with the desire to suppress the official number of U.S. cases and deaths as you try to reopen the country?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNo, we just wanted to make sure that we had the proper machinery apparatus and everything else out there before people started wasting money. It's a method of saving money. We wanted to make sure we had even things like this. Plus, they have machines that are far more complex than this. They have massive machines at some of the laboratories that can do millions of tests. We wanted to make sure everything was in place.

Yes, but does this\u2014the models, sir, are projecting now 130,000 cases that go through August. Is that\u2014do you agree with those models? Is that your expectation as well?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, the models haven't been exactly accurate. These are models done by a lot of think tanks, a lot of universities. If you look at some of the models, they have been way off. Few of the models have been accurate.But as far as the models are concerned, if you go by the model, we were going to lose 2.2 million people. And because we took\u2014we mitigated\u2014we did things that were very tough for our country to do, frankly. We had to turn off our whole magnificent economy. We had to turn down the whole country. We're at the lowest of all of the models.I mean, if you look at, I guess, one-hundred-and-twenty\u2014100- to 120,000 people would be at the low side. And we're at\u2014there's nothing low. Look, nothing low. One is too many people. And I say it all the time: One person to lose for this is too many people. It's a disgrace what happened.But if you look at the models, we're at a low\u2014at the lowest of those projections. But the models are not models done necessarily by the White House. They're models done by many people all over the world. And if you take the most respected of those people, many of those models are wrong. I mean, they've been wrong as far as the U.S. is concerned, because those numbers are nowhere near what was projected, potentially.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo you agree with the models projecting 130,000 cases through August?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

But can you address why it is the correct time to do this now in the middle of a pandemic?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, we're going to be dealing with countries, and we're going to be dealing with leaders of different parts of the world. We spend $500 million a year. We have for many years\u2014more, far more, than anybody else, including China.And I mean, look, I read off a long list of problems that we have. And we've had problems with them for years. It doesn't matter\u2014we're looking at a term of 60 to 90 days. We're doing a very thorough investigation right now as we speak. But this should have been done by previous administrations a long time ago. And when you look at the mistakes that were made\u2014all of the mistakes that were made\u2014it's just something we have to look at.And it is very China-centric. I told that to President Xi. I said, The is very China-centric. Meaning, whatever it is, China was always right. You can't do that. You can't do that. Not right. And we spend\u2014and again, it's not a question of money. But when we're spending $500 million and China is spending $38 million, $34 million, $40 million\u2014$42 million, in a case. It's\u2014again, not money, but it's not right.So we'll see. This is an evaluation period. But in the meantime, we're putting a hold on all funds going to World Health. We will be able to take that money and channel it to the areas that most need it. And that's another way of doing it, but we have not been treated properly.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhy is it the correct time to do this now in the middle of a pandemic?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

They need the Federal Government not only for funding\u2014and I'm not saying take it away\u2014but they need it for advice. They'll need, maybe, equipment that we have.

Nobody ever thought a thing\u2014in all fairness to previous administrations, nobody ever thought anything like this was going to happen, but it did happen.No, the Governors will be very, very respectful of the Presidency. Again, this isn't me; this is the Presidency. The Presidency has such a great importance, in terms of what we're doing. And you can talk about Constitution, you can talk about federalism, you can talk about whatever you want, but the best way\u2014I'm talking now from a managerial standpoint\u2014is to let individual Governors run individual States and come to us if they have difficulty and we will help them.Yes, John []./\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWould you consider taking away their Federal funding?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Non-Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

I mean, I don't want to go into names because, for some, it would be a little bit embarrassing. But I'm studying other countries as we go along.So, on that, we have looked at every country that's opened, some successfully, some okay. No total disaster, but some okay. And some have to go back to the hotspot and fix the hotspot. We think we're going to do it very successfully.Again, we have one country, but we have lots of different pieces. It's a puzzle. We have beautiful pieces, beautiful States with capable Governors. They know when it's time to open.And we don't want to put pressure on anybody. I'm not going to put any pressure on any governor to open. I'm not going to say to Governor Cuomo, You've got to open within 7 days. I want him to take his time, do it right, and then open New York. I'm not putting any pressure on the Governors. Some of them don't need pressure or not pressure. I mean, they're ready to go.And that's a good thing.So we'll open it up in beautiful, little pieces as it comes along. Please, go ahead.

What's your assurance to workers who are asked to go back to work, but are fearful of doing so?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, that's going to be up to the Governors. The Governors are going to want to make sure everything is safe. Now, I think that companies can do testing on a, maybe, weekly basis; you don't have to do it every day with the same worker, but they can do testing. They can do temperature gauges. They can do a lot of different things.And you know, we're only talking about for a period of time. You know, eventually, we want to get back to where we were. We want people actually sitting next to each other in ballgames, eventually. You know, we're not going to rip out every other seat in baseball stadiums and football stadiums. We want to go back to where we were.I want people to understand that. We're not going to be like the way you are. We have 300 reporters in the back that want to sit. Look at the\u2014look at this, the way this looks. I don't even like the way it looks, although I have a lot fewer reporters; that's okay with me.But look at the way this looks. I've never seen anything\u2014John, I've never seen anything quite like it. But there are a lot of people\u2014we don't want this. I don't want this. I don't want this.Eventually, we're going back, where restaurants that had 150 seats are going to have 150 seats, not 50 seats, because they can't make it at 50 seats. But more importantly, the atmosphere is even better. We have to get used to it. We have to get used to. I don't know that people are going to be shaking hands as readily. Some will.I said to some of the hospital people today, So will people be shaking hands again? And I must say, I was a little surprised most of them said, Probably, because there is some kind of a thing to it. I was never a big hand shaker, but when I ran for politics, I said, I think I better start shaking people's hands.Go ahead, John.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAssurance to workers who are asked to go back to work, but are fearful of doing so.\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Non-Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Mr. President, Ross Palombo from ABC News Miami. As a relatively new Floridian, what is your message today to the cruise line industry and the travel industry that Florida depends upon? And since Senator Rick Scott and Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gim\u00e9nez have the same exposure as you, and they are self-isolating, what's your message to them, that they shouldn't be?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I don't know that I had exposure, but I don't have any of the symptoms.And we do have a White House doctor and, I should say, many White House doctors, frankly. And I asked them that same question, and they said, You don't have any symptoms whatsoever. And we don't want people without symptoms to go and do the test. The test is not insignificant.As far as the cruise line business, we're with them all the way. It's a great business. It's a great U.S. business, frankly. And I know how important they are to the country. That includes airlines. But the cruise line business, obviously, was hit very hard.We had a tremendous success out in Oakland where we moved it. Vice President Pence did a fantastic job with that. We worked with U.K. We worked with Canada. They took their people back. And Canada has approximately 600 people; U.K., likewise, took a large number of people back to the United Kingdom.And we have people quarantined. It was a big operation, and it worked out really\u2014you don't hear about it anymore. It worked out really well.Mike, you may even want to say something about that because that was really done properly. Well, thank you, Mr. President. And that program with the Grand Princess, the ship, is continuing to be administered in the highest standards, orderly way, as the President directed. And Americans that needed treatment have received them.[]And what the President has directed us to do is, whether there is a pause in the moment, as some cruise lines are doing, and as we all continue to discuss, we want to work with the cruise line industry to ensure that when we come through this, that cruise lines and the medical services that are available, and for the passengers and all of the crew, that cruise lines are safer than ever before and can prosper for many years to come.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nMr. President, as a relatively new Floridian, what is your message today to the cruise line industry and the travel industry that Florida depends upon?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

That was a big decision. It was a hard decision because it had never been done before anyway. I mean, not even early or late. It had never been made, a decision like that.

The Taliban has given a pledge\u2014and a very strong pledge\u2014and we'll see how that all works out. We hope it's going to work out very well. I think they have big incentives to do it, but they have to take care of the terrorists and kill the terrorists. We'll be working in a different kind of a fashion toward that end.But the job we've done has been fantastic\u2014a fantastic one in terms of terrorists and terrorism, and it's time for our people to start coming home.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nIs the Taliban in charge?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Yes, the case\u2014again, this is why we're talking about the community cases with no link to travel. So the investigation at this time shows no evidence of link to travel or a known contact. Q. Okay. And also, you said that Americans as a whole are at a low risk. Are Americans on the West Coast of the United States at a low risk? And are you considering restricting travel within the United States?Director Redfield. So I just want to emphasize again that the Americans, independent of where they live in this Nation, are at low risk. All right? And we're going to continue to evaluate aggressively these unlinked cases as we see them. And as we learn, we'll obviously communicate that.Border Security/Mexico's Immigration Enforcement Cooperation With U.S./Coronavirus Containment Efforts  Q. Thank you so much, Mr. President.
