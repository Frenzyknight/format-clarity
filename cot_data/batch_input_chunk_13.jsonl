So point blank, Democrats go after your tax returns, will you try to block that or will you allow them to have them?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, look, as I have told you, they're under audit. They have been for a long time. They're extremely complex. People wouldn't understand them. They're done by among the biggest and best law firms in the country. Same thing with the accounting firms. The accountants are\u2014a very, very large, powerful firm, from the standpoint of respect. They're highly respected, big firm. A great law firm. Or you know it very well. They do these things; they put them in. But people don't understand tax returns. Now, I did do a filing of over a hundred pages, I believe, which is in the offices. And when people went and saw that filing and they saw the magnitude of it, they were very disappointed. And they saw the\u2014you know, the detail. You'd get far more from that. And I guess we filed that now three times. But you get far more from that than you could ever get from a tax return.But when you're under audit\u2014and I'm on a very continuous audit, because there are so many companies, and it is a very big company\u2014far bigger than you would even understand. But it's a great company, but it's big, and it's complex. And it's probably feet high. It's a very complex instrument.And I think that people wouldn't understand it. But if I were finished with the audit, I would have an open mind to it. I would say that. But I don't want to do it during the audit. And really, no lawyer\u2014even from the other side, they say often\u2014not always\u2014but when you're under audit, you don't have\u2014you don't subject it to that. You get it done, and then you release it.So when that happens, if that happens, I would certainly have an open mind to it.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWill you try to block Democrats from obtaining your tax returns, or will you allow them to have them?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

They know him very well. But here, there was nothing to investigate from at least one standpoint. They didn't know the location. They didn't know the time. They didn't know the year. They didn't know anything. And it's like, where do you go?Also, it's not for the FBI. If you look at what Joe Biden said, he said, They don't do this. And he said it very clearly. So I think when you really look at it all, it's not going to change any of the Democrats' minds. They're obstructionists. They're actually con artists, because they know how quality this man is, and they've destroyed a man's reputation and they want to destroy it even more.And I think people are going to see that in the midterms. What they've done to this family, what they've done to these children\u2014these beautiful children of his\u2014and what they've done to his wife. And they know it's a big, fat con job. And they go into a room, and I guarantee you, they laugh like hell at what they've pulled off on you and on the public. They laugh like hell.So, it wouldn't have mattered if the FBI came back with the cleanest score. And you understand that very well, John. If they would have come back with the most perfect\u2014We found everything, and he's perfectly innocent of everything. It wouldn't have made a difference. You wouldn't have gotten one vote.Now we will get votes from the Democrats if we win. You'll have three, four, or five Democrats giving us votes, because they're in States that I won by 30 and 40 points, and they're going to give us votes. But other than that, you probably won't get any, John.Yes, go ahead.

I just heard about one a little while ago. I can tell you her lawyer is a low life, okay? So I can't tell you whether or not they're liars until I hear them.I don't know what happened today because I've been very busy with Japan, with South Korea, with , and about seven other countries, as you know, and I chaired the Security Council. So I don't know about today's person that came forward. I do know about the lawyer. And you don't get much worse, bad reputation too. Take a look at his past.So, as far as the other women are concerned, I'm going to see what happens tomorrow. I'm going to be watching\u2014you know, believe it or not. I'm going to see what's said. It's possible that they will be convincing.Now, with all of that being said, Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been, for many years, one of the most respected people in Washington. He's been on, I guess you'd call it, the second highest court. And every single person knows him; a lot of people know him well. And those people don't believe what's going on.

I'm meeting with a lot of countries tomorrow, but I will certainly, in some form, be able to watch.

[]And he may have had a bad past, who knows, you know. [] He may have had some, I think, accusations made. Didn't he have a couple of things in his past? George Washington would be voted against 100 percent by Schumer and the con artists. I mean, 100 percent. One hundred percent.So it really doesn't matter from their standpoint. That's why when John asked about the FBI. If the FBI did the most thorough investigation in the history of the FBI and they found him to be 100-percent perfect, he would lose every single vote.Now, if the Republicans win tomorrow, I think you're going to get some votes from the Democrats.

You know why? Because I've had a lot of false charges made against me. I'm a very famous person, unfortunately. I've been a famous person for a long time. But I've had a lot of false charges made against me, really false charges. I know friends that have had false charges. People want fame. They want money. They want whatever. So when I see it, I view it differently than somebody sitting home watching television, where they say, Oh, Judge Kavanaugh . . . this or that.It's happened to me many times. I've had many false charges; I had a woman sitting in an airplane, and I attacked her while people were coming onto the plane. And I have a number-one bestseller out? I mean it was total phony story. There are many of them.So when you say, does it affect me in terms of my thinking with respect to Judge Kavanaugh? Absolutely. Because I've had it many times.And if the news would have reported these four people\u2014I couldn't believe it. When I heard that they caught these four people, I said: Wow. That's a big story. And it was\u2014for Fox.

Are you planning to fire Rod Rosenstein?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI'm talking to him. We've had a good talk. He said he never said it. He said he doesn't believe it. He said he has a lot of respect for me, and he was very nice, and we'll see. And he's a member of the Trump administration, in that sense; it's the Justice Department.I would certainly prefer not doing that. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction\u2014I mean, unless you call obstruction the fact that I fight back. I do fight back. I really fight back. I mean, if you call that obstruction, that's fine.But there's no obstruction. There's no collusion. I'm going to meet with him tomorrow. I may call Rod tonight or tomorrow and ask for a little bit of a delay to the meeting, because I don't want to do anything that gets in the way of this very important Supreme Court pick. So I don't want it competing and hurting the decision\u2014one way or the other decision. Again, I want to hear what she has to say.But I want to do\u2014so I may delay that. I'm going to see. I don't want to do anything that's going to conflict with that. But my preference would be to keep him and to let him finish up.You know, I call it a witch hunt. And it is a witch hunt. If you look at the FBI statements with Strzok and his lover Lisa Page. If you look at all of the things that have gone on in the FBI. If you look at McCabe taking $700,000 from a Hillary Clinton PAC, essentially run by Terry McAuliffe, who's her best friend in the world, and he gives them hundreds of thousands of dollars. And he's in charge of her campaign, and his wife is getting all of this money to run\u2014she lost\u2014to run. [] I mean, what's going on?If you look at the horrible statements, like: Way to go, Page. Great story you put into a newspaper. Essentially, now we'll go and investigate that group. It's terrible. We have caught people doing things that are terrible. I would much prefer keeping Rod Rosenstein. Much prefer. Many people say I have the right to absolutely fire him. He said he did not say it. He said he does not believe that. And nobody in this room believes it.By the way, I deal with the people in this room. I was with Mike Pompeo before, and we were dealing, at a very high level, with Japan. And I was saying things that nobody in the room even understood. And I said them a long time ago, and I was right. He said, That's not the 25th Amendment that I'm looking at. I think I can say that from Mike.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAre you planning to fire Rod Rosenstein?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}
