Thank you, Mr. President. You put the Vice President in charge of coronavirus coordination across the Government. When he was Governor of Indiana, the Vice President allowed HIV outbreak to spiral out of control because he did not heed the advice of his public health professional advisers who said the needle exchange was necessary at the beginning of the outbreak.What guarantee can you give Americans that political considerations and ideological issues will play no role in your Government's response to this virus?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, let me just respond quickly, and then I'm going to have Mike say something about that, because I've heard very good explanations, actually.When it came to health care, Indiana has been a leader, an absolute leader. And it was really started with others, but by Mike Pence, and he's done a phenomenal job on health care. One of the best, if not the best, in the country.And with that, I'll let Mike respond specifically, if you want to. Sure. Thank you, Mr. President. When I was Governor of the State of Indiana, we actually had two experiences with the spread of infectious diseases. The first was in 2014, when Indiana was where the very first MERS case in the United States arrived. Obviously, an infectious disease much more deadly than the coronavirus that we're dealing with today.It was then, when I was Governor, that I learned of the extraordinary capabilities of CDC. I worked with my health officials in the State of Indiana. I worked with Federal officials and, maybe most importantly, learned the invaluable role that local health officials play in dealing with the spread of infectious disease.I'm proud to say that the State of Indiana secured that patient, found out everyone they'd ever contacted. There were no additional infections, and that patient recovered. There was only one other MERS disease.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nThe guarantee that political considerations and ideological issues will play no role in the Government's response to the virus.\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

The White House has spent the day denying that they are going to appoint a czar to run point on the coronavirus response. Today the\u2014Secretary Azar testified that he didn't think one was necessary; they were going to run it out of HHS. And you yourself have been downplaying this. So why are you now selecting the Vice President to run point on this?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, Mike is not a czar. He's Vice President. He's in the administration. But I'm having everybody report to Mike. Mike has been very good, very adept. Anybody that knows anything about health care, they look at the Indiana model, and it's been a very great success. It's been a tremendous model in terms of health care. And this is really an offshoot of that.So this isn't a czar. I don't view Mike as a czar. Mike is part of the administration. But I'm having them report to Mike. Mike will report to me.They'll also be reporting, in some cases, to both. I'll be going to meetings quite a bit depending on what they want to do and what message we want to get out. But we've done, really, an extraordinary job. When you look at a country this size, with so many people pouring in\u2014we're the number one in the world for people coming into a country, by far. And we have a total of 15 cases, many of which, or most\u2014within a day, I will tell you most of whom are fully recovered. I think that's, really, a pretty impressive mark.Now, we did take in 40 people that were Americans, and they're also recovering. But we brought them in, so I call that\u2014I have a different group. But we felt we had an obligation to American citizens outside of the country that were trying to get back in.

I think they look at the people that you watched debating last night, and they say, if there's even a possibility that can happen, I think it really takes a hit because of that. And it certainly took a hit because of this, and I understand that also, because of supply chains and various other things and people coming in.But I think the stock market will recover. The economy is very strong. The consumer is the strongest it's ever been. Our consumers are incredible. They're incredible. That's why we're doing well, and other countries have not, even before the virus. We're doing great. Other countries have not been doing great.

I think they look at the people that you watched debating last night, and they say, if there's even a possibility that can happen, I think it really takes a hit because of that. And it certainly took a hit because of this, and I understand that also, because of supply chains and various other things and people coming in.But I think the stock market will recover. The economy is very strong. The consumer is the strongest it's ever been. Our consumers are incredible. They're incredible. That's why we're doing well, and other countries have not, even before the virus. We're doing great. Other countries have not been doing great.

I think Speaker Pelosi is incompetent. She lost the Congress once. I think she's going to lose it again. She lifted my poll numbers up 10 points. I never thought that I would see that so quickly and so easily.I'm leading everybody. We're doing great. I don't want to do it that way. It's almost unfair if you think about it. But I think she's incompetent, and I think she's not thinking about the country. And instead of making a statement like that, where I've been beating her routinely at everything\u2014instead of making a statement like that, she should be saying we have to work together, because we have a big problem, potentially. And maybe it's going to be a very little problem. I hope that it's going to be a very little problem. But we have to work together.Instead, she wants to do that\u2014same thing with Cryin' Chuck Schumer. He goes out, and he says: The President only asked for $2\u00bd billion. He should have 8\u00bd. This is the first time I've ever been told that we should take more. Usually, it's we have to take less.And we should be working together. He shouldn't be making statements like that, because it's so bad for the country. And Nancy Pelosi\u2014I mean, she should go back to her district and clean it up, because it's the number one\u2014if you look at percentage down, that was one of the finest in the world, and now you look at what's happening.And I'm just saying, we should all be working together. She's trying to create a panic, and there's no reason to panic, because we have done so good. These professionals behind me and over here and over there and back here, and in some conference rooms\u2014I just left a group of 45 people that are the most talented people in the world. Parts of the world are asking us, in a very nice way, can they partake and help them.So Nancy Pelosi shouldn't\u2014and she knows it's not true. She knows it\u2014all they're trying to do is get a political advantage. This isn't about political advantage. We're all trying to do the right thing. They shouldn't be saying: This is terrible. President Trump isn't asking for enough money. How stupid a thing to say. If they want to give us more money, that's okay; we'll take more money. Some Republicans think we should have more money too. That's okay. We'll take more money. But they shouldn't demean the people that are on the stage, who are the finest in the world. They're not demeaning me.

But coming from you, it has more weight. Do you feel like U.S. schools should be preparing for a coronavirus spreading?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI would think so, yes. I mean, I haven't spoken specifically about that with the various doctors, but I would think so, yes. I think every aspect of our society should be prepared. I don't think it's going to come to that, especially with the fact that we're going down, not up. We're going very substantially down, not up.But yes, I think schools should be preparing and, you know, get ready just in case. The words are just in case. We don't think we're going to be there. We don't think we're going to be anywhere close. And again, if you look at some countries, they are coming down. It's starting to go in the other direction.This will end. This will end. You look at flu season. I said, 26,000 people? I've never heard of a number like that. Twenty-six thousand people going up to sixty-nine thousand people, Doctor, you told me before. Sixty-nine thousand people die every year\u2014from 26 [26,000; .] to 69 [69,000; .]\u2014every year from the flu. Now, think of that. It's incredible.So far, the results of all of this that everybody is reading about\u2014and part of the thing is, you want to keep it the way it is. You don't want to see panic, because there's no reason to be panicked about.But when I mentioned the flu, I said\u2014actually, I asked the various doctors. I said, Is this just like flu? Because people die from the flu. And this is very unusual. And it is a little bit different, but in some ways it's easier and in some ways it's a little bit tougher.But we have it so well under control. I mean, we really have done a very good job.Go ahead.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nShould U.S. schools be preparing for a coronavirus spreading?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

You know, we're not going to loosen the travel restrictions. That's what saved us. Had I not made\u2014Mike alluded to it\u2014had I not made a decision very early on not to take people from a certain area, we wouldn't be talking this way. We'd be talking about many more people would have been infected.I took a lot of heat. I mean, some people called me racist because I made a decision so early. And we had never done that as a country before, let alone early. So it was a, you know, bold decision. It turned out to be a good decision. But I was criticized by the Democrats. They called me a racist because I made that decision, if you can believe that one.We have to all work together.

You want to stay\u2014if you're not feeling well, if you feel you have a flu, stay inside, sort of quarantine yourself. Don't go outside.But there are certain steps that you can take that won't even be necessary. You know, in many cases, when you catch this, it's very light; you don't even know there's a problem. Sometimes, they just get the sniffles; sometimes, they just get something where they're not feeling quite right. And sometimes, they feel really bad.But that's a little bit like the flu.

Two weeks ago, Mr. President, your Acting OMB Director was in this room and was talking about what he expects to be GDP growth for this coming year. He said it was 3 percent. And we've talked about the effects of the coronavirus on the supply chain, the declines in the financial markets. Are you still confident that you'll see that kind of economic growth this year?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNo, we're going to have tremendously low unemployment. We're setting records on that one. In fact, the administration has the\u2014as you know, the lowest average unemployment of any administration in history. Our numbers are very low, very good\u20143.5, 3.6. But you can't really see what this does in terms of GDP.It could affect it, but that's irrelevant compared to what we're talking about. We want to make sure it's safe. Safety, number one.But this would have, you know, an impact on GDP. But we're still very, very\u2014we're doing great. But this will\u2014just like\u2014I'll tell you what has a big impact: Boeing has a big impact. How did that happen? A year ago, all of a sudden, that happened. I think that took away a half a point to a point, even. You know, it's a massive company. I think Boeing\u2014we had the General Motors strike; that was a big impact on GDP.And of course, we're paying interest rates. I disagree with the head of the Fed. I'm not happy with what that is, because he's kept interest rates. President Obama didn't have near the numbers. And yet, if you look at what happened, he was paying zero. We're paying interest. Now, it's more conservative. And frankly, people that put their money away are now getting a return on their money as opposed to not getting anything.But I think, you know, we're the greatest of them all. We should be paying the lowest interest rates. And when Germany and other countries are paying negative rates\u2014meaning, they're literally getting paid when they put out money. I mean, they borrow money, and they get paid when it gets paid back. Who ever heard of this before? It's a first. But we don't do that.So I totally disagree with our Fed. I think our Fed has made a terrible mistake, and it would have made a big difference, as good as we've done, even without the 2,000 points. And we started off at 16,000, and we'll be at 28,000 without. We were going to crack 30,000. We have had increases like nobody has seen before. But we're doing well. But we have to watch\u2014we're doing well, anyway, in other words, even despite the 2,000 points. It sounds like a lot, and it's a lot. But it's nothing\u2014it's very little compared to what we've gone up.But we'll be watching it very closely. But we have been hurt by General Motors. We've been hurt by Boeing. And we've hurt by\u2014we've been hurt, in my opinion, very badly, by our own Federal Reserve, who has also created a very strong dollar. That's something nice about a strong dollar, but it makes it much harder to do business outside of this country.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAre you still confident that you'll see that kind of economic growth this year?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

If you got Ebola, that was it.This one is different. Much different. This is a flu. This is like a flu. And this is a much different situation than Ebola.But\u2014and we're working on Ebola right now, by the way. We're working on certain areas of the Congo. The Congo has Ebola and caused largely by the fact that they have war and people can't get there. We can now treat Ebola. In that\u2014at that time, it was infectious, and you couldn't treat it.

Thank you, Mr. President. The intelligence community believes that Russia is trying to meddle in the 2020 election. Do you agree with their assessment? And what is your message to Vladimir Putin about potentially interfering regardless of the candidate they support?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, you know, what I'm reading\u2014and again, I'm over here for the last number of days\u2014but they went to see Bernie, and they told Bernie about something having to do with they want Bernie to win. They did not tell me. Intelligence never told me. And we have a couple of people here that would know very well. They never told me anything about that. And it was sort of a strange thing that they went to Bernie.And now I find out, if I believe what I read in some of your documents, in some of your papers, that it's a highly\u2014it was highly exaggerated. And frankly, I think it's disgraceful. And I think it was leaks from the Intelligence Committee, the House version. And I think that they leaked it. I think probably Schiff leaked it, but some people within that. Schiff leaked it, in my opinion. And he shouldn't be leaking things like that. That's a terrible thing to do.But basically, they would like to see\u2014Bernie is probably winning, and it looks like he's winning. And he's got a head of steam, and they maybe don't want him, for obvious reasons. So they don't want him, so they put out a thing that Russia is backing him. This is what they do.

Thank you, Mr. President. The intelligence community believes that Russia is trying to meddle in the 2020 election. Do you agree with their assessment? And what is your message to Vladimir Putin about potentially interfering regardless of the candidate they support?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, you know, what I'm reading\u2014and again, I'm over here for the last number of days\u2014but they went to see Bernie, and they told Bernie about something having to do with they want Bernie to win. They did not tell me. Intelligence never told me. And we have a couple of people here that would know very well. They never told me anything about that. And it was sort of a strange thing that they went to Bernie.And now I find out, if I believe what I read in some of your documents, in some of your papers, that it's a highly\u2014it was highly exaggerated. And frankly, I think it's disgraceful. And I think it was leaks from the Intelligence Committee, the House version. And I think that they leaked it. I think probably Schiff leaked it, but some people within that. Schiff leaked it, in my opinion. And he shouldn't be leaking things like that. That's a terrible thing to do.But basically, they would like to see\u2014Bernie is probably winning, and it looks like he's winning. And he's got a head of steam, and they maybe don't want him, for obvious reasons. So they don't want him, so they put out a thing that Russia is backing him. This is what they do.

We've got 2 days now under our belt without violence or, I guess, a minimum of violence. And we'll see what happens. But people want to see it.And it's very interesting, that one is. Everybody is happy about it. Even people that are normally against me, like 99.9 percent of the time\u2014[]\u2014because we've been there for 19 years, and everybody would like to see it happen. I was actually surprised. I thought the Schumers of the world would say whatever the opposite is, you know, because that's all they can do. Cryin' Chuck. But people are really\u2014they're really happy to see that we're trying very hard. You know, we're bringing it down to 86\u20148,600. And from there, we'll make a decision as to what the final outcome would be.But there's been tremendous praise for the fact that we're doing something. You know, other administrations have tried to do something. In particular, the previous administration, for a long time, they were never able to get anything done.

And we'll always have intelligence there; we'll have other things there. But we'd like to bring them\u2014for the most part, we'd like to bring them back home. We want to watch the area.

And I asked you this question earlier, at that time, about a Trump doctrine on fighting out Islamic fundamentalism, which you spoke about and you discussed with Prime Minister Modi. And you spoke about a Modi-Trump doctrine. So what is your roadmap to fight out Islamic radical terrorism?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I don't think anybody has done more than I have, if you look. Because I came in, and if you check your maps and look at Iraq and Syria, it was all over. In fact, they had it painted a certain color. I won't tell you what color, because it doesn't matter. Somebody will say it was a Republican color, so I don't want to get people confused. But it was; it happened to be red. [] And it was basically trying to show where ISIS was in those areas. And it was out of control.And I gave the orders, and we have a hundred percent of the caliphate. We have tens of thousands of people in prisons now. They're being guarded by the Kurds and others. Europe should take a lot of them back. So far, they haven't agreed to do that. They should do that because we did them a big favor. We captured them. But I did that.We killed al-Baghdadi a few months ago. And Soleimani was\u2014is gone. He's no longer putting roadside bombs all over the place. Somebody else may be, but he was the father\u2014the king\u2014of the roadside bomb. All of those young people that you see with missing legs and\u2014missing legs and arms. I've seen every combination. The legs are gone. You go over to Walter Reed\u2014I have to say, the doctors at Walter Reed are incredible, what they're able to do. Incredible.But that's what his thing was. He thought that was a beautiful weapon: roadside bombs. It's a coward's bomb. And all of these young people that have been so badly hurt. And we did a big favor.In addition to that, as you know, Hamza bin Laden is now gone. And he was looking to do damage. And he's gone. And Al Qaida, last week, you saw what happened there.So nobody has done more than what I've done. And\u2014but at the same time, Russia should do it. Iran should do it. Iraq should do it. Syria should do it. You know, we're in a different part of the world. We're doing it. Everybody says, You're the only ones that can do it. Well, at some point, these other countries\u2014I mean, Iran should do it. Iran hates ISIS. And they should do it.And we've done a great job. We've taken our soldiers essentially out of Syria, except for little hotspots that we figured, you know, we'll do, that develop. But we've taken the oil. And the soldiers that we have there are the ones guarding the oil. We have the oil. So that's all we have there.And now we have\u2014and if you look, we are down to a small force in Iraq. And we're down to a small force, very shortly\u2014but right now, even, we have a small force in Afghanistan. And so we're moving out and moving around.

While you've been here in the country, in the capital, the northeast part of Delhi, there have been violent clashes. Police have been killed, some demonstrators. Nine deaths so far, we hear, and about a hundred-plus injured. What did Prime Minister Modi say to you about this amended citizenship law? And how concerned are you about this kind of religious violence in India? The President. So we did talk about religious freedom. And I will say that the Prime Minister was incredible on what he told me. He wants people to have religious freedom, and very strongly. And he said that in India they have worked very hard to have great and open religious freedom. And if you look back and look at what's going on, relative to other places especially, but they have really worked hard on religious freedom.I asked that question in front of a very large group of people today. And he talked about it; we talked about it for a long time. And I really believe that's what he wants.As far as the individual attack, I heard about it, but I didn't discuss that with him. That's up to India.Yes, go ahead. Please.Sexual Assault Conviction of Weinstein Company Cochairman Harvey Weinstein  Q. Hi, sir, Emily Goodwin with the DailyMail.com. I was wondering, do you think justice was served in the Harvey Weinstein case?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nSo I was never a fan of Harvey Weinstein, as you know. In fact, he said he was going to work hard to defeat me in the election. How did that work out, by the way? I'm trying to figure that out.He was a person I didn't like, never liked. I don't know too much about the case because, as you know, I've been over here. Between traveling and being at meetings almost every hour of the day, every minute of the day, I haven't been able to really see too much of it.But I was just not a fan of his. I knew him a little bit, not very well. I knew him because he was in New York. Not a person that I like.I will say, the people that liked him were the Democrats. Michelle Obama loved him. Loved him. Hillary Clinton loved him. And he gave tremendous money to the Democrats.And I guess my question is: Will the Democrats be asking for that money back? Because he gave a lot of money to the Democrats. And you know, it's too bad, but that's the way it worked out.Yes, Peter [Peter Alexander, NBC News].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHi, sir, Emily Goodwin with the DailyMail.com.

And is nuclear happening?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nSo we talked about many things\u2014many, many things. We talked about Iran. We talked about Iraq. We talked about\u2014you know, we were together for 2 days. I'm going to be with Prime Minister Modi tonight for a state dinner at 7 o'clock. It starts at 7, I believe.And we talked about exactly all of the things that you're talking about. We also talked about tariffs, because as you know, India is probably the highest tariff nation in the world, meaning charging tariffs to outsiders. And I said, we have to stop that. We have to stop it, at least as it pertains to the United States. And I think we're understanding each other.With China, we worked a deal, and we worked it because of the tariffs. And I was able to leave the tariffs on. That will take care of phase two. We still have 25 percent on $250 billion.But in the meantime, we're working with China very much on the virus. We feel that's something. And I have to tell\u2014I spoke to President Xi the other day. He is so committed to solving that problem. He is\u2014he is working very hard. He is very capable. The country is very capable. And it snuck up on him, but I think he's going to do well.Now you see it's going to South Korea, it's going to Italy, and it's going to other places. But I spoke to all of them. They're all working very, very hard on it.The United States, because of an early decision I made\u2014I made a decision. I believe it was the first time it's ever been done: We closed the country to certain areas, as you know. And I was criticized for that decision. Now they're saying it was a good decision.I think it was a good decision, because we have very few people. And you can add to it a few people that we took in because they're Americans. I mean, what are we going to do? And they were almost in between countries, where people weren't going to take them, and they're Americans. But they're fully quarantined. They call it fully quarantined. So you know, we did the right thing. If you were out there, if you were an American and you refused to have any help from your country\u2014these were wonderful people. It wasn't their fault.So\u2014but we're down to\u2014we're really down to probably 10. Most of the people are outside of danger right now. But we've had a very strict line on the people that were taken\u2014the areas from which we take. And I did it very early. It's never done before, and I did it early. So I think it was a good decision as it turned out. Yes, please.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAnd is nuclear happening?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Sir\u2014[inaudible]\u2014from CNBC TV18 India. American companies have been investing in India for a long, long time. Are you satisfied with the Indian investment rating, especially on issues like multibrand retail and e-commerce on which companies from U.S. have a lot of interest in?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nSo I'm very satisfied because they're investing tremendous amounts of money. I met Mr. Patel a little while ago. He's the largest steel person in the world by far. I don't think there's even a contest. And he's going to be building a billion-dollar plant in Alabama.We had the press\u2014I left them in there. Always a risky thing to do. But if you\u2014if you see the\u2014let's say we ask\u2014you know, answered 15 questions, and they were talking about how much better it is to work in the United States now, in terms of their investment. They have done a fantastic job.These are some of the biggest entrepreneurs in the world. I'm not even sure if the media really understood who they were. I knew many of them, certainly heard of all of them. The job they've done is incredible. But Mr. Patel, who's the biggest steel\u2014I think biggest steel company, certainly the biggest steel individual. But I think he's the biggest steel company by a lot. He's investing billions of dollars in the United States, and he's only doing it because of what I've done to bring back the steel industry. The steel industry was dead. Absolutely dead in the United States. And now it's a vibrant industry. It's incredible, and we need it. Again, we need it for defense. It's not just like certain industries that you don't need. We need it for defense.But he was glowing. And one of the reasons he's spending a billion dollars in Alabama, and more money in other places in the United States, is because we brought it back. So we're very proud of that.So I think what we'll do is we're going to see some of you on the plane on the way back. It's been an honor to be here. It's an incredible place with incredible leadership and an unbelievable future.And I just want to thank you all. And I'll see you back in the States. And I think some of you are on the plane, and we can talk a little bit on the plane too. Thank you very much, everybody.

I think that some people are\u2014they put it at a level that is, you know, unrealistic, to a point you can't live your lives.We want to have the cleanest water on Earth. We want to have the cleanest air on Earth. Our numbers, as you saw\u2014we had record numbers come out very recently. Our numbers are very, very good, our environmental numbers. Our water numbers, our numbers on air are tremendous.We have to do something about other continents. We have to do something about other countries. When we're clean and beautiful and everything is good, but you have another continent where the fumes are rising at levels that you can't believe, I mean, I think Greta ought to focus on those places.But we are doing better right now than we've ever done, in terms of cleanliness, in terms of numbers. We have a beautiful ocean called the Pacific Ocean, where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us, and that's put there by other countries. So I think Greta has to start working on those other countries.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nOpinion on climate change being a hoax\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Can I ask you just to be clear, and for future Presidents: Is abuse of power an impeachable offense?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, you've got to talk to the lawyers about it. But I will tell you: There's nothing here. I had a very innocent conversation with a very fine gentleman from the Ukraine, and it was based on that. People don't even want to talk about the conversation. I got to watch glimpses in between all of these meetings that I just told you about. I got to watch glimpses of what is taking place, wasting time, in Washington.And I watched\u2014they don't talk about my conversation. They don't talk about my transcripts. Remember this: When Schiff made up the phony story, and he repeated it to Congress and the world\u2014and it was a totally phony story\u2014then I released the transcript. There was supposed to be a second whistleblower. What happened to him? There was\u2014wait, wait. Otherwise, I won't do your show. [] Wait. There was supposed to be an informer. What happened to the informer? All of these people disappeared. And when they saw this transcript, they said, We've got problems. But they went ahead because they were already there, because they had a phony, concocted story made up.So here's the story: Did nothing wrong. It was a perfect conversation. It was totally appropriate. The best lawyers in the world have looked at it. The Department of Justice has looked at it, given it a signoff. There was nothing wrong.They never thought I was going to release the conversation. They probably didn't think we had transcribers or we had it transcribed or taped. But they never thought we were going to release it. When we released that conversation, all hell broke out with the Democrats, because they say: Wait a minute. This is much different than Shifty Schiff told us.So we're doing very well. I got to watch enough. I thought our team did a very good job. But honestly, we have all the material. They don't have the material.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nIs abuse of power an impeachable offense?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Non-Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

I ask you because your attorneys say it's not. Alan Dershowitz says the Framers of the Constitution did not permit impeachment on grounds like abuse of power or obstruction. They objected, open-ended, vague criteria.So for future Presidents, is abuse of power an impeachable offense?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, it depends. But if you take a look at this, and from what everybody tells me, all I do is, I'm honest. I make great deals. I've made great deals for our country. Now we're working with the WTO. You're probably surprised by that, but this has been a long-term, abusive situation to the U.S. I make great deals for our country, and they're honest deals.And when you read that transcription\u2014and, by the way, it wasn't one call; it was two calls. Nobody likes to talk about that. There was one call, which was perfect, and then there was a second call\u2014I guess, a couple of months later\u2014which was perfect.The President of Ukraine said it was perfect. The Foreign Minister of Ukraine said it was perfect. So if we have a transcription, we have the call, and we have the person on the other side of the call saying it was good\u2014now, here's the other thing: They got their money long before schedule. They got all their money. What nobody says\u2014this is very important to me: Why isn't Germany paying? Why isn't U.K. paying? Why isn't France paying? Why aren't the European nations paying? Why is it always the sucker\u2014United States? That's one.And the other thing I wanted to check very carefully\u2014and it's very important\u2014is corruption. And we do that too. This was a perfect call, and I think we're doing very well.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nIs abuse of power an impeachable offense for future Presidents?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

They formed their airplane company, which does very nicely, and now is doing better than ever, because Boeing has not had a good time of it. They have\u2014they'd better start recovering fast. I hope they do. They have some good people in there now. They have great people in the company, but they have some good people leading it now. So, hopefully, that will be taken care of.But I\u2014no, I have a date in my mind, and it's a fairly quick date. And if we're unable to make a deal, then we'll do even better.

And Kenneth Starr. How do you feel about him now?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nSo Ken Starr is a terrific man. I did make that statement, because, frankly, I didn't think that Bill Clinton should have been impeached. And I thought it was terrible. I didn't know Ken Starr, but I didn't think that Bill Clinton should be impeached\u2014should have been impeached. And I was pretty vocal about that. I didn't know Ken, but what I did know is he was very smart. He was very tough. He was very talented. But in a certain way, I was sticking up for Clinton\u2014for Bill Clinton. And you know, I felt\u2014I sort of still feel that way. I mean, what he did was nothing good. There was a lot of lying going on. There were a lot of things, a lot of bad things.Now, with me, there's no lying. There's no nothing. They have nothing. They don't even have a crime. They say, This is the only one that's ever been impeached, and he didn't commit a crime. I didn't commit a crime. And then, you get into high crimes and misdemeanors. But I didn't commit a crime.So no, I have great respect for Ken.

First, I would like to just start out getting your general reaction today to the impeachment hearings on the Hill. Do you feel that Democrats made their case? And how did you feel about the Republican performance?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nAre you talking about the witch hunt? Is that what you mean? [] Is that what you're talking about? I hear it's a joke. I haven't watched. I haven't watched for 1 minute because I've been with the President, which is much more important, as far as I'm concerned. This is a sham and shouldn't be allowed. It was a situation that was caused by people that shouldn't have allowed it to happen.I want to find out who is the whistleblower, because the whistleblower gave a lot of very incorrect information, including my call with the President of Ukraine, which was a perfect call and highly appropriate. And he wrote something that was much different than the fact. I want to find out why the IG\u2014why would he have presented that, when, in fact, all he had to do was check the call itself and he would have seen it.I'm going to be releasing\u2014I think, on Thursday\u2014a second call, which actually was the first of the two. And you'll make a determination as to what you think there. But I've heard\u2014just a report\u2014they said it's all thirdhand information. Nothing direct at all. It can't be direct because I never said it.And all they have to do is look very, very simply at the transcript. If you read the transcript\u2014this was analyzed by great lawyers. This was analyzed by Gregg Jarrett. It was analyzed by Mark Levin. It was analyzed by everybody.

First, I would like to just start out getting your general reaction today to the impeachment hearings on the Hill. Do you feel that Democrats made their case? And how did you feel about the Republican performance?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nAre you talking about the witch hunt? Is that what you mean? [] Is that what you're talking about? I hear it's a joke. I haven't watched. I haven't watched for 1 minute because I've been with the President, which is much more important, as far as I'm concerned. This is a sham and shouldn't be allowed. It was a situation that was caused by people that shouldn't have allowed it to happen.I want to find out who is the whistleblower, because the whistleblower gave a lot of very incorrect information, including my call with the President of Ukraine, which was a perfect call and highly appropriate. And he wrote something that was much different than the fact. I want to find out why the IG\u2014why would he have presented that, when, in fact, all he had to do was check the call itself and he would have seen it.I'm going to be releasing\u2014I think, on Thursday\u2014a second call, which actually was the first of the two. And you'll make a determination as to what you think there. But I've heard\u2014just a report\u2014they said it's all thirdhand information. Nothing direct at all. It can't be direct because I never said it.And all they have to do is look very, very simply at the transcript. If you read the transcript\u2014this was analyzed by great lawyers. This was analyzed by Gregg Jarrett. It was analyzed by Mark Levin. It was analyzed by everybody. They said this statement that I made\u2014the whole call that I made with the President of Ukraine was a perfect one.So that this country gets put through that, that we have to waste this gentleman's time by even thinking about it, talking about it\u2014I'd much rather focus on peace in the Middle East. And I hear that it's a hoax, and it's being played as a hoax.

I'd be glad to.[The reporter continued in Turkish, and her question was translated by an interpreter as follows.]Mr. President, about FET\u00d6, we are not getting the best of news out of the United States. And the FET\u00d6 office targeting Turkey is extensively invested in their daily works, but I can see certain traces that the U.S. Government is ready to understand more about FET\u00d6.So my question is: How do you perceive the situation developing vis-a-vis the Fethullahist terrorist organization and the American approach to FET\u00d6 in that regard? Can we expect anything further?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes. Thank you. During this current visit, we are going to submit\u2014as we already have, actually\u2014a great deal of documents and evidence. And FET\u00d6 is a terrorist organization, and he is the leader, the ringleader of this terrorist organization. They have killed 251 people in Turkey. They tried to undertake a coup against the Government, the state. And more than 1,000\u2014more than 2,000 people have been injured. And the ringleader is living on an area of 400 acres in the United States, running his network all around the globe, and this is something unacceptable.And during this visit, as I've said before, we have introduced an additional array of documents. We will submit them to the relevant authorities, including Mr. President. And in the light of these documents, I think they will appreciate the situation. We send the terrorists back, if they ask for them, and I'm sure they will do the same for us.
