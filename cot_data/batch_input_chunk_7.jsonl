Why does that apply to Florida and it doesn't apply to mail-in balloting across the country?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nSo Florida has got a great Republican Governor, and it had a great Republican Governor. It's got Ron DeSantis, Rick Scott\u2014two great Governors. And over a long period of time, they've been able to get the absentee ballots done extremely professionally. Florida is different from other States.I mean, in Nevada, where you have a Governor\u2014he said, Let's just send out millions of ballots, and the Post Office cannot be prepared; I haven't spoken to the Post Office about it, but I don't know how they could possibly be prepared. Florida has been working on this for years. And they have a very good system of mail-in\u2014and that would be absentee or even beyond absentee. So, in the case of Florida, there aren't too many people that would qualify.They're so well run. Florida is a very well-run State: low taxes, low everything. They've done a great job, really a great job. And the two Governors, between the both of them, they've really got a great system of absentee ballots and even the\u2014even in the case of mail-in ballots, the postal services have built up their\u2014you know, it takes a long time.When you look at the Carolyn Maloney election, I think they\u2014and I'll give you the story: I think you have to do that election over. That election is no good. You have to take a look.In New York, they have thousands of ballots. They don't know what happened to them. Is there fraud? Is there\u2014it's a disaster. And that's only for a relatively small number of ballots. But I think they have to do the election in New York over.The Times wrote a big story about it yesterday, front page story. It's a disaster. It's a mess. And they have to do that\u2014I think they have to do that election over. Nobody can know what the election result is.So, in the case of Florida, they've done a great job, and they've had tremendous success with it. But they've been doing this over many years, and they've made it really terrific. So, for Florida, you can mail in your ballots. You don't have to go. In maybe a couple of other States, they've worked out a system, but this took years to do. This doesn't take weeks or months.In the case of Nevada, they're going to be voting in a matter of weeks. And you can't do that. I can't imagine the Post Office could do it. All of sudden, they're supposed to be dealing in millions of ballots?But Florida has done a great job, and we have total confidence that if you mail in your ballot in Florida, it's going to matter.Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhy does that apply to Florida and it doesn't apply to mail-in balloting across the country?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Separately, in New York today, the city prosecutor, sort of, confirmed a criminal investigation into the Trump Organization. Do you have any reaction to that? The President. Well, I just heard about it. This is just a continuation of the witch hunt. It's Democrat stuff. They failed with Mueller. They failed with everything. They failed with Congress. They failed at every stage of the game.This has been going on for 3\u00bd, 4 years. Even before I got in, this was starting with the Mueller deal. Mueller started a little bit after, but it started with some of the people that you know very well, the names\u2014Strzok and Page and all of the different people\u2014Comey.This has been going on. This is a continuation of the worst witch hunt in American history, and there's nothing that I know even about it. You know, they had\u2014I had seen that today just a little while ago. And I said, What's this all about? I know nothing about it. But it's just a continuation of the witch hunt. It didn't work out for Congress, didn't work out for Mueller, didn't work out for anybody. So what they're doing is, they send them around to all over the country, I guess, maybe.But it's a terrible thing that they do. It's really a terrible thing. The witch hunt has gone on long enough.

If you really look\u2014if you take a look at what's going on, especially now with all these flareups in nations that they were talking about\u2014and don't forget: We're much bigger, other than India and China. China is having a massive flareup right now. India has a tremendous problem. Other countries have problems.And I notice that in the news, in the evening news, I never read about that. In any of the news, I don't read about the other countries. You're starting to see that other countries are having very big flareups, countries that thought they were over it. Like, we thought we might be over it in Florida, and then, all of a sudden, it comes back. They do come back.But I think we're doing very well. I told Dr. Birx I think we're doing very well. She was in my office a little while ago. She's a person I have a lot of respect for. I think Nancy Pelosi has treated her very badly\u2014very, very badly. Very nasty. And I'm just referring to the fact that I thought that, really, they should say the job we've done, whether it's on ventilators or testing\u2014we've tested now over 60 million people. No other country is even close to that. We've tested 60 million people with great\u2014in many cases, about 50 percent now rapid fire, meaning 5- to 15- to 20-minute test, where you get the result almost immediately.

Mr. President, you said today in a tweet that Dr. Birx was taking bait from Speaker Pelosi. What did you mean by that, considering that she was just describing the facts about the case of the pandemic right now across the country?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I think we're doing very well, and I think that we have done as well as any nation. If you really look\u2014if you take a look at what's going on, especially now with all these flareups in nations that they were talking about\u2014and don't forget: We're much bigger, other than India and China. China is having a massive flareup right now. India has a tremendous problem. Other countries have problems.And I notice that in the news, in the evening news, I never read about that. In any of the news, I don't read about the other countries. You're starting to see that other countries are having very big flareups, countries that thought they were over it. Like, we thought we might be over it in Florida, and then, all of a sudden, it comes back. They do come back.But I think we're doing very well. I told Dr. Birx I think we're doing very well. She was in my office a little while ago. She's a person I have a lot of respect for. I think Nancy Pelosi has treated her very badly\u2014very, very badly. Very nasty. And I'm just referring to the fact that I thought that, really, they should say the job we've done, whether it's on ventilators or testing\u2014we've tested now over 60 million people. No other country is even close to that. We've tested 60 million people with great\u2014in many cases, about 50 percent now rapid fire, meaning 5- to 15- to 20-minute test, where you get the result almost immediately. Nobody has anything like that. Nobody.

Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about the Justice Department sending Federal agents into cities like Chicago as part of Operation LeGend. How exactly do you envision these Federal forces working alongside local police departments to help stop violent crime?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes. It's not a mass send, but it's sending very talented people to help them with the drugs and the shootings and the guns and the things that are happening. It's not like sending in the National Guard and stopping it cold, which, as an example, a lot of progress has been made in Portland. But you know, frankly, sending in the National Guard like we did in Minneapolis, it stopped it cold. From the time we sent that National Guard, they walked down the street, it was over in Minneapolis. Now it may be starting up again.This is\u2014these are Democrat-run cities and States, and it hasn't been a pretty picture to watch. We will help Chicago. We'll help New York, if they request. They have to request the help, but we want to stop the drugs. We want to stop the guns. A lot of the Chicago is guns and\u2014but what it is, is drug related, gang related. Largely gang related.With ICE, we send out thousands of MS-13\u2014thousands and thousands of MS-13. We send them back or, in some cases, have to put them in prison. They're too violent. They're truly violent.So we're helping out. When you look at what's happening in Chicago and some other cities with the shootings and the killings, they need help. And we haven't met with resistance, I have to be honest with you. I think it's good that we haven't. But we're only looking to help them. We're only looking to help.OAN.

Are you considering, at any point, issuing an Executive order addressing mail-in ballots? And why do you think some people are pushing it so hard?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, there's never been a push like this for mail-in ballots. And if you look at the New York Congressional race, which is a disaster\u2014Carolyn\u2014it's been a total disaster. They have\u2014they're 6 weeks into it now. They have no clue what's going on. And, I mean, I think I can say right here and now, I think you have to rerun that race, because it's a mess.Nobody knows what's happening with the ballots and the lost ballots and the fraudulent ballots, I guess. I think you'd probably have to take the Carolyn Maloney race and run it over again. How can you do this? And this is a small race with literally thousands of people\u2014small thousands\u2014and it's all messed up.You look at Paterson, New Jersey, it's all messed up. Almost every one of these\u2014and these are small, easy to control. They should be able to do this easy.Now you're talking about, like, Nevada, where last\u20142 nights ago, they went out and in the darkness of night without people, without having any meetings of the public, without having anything, they approved a ridiculous\u2014you don't have to look at signatures. You don't have to approve anything. You can have double mailings. You can have all sorts of things. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. It's a disgrace. I mean, honestly, it's a disgrace.So it's a very good question. I mean, the mail-in ballots, if you look at just some of the small places, the small races\u2014congressional race in New York, it should be very easy. Normally, that would have been announced at 7 o'clock, and it would have been down to the wire and everybody would have loved it. If it was at all complex, it would have taken an extra 45 minutes or an hour, and they would have announced it a little bit later. They have no clue. This was about 6 weeks ago, and they have no clue what's going on.They've lost ballots. There's fraudulent ballots. It's\u2014how are you going to do that for an entire nation? They're using COVID to try and get the mail-in ballots.Now, absentee ballots are great. Absentee ballots, they have to request them. They go through a process. They get them. But the universal mail-in ballots have turned out to be a disaster.And what Nevada has been doing\u2014if you look, over the last few days, you have to look at what they've done. You can have two ballots, you can harvest\u2014it's harvesting, so you can take thousands of ballots, put them together and just dump them down on somebody's desk after a certain period of time.They have something where, if you vote, the vote can count up to 7 days later. Well, if the vote is going to count 7 days later, that means you\u2014you know, if it depends on the one State like Nevada, that would mean simply that you can't have\u2014supposing it's down to that one State\u2014it could be\u2014it's a great State. But supposing it's down to that one State, that means you have to wait 7 days.But they won't have it there. This is something that's so messed up. And by the way, I have to say, the Post Office, for many, many years, has been, you know, run in a fashion that hasn't been great. Great workers and everything, but they have old equipment\u2014very old equipment. And I don't think the Post Office is prepared for a thing like this. You'll have to ask the people at the Post Office. But how can the Post Office be expected to handle? They have regular mailing, and then now, on top of that, they have the internet, where you have Amazon and these companies doing, you know, all the buying\u2014instead of going to a department store, they go buy through mail. So you have massive numbers of purchases now going through the Post Office, purchases of items and gifts, and that's a tremendous strain on the Post Office. The Post Office loses a fortune, and it has been for many, many years, for decades.So now, on top of it, it has this, and the Amazons of the world and the others, they pay very, very little money. They lose money on every\u2014the Post Office loses money, which is ridiculous, on every package it delivers. But now, on top of that\u2014and I'm not just referring to Amazon, I'm talking about all of the competitors, if there is such a thing, to Amazon. There will be. But if there is such a thing.But now, on top of that, you'll have somebody like the Governor of Nevada come out with this massive plan, out of nowhere, to take millions of ballots and send them all over the place. You'll never know who won that State. It will get messed up just like New York and just like Paterson, New Jersey and just like many other places.In West Virginia, they indicted a postman for doing something very bad. You know that. And\u2014but there are many cases all over the country. If you look, you'll be able to find\u2014there's a list of them all over the country. And that has to do with universal mail-in.Again, absentee is great. It works. Like in Florida, they'll do absentee. It really works.

We'll probably file something tomorrow.I do want to say that we're going to be introducing a tremendous health care plan sometime prior\u2014hopefully, prior to the end of the month.

Are you going to launch an effort to try to delay the election? Or was that just a trial balloon this morning? The President. Well, what I want to explain to people, but it doesn't need much explanation\u2014I mean, you look at article after article: New York's Mail-Vote Disaster, Tens of thousands of mail ballots have been tossed out in this year's primaries. What will happen in November? It's a mess. This is done by Washington Post. Can you believe it? The Washington Post, of all papers. Fake news, but in this case, it's not fake, it's true.This is done by the Wall Street Journal. Here's another one, Vote-by-mail experiment reveals potential problems within postal voting system ahead in the November election. And you see what's happening with so many different places. They're doing even trial runs; they're a disaster.And I don't want to see an election\u2014you know, so many years, I've been watching elections. And they say the projected winner or the winner of the election\u2014I don't want to see that take place in a week after November 3 or a month or, frankly, with litigation and everything else that can happen, years. Years. Or you never even know who won the election.You're sending out hundreds of millions of universal, mail-in ballots\u2014hundreds of millions. Where are they going? Who are they being sent to? It's common sense; you don't have to know anything about politics. And the Democrats know this. The Democrats know this, Steve.So I want to see\u2014I want an election and a result much, much more than you. I think we're doing very well. We have the same fake polls, but we have real polls. We're doing very well.I just left Texas. And Biden came out against fracking. Well, that means Texas is going to be one of the most unemployed States in our country. That means Oklahoma, North Dakota, New Mexico are going to be a disaster. Ohio, Pennsylvania\u2014disaster. No fracking.I want to have the result of the election. I don't want to be waiting around for weeks and months. And literally, potentially\u2014if you really did it right\u2014years, because you'll never know.These ballots are missing. You saw Paterson, New Jersey. You saw many other instances. There's tremendous litigation on that right now.And that doesn't include absentee. Absentee is different. Absentee, you have to work and you have to send in for applications. You have to go through a whole procedure. Like, for instance, I'm an absentee voter because I can't be in Florida because I'm in Washington; I'm at the White House. So I'll be an absentee voter. We have a lot of absentee voters, and it works. So we're in favor of absentee, but it's much different than millions of people.In California, they're going to send out tens of millions of voting forms. Well, where are they going to go? You read where postmen are in big trouble now. You read where city councils are in big trouble now. Voter fraud, all over the ballots.So no, I want to get\u2014I want to be standing, hopefully, hand held high, big victory, because we're doing things with our country that I think nobody else could have done. Our country is\u2014despite this pandemic, which is devastating the rest of the world, by the way\u2014devastating.One of the articles that came out was, The World's COVID Resurgence. This is the Wall Street Journal editorial, the main editorial yesterday in the Wall Street Journal. I don't always agree with them. But they have The World's COVID Resurgence. Countries hailed as models to see\u2014and then they go, the virus returns at a level it's never\u2014they haven't even seen.We've been giving praise to certain countries, and the virus has now come to them like the first time. But it's a very interesting\u2014and it talks about many countries where everybody was holding them up and saying what a great job they did. Well, it's just one of those things. Didn't work out so well. So we want to have an election. I'd love to see voter ID, but this is the opposite of voter ID. The Democrats love it; the Republicans hate it. We all agree that absentee voting is good. Mail-in ballots will lead to the greatest fraud.You know, we talk about Russia, Russia, Russia for 2\u00bd years, and then they found nothing, and there was nothing. But they talk Russia, Russia, Russia. They talk China. They talk all of these countries. They say they get involved in our elections. This is easy. You can forge ballots. This is much easier for foreign countries.Go ahead, Steve. Q. But delaying the election is probably a nonstarter. I mean, wouldn't you agree with that?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI just feel\u2014I don't want a delay. I want to have the election. But I also don't want to have to wait for 3 months and then find out that the ballots are all missing and the election doesn't mean anything. That's what's going to happen, Steve. That's common sense, and everyone knows it. Smart people know it. Stupid people may not know it. And some people don't want to talk about it, but they know it.And no, we want to have an election where people actually go in and\u2014What's your name? My name is so-and-so. Boom, you sign the book, like I've been doing for years.It's very, very unfair to our country. If they do this, our country will be a laughingstock all over the world, because everyone knows it doesn't work.How many ballots is he sending in California, as an example? Twenty-eight million or some massive number? Other States are sending out millions and millions of ballots. Well, they've done it. They had experiments. They had news organizations experimenting.And look, read the story in the Washington Post about mail-in voting; it's a disaster. I'm very surprised to see that story, frankly, from them. The story is a disaster. So we're asking for a lot of trouble.And no, do I want to see a date change? No. But I don't want to see a crooked election. This election will be the most rigged election in history if that happens.John [John Roberts, Fox News].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nBut delaying the election is probably a nonstarter.

Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday DHS came to an agreement with the Governor of Oregon to remove Federal officers, and Oregon State troopers took over. Mayor Ted Wheeler was noticeably absent from that agreement. Are you confident, sir, that the State of Oregon will be able to quell the protests in Portland? And if the violence does continue, would you consider redeploying Federal troops?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nSo our people have done\u2014Homeland Security have done a fantastic job. They went to Oregon a little more than a week ago. The place was a mess. The city, Portland, was just a disaster. You see it, and a lot of people weren't reporting it right. They tried to pretend it was a protest, as opposed to anarchists and agitators. You understand what I'm saying. It's a mess.They went there a short while ago, and they saved a Federal courthouse that costs hundreds of millions of dollars. And they put a ring around the courthouse, and they saved it. But the group that's there is basically meant to save buildings, and they were very strong, very powerful. And they didn't come out too often out of this cocoon that they built in order to save these very expensive, valuable, and psychologically important buildings\u2014right?\u2014like courthouses.The Governor and the mayor, we've been dealing with them, and we think they don't know what they're doing, because this should not have been going on for 60 days. It's not our job unless, in case of emergency\u2014which I consider now to be an emergency\u2014it's not our job to go in and clean out the cities. That's supposed to be done by local law enforcement.Yesterday the Governor worked a deal where they'll do it; we'll stand by, they'll do it\u2014and that's good. That was very good, but she didn't report it that way. What she reported was totally different. She said, I think Trump wants to take over the country. It's crazy.So what happened is, our people are staying there to see whether or not they can do it today and tomorrow. And if they don't do it, we will send in the National Guard and we'll take care of it. And we're telling, right now, these protesters\u2014and many should be arrested, because these are professional agitators, these are professional anarchists; these are people that hate our country. We're telling them, right now, that we're coming in very soon, the National Guard. A lot of people. A lot of very tough people. And these are not people that just have to guard the courthouse and save it. These are people that are allowed to go forward and do what they have to do. And I think that makes the Governor's job and the mayor's job a lot easier. So they're working today and probably tomorrow to clean out this beehive of terrorists. And if they do it, I'm going to be very happy. And then, slowly, we can start to leave the city.

Nobody has ever seen this before. Various types of flu will hurt young people more than older people.But young people are almost immune.

On that note, Mr. President, last night, in tweets that were deleted by Twitter, you said that Dr. Fauci misled the country about hydroxychloroquine.

I was just\u2014you know, he was at the\u2014he was at the Task Force meeting a little while ago.I have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci. You know, it's sort of interesting\u2014we've listened to Dr. Fauci. I haven't always agreed with him, and it's, I think, pretty standard. That's okay. He did not want us to ban our\u2014this\u2014this\u2014put up the ban to China, when China was heavily infected\u2014very badly, Wuhan. He didn't want to do that, and I did. And other things. And he told me I was right, and he told me I saved tens of thousands of lives, which was generous, but it's\u2014you know, I think it's fact that I banned\u2014I did the ban on Europe. But I get along with him very well and I agree with a lot of what he's said.So\u2014you know, it's interesting: He's got a very good approval rating, and I like that. I\u2014it's good. Because remember, he's working for this administration. He's working with us, John. We could have gotten other people. We could have gotten somebody else. It didn't have to be Dr. Fauci. He's working with our administration. And, for the most part, we've done pretty much what he and others\u2014Dr. Birx and others, who are terrific\u2014recommended.And he's got this high approval rating, so why don't I have a high approval rating with respect\u2014and the administration, with respect to the virus? We should have a very high, because what we've done in terms of\u2014we're just reading off about the masks and the gowns and the ventilators and numbers that nobody has seen, and the testing at 55 million tests; we tested more than anybody in the world. I have a graph that I'd love to show you\u2014perhaps you've seen it\u2014where we're up here and the rest of the world is down at a level that's just a tiny fraction of what we've done, in terms of testing.So it sort of is curious: A man works for us\u2014with us, very closely, Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Birx also highly thought of. And yet they're highly thought of, but nobody likes me. It can only be my personality.

Can I just ask you also: DHS announced today that it is going to undertake a thorough review of the DACA program to decide whether to continue it, and if not, how to disband it. You had mentioned, after the Supreme Court ruling about DACA, that you were thinking about a path to citizenship for DACA recipients. Are you still thinking about that?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWe're going to work with a lot of people on DACA, and we're also working on an immigration bill, a merit-based system, which is what I've wanted for a long time.That decision was an interesting decision, because it gave the President, as a President, more power than many people thought the President had. So the President is now, which happens to be me, in a position where I can do an immigration bill and a health care bill and some other bills. And you've seen some of them come along.We're going to do tremendous\u2014we just signed it 3 days ago\u2014we're doing tremendous prescription drug price reductions. Tremendous. It could be over 50 percent\u2014whether it's favored nations clauses or anything else. I mean, it's tremendous numbers we're talking about.You know, you go to some countries, and they'll sell, like, a pill for 10 cents, and in the United States, it costs $2. And it's the same basic factory. It's the same everything. The United States bears the cost of all of these low prices that you see all over the world where people go to Canada to buy a prescription drug from the United States. Not going to happen with me.

By the end of this year, we're going to\u2014in terms of the vaccine. I think in terms of therapeutics, even sooner than that. Therapeutics, meaning, you go, and you give somebody, whether it's transfusion or shots or whatever it may be, and they heal, and they heal quickly.So we've had tremendous progress. We already have, if you look at remdesivir and if you look at some of the other things. But we'll have some announcements on that over the next 2 weeks.Yes, it is hope, but it's only hope, because we've gotten such incredible results, scientifically.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhen is the soonest you expect a vaccine to be ready for Americans to take?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, Mr. President. Larry Kudlow, earlier today, said that the V-shaped recovery is showing signs of moderating. Do you think, given what we're seeing with the increase in cases, that the recovery could be in jeopardy at all, the economic recovery?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI don't think so. I think the recovery has been very strong. We've set record job numbers. We've set record numbers. Whether it's a pure V or a little bit less than that, I think it's going to be very good.If, therapeutically, we come up with some answers very quickly, which I think we will, then you're going to have a tremendous recovery. Likewise, with the vaccines, if you do that by the end of the year, that's ahead of schedule\u2014substantially ahead of schedule. And it's ahead of anything that's ever taken place, in terms of vaccines, before.So I think if those things happen\u2014if just one of those events happen, you'll go right back into that V, and I think you're probably in the V anyway.I really do believe a lot of the Governors should be opening up States that they're not opening, and we'll see what happens with them. But a lot will have to do with the fact that, therapeutically, I think you're going to have some great answers, vaccine-wise, likewise.Yes, please.

Mr. President, your poll numbers suffered in recent months because of your handling on the pandemic. You're here now today. What's your plan, going forward, to prove to Americans that you're the right person for this job?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI think the poll numbers are very good. The poll numbers we have are very good. We're leading in North Carolina. We're leading in Pennsylvania. We're leading in Arizona\u2014our numbers. We're leading in Arizona. We're leading nicely in Florida. I think our poll numbers are very good. We're leading substantially in Georgia. I mean, we get a lot of suppression polls. We get a lot of fake polls, just like we have fake news. I mean, it's a terrible thing when you look at it.But I had the same thing 4 years ago. I was losing everywhere. I had poll numbers where I wasn't going to win any State, and I ended up winning every one of them, you know, the swing States. I wasn't going to win any of them, and I won all of them. And I have the same thing this year. This year, they have it even closer. They have it closer, but it's the same suppression-type polls. We have polls that show me leading in almost every swing State and substantially in other States, by even more than I won in '16.When you look at Florida, as an example, you have thousands of boat out on\u2014boats out in the ocean, out in the Intracoastal. You look at other States where, likewise, you have thousands of boats, and they're all waving the Trump sign\u2014Trump-Pence sign\u2014and they're so proud. Thousands and thousands. You've seen it\u2014where you have Bikers for Trump with lines that are miles long on highways going along on weekends.I think there's more spirit now than there's ever been for my campaign, and that includes 2016, where obviously, there was great enthusiasm, great spirit. We had great spirit. I think there's more today, because what we've done, nobody has ever done before. Nobody has ever rebuilt the military, cut taxes\u2014the most in our history\u2014created the greatest economy we've ever had, cut regulations at a level that nobody has ever done, and all of these different things.The VA\u2014we got VA Choice. We got VA everything for the VA. Right now they had a 91-percent approval rating at\u2014in a recent poll. I was just speaking to the Secretary\u201491 percent in the VA. That's never happened before.I think when people see all that we've done, even Space Force. We created a force, an actual\u2014you know, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. Right? It's pretty amazing. Coast Guard. And now Space Force. That hasn't happened in 75 years. What we've done\u2014working with some of those warriors over there, by the way\u2014but what we've done has never been done.If you look at Alaska with ANWR, one of the\u2014perhaps the biggest drilling site in the world. Even Ronald Reagan and Bush and Clinton\u2014everybody wanted to get it done; I got it done\u2014ANWR in Alaska. Probably or possibly the biggest drilling site in the world. No, what we've done has been incredible.Recently, it looked like the energy business was going to be a catastrophe. We were number one in the world, and then we had the pandemic, and nobody was using energy. Nobody was driving in automobiles, no gasoline. And by the way, gasoline prices for everyone are very, very low, in many cases, less than $2. That's pretty incredible.And I saved the energy business. I got Russia and I got Saudi Arabia on the phone, and they cut way back. And we're now at $40-and-plus a barrel. And we're saving tens of millions of jobs in energy. We're the number-one in energy in the world.So with all that we've done, we made and brought this country to the greatest point in its history. We never had an economy like we had prior to the China plague or China virus coming in. We never had numbers like it. We are going to have them again. And everyone knows I'm going to rebuild it. I had to close it up. We saved millions of lives by closing it. If we didn't close it, you would have seen numbers that would have been 15 times what you have right now. One death is too much, but it would have been 10 to 15 times, maybe more, than that\u2014what you have.We closed this greatest economy ever\u2014far bigger than China, better than China. China was having, by the way, the worst year they had in 67 years. Tariffs\u2014they paid us tens of billions of dollars. The worst year they've had\u2014think of it\u2014in 67 years. We were having the best year we've ever had. I had to close it, and now we're reopening it. And next year, we'll be stronger. It will be the strongest year so far. It will be better, even than last year.Okay, thank you very much. I'll be heading back, and I'll see you back at the White House. Thank you very much. We're going to take an additional tour of the facility with your great leaders.Thank you very much to the people of North Carolina. We love being here. Thank you.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat's your plan, going forward, to prove to Americans that you're the right person for this job?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

On the convention, were you simply not convinced that you could keep people safe at the convention?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI just felt it was wrong, Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters], to have people going to what turned out to be a hotspot. You know, when we chose it, it was not at all hot; it was free. And all of a sudden, it happened quickly. It happens quickly. And it goes away, and it goes away quickly. The key is, we want it to go away without a lot of death, without a lot of problems.And we're learning so much about the disease. That's why we're very cognizant of nursing homes\u2014we're watching them very carefully\u2014and people over a certain age, and especially people over a certain age with diabetes or heart disease, in particular\u2014but with a problem.So we didn't want to take any chances. So we had a lot of people. We have\u2014the delegates want to be there. We're going to do a fairly reasonably quick meeting in North Carolina. The nomination will be produced. And then, we'll announce what we're doing, how we're doing it, whether it's something that's done online; I guess you could call it online. So there can nothing\u2014there can be nothing like our last convention, unfortunately. That was a great convention and in a great place, as you know. We had a great time\u2014a great time\u2014in Cleveland.But it's a different world, and it will be for a little while. We want to get the world back to what it was, and I think we'll have that, including great job numbers, including so many things that are happening so positive.I have to say, the stock market is close to records. For NASDAQ, it is a record. It's already exceeded its highest numbers. But we want to get our country back to what it was.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWere you simply not convinced that you could keep people safe at the convention?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

But we had the best numbers in history for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, every group you want to name: young people without a diploma, young people with a high school diploma, with a college diploma. Anything you want to name, we had the best numbers. Women doing incredibly. Never been a time like that.And we had to turn it off because of what China did. We had to turn it off. And then, all of the sudden, now we turn it back on, and we're doing very well. But it was very bad.China\u2014speaking about China\u2014the trade deal means less to me now than it did when I made it. When I made it, it was a great deal. But they're setting records. Yesterday was a record corn day. They purchased more corn than any order ever, and that went on for 2 or 3 days. And soy beans and all. But it just means much less to me. Can you understand that?

I think setting the example is very important. It's hard for us to say we're going to have a lot of people packed in a room, and then other people shouldn't do it.Don't forget, we're talking about schools. And we want them to be vigilant. And we're saying, Open. And then, we're saying\u2014here you have a big room. But I also\u2014if you notice, I said, Where bars are crowded, where other things are crowded. Well, there's nothing more crowded than a convention. A convention\u2014I mean, you've seen them. And even though you try and keep people away from each other, it's just not that kind of a thing. They probably can't do that. It just doesn't work for them. So it's a very hard\u2014so I think we're setting an example by doing it. It's very important.Yes, John [John Roberts, Fox News].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo you think it's an acknowledgment of the severity of the situation in Florida?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Also, Mitch McConnell's office just put out a statement, a moment ago, about the phase four relief package, CARES II, saying, quote, it's tailored precisely for this phase of the crisis. Yet it does not include your payroll tax cut. So do you believe it's perfectly tailored?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes, I'd like to see a payroll tax cut. I think it's great for the workers. The Democrats would never have gone for it. They don't want it. They're not big into the workers, I guess. And based on that, I told them last night\u2014I told the Republicans, who have been working very hard on this, I'll tell you\u2014and they want what's right for the country\u2014and hopefully, the Democrats ultimately will.But I said, I think a payroll tax will be good, but you're not going to get it from the Democrats. We need their votes, as you know. It's not like\u2014you know, we have a majority, but it's not enough that we\u2014that's why I guess we have an election coming up. So you still need Democrat votes, and we're not going to get the Democrat votes on that.So I'd like to see it. I think it would be very good for the workers. But if we're not going to get their votes, I guess we have to go on to the next thing. A payroll tax cut would have been very good. And maybe something happens.Yes, please.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nThe statement does not include a payroll tax cut.

President Trump, the Washington Post, earlier today, reported that one thing holding up the GOP coronavirus bill is the White House asking that it include language regarding the FBI building in downtown Washington, DC. Is that true?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI don't know that they're putting it in this bill, but I know they want to have a new FBI building. This one is very old, and it's really\u2014it was never built to a very high standard, as you probably have heard. And it's got a lot of danger involved and panels falling off the outside and pieces of concrete falling off the building.And they want to build it at the site that they have it. They had options very far away from Washington. And I said to him, Frankly, you have to be near the Justice Department. There's nothing better than the site. The site they have now is better. But they were looking in sites in Maryland and Virginia, in different places, but they would have been too far away.So I am\u2014I've been encouraging them to build it. And if you're going to\u2014you have a choice: You can renovate the existing building\u2014but it's not a good building\u2014or you could take it down and build a great building for the FBI for a hundred years and have it be incredible. Even with tracks on top, they're talking about\u2014you know, we have\u2014because FBI people like to work out a lot. And you could have, literally, quarter-mile tracks on top. It's a very big site, a very wide site.So I think the idea\u2014the best idea would be to build a new building. And that way, you have it for a long time. Renovation can never be as good as a new building, in that case. I know they're talking about it, whether or not they put it in this bill or someplace else. But the FBI needs a new building, and we'll get it done.Thank you all very much. Thank you.

Just to follow up on that, sir, real quick? The President. Go ahead, Jon.School Reopening Efforts/National Economy/Coronavirus Transmission Among Children  Q. Mr. President, do you plan to do a national strategy to help schools reopen and reopen safely? And regarding the children in your family\u2014your son, your grandchildren\u2014are you comfortable\u2014do you plan to have them back in person, in school this fall?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes. Well, I am comfortable with that. And we do have a national strategy, but, as you know, ultimately, it's up to the Governors of the States. I think most Governors, many Governors want these schools to open. I would like to see the schools open, especially when you see statistics like this. We have great statistics on young people and on safety. So we would like to see schools open. We want to see the economy open.We just had a report, literally as I walked in, that we set an alltime record on housing price increases, up, I think they said, 21 percent, which is a record. It's never happened before. That's a great sign. We have an economy that's going to be booming. It's going to be\u2014a lot of jobs are being produced. The job numbers will be coming out shortly\u2014meaning over the next week or so\u2014and I think it will be a continuation of the last 2 months. The last 2 months have been incredible.So I think we're going to have a great economy. You're going to have a fantastic next year. I think you're going to have a very good third quarter, actually, when the third quarter numbers come out. Interestingly, they'll be announced just before the election. They'll be announced around November 1.So yes, I would like to see the schools open, open a hundred percent. And we'll do it safely; we'll do it carefully. But when you look at the statistics I just read, having to do with children and\u2014and safety, they're very impressive. They have very strong immune systems.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo you plan to do a national strategy to help schools reopen and reopen safely?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Just to follow up on that, sir, real quick? The President. Go ahead, Jon.School Reopening Efforts/National Economy/Coronavirus Transmission Among Children  Q. Mr. President, do you plan to do a national strategy to help schools reopen and reopen safely? And regarding the children in your family\u2014your son, your grandchildren\u2014are you comfortable\u2014do you plan to have them back in person, in school this fall?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes. Well, I am comfortable with that. And we do have a national strategy, but, as you know, ultimately, it's up to the Governors of the States. I think most Governors, many Governors want these schools to open. I would like to see the schools open, especially when you see statistics like this. We have great statistics on young people and on safety. So we would like to see schools open. We want to see the economy open.We just had a report, literally as I walked in, that we set an alltime record on housing price increases, up, I think they said, 21 percent, which is a record. It's never happened before. That's a great sign. We have an economy that's going to be booming. It's going to be\u2014a lot of jobs are being produced. The job numbers will be coming out shortly\u2014meaning over the next week or so\u2014and I think it will be a continuation of the last 2 months. The last 2 months have been incredible.So I think we're going to have a great economy. You're going to have a fantastic next year. I think you're going to have a very good third quarter, actually, when the third quarter numbers come out. Interestingly, they'll be announced just before the election. They'll be announced around November 1.So yes, I would like to see the schools open, open a hundred percent. And we'll do it safely; we'll do it carefully. But when you look at the statistics I just read, having to do with children and\u2014and safety, they're very impressive. They have very strong immune systems.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo you plan to have your son and grandchildren back in person, in school this fall?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Do you want the American people to judge you on the ballot in November by how you've handled this pandemic so far?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThis, among other things. I think the American people will judge us on this, but they'll judge us on the economy that I created and that already we're creating. We're setting record job numbers, as you know. I think we're going to have a very strong year next year. I think we're going to have a very strong third quarter, a very good fourth quarter. But I think next year is going to be a record year, and I think they're going to judge me on that.I think they're going to judge me on the tax cutting and the regulation cutting, which nobody has ever done to the extent that we've been able to do it.On rebuilding the military, on how we've handled the VA: On the VA, we got Veterans Choice. Nobody thought that would be possible. That's been many decades. They've been trying to get Veterans Choice. It's called Choice, where they can go get a doctor if they have to wait on line for 2 weeks or 5 weeks or 2 days. And frankly, that's been a great thing. And Veterans Accountability, I think they'll judge me on that. They'll judge me on all of the things we've done.I don't think\u2014and I think we can say this with surety, and it's never ever been even challenged. In 3\u00bd years, the first 3\u00bd years\u2014the first years of a Presidency\u2014I don't think any administration, any President has accomplished so much as we've accomplished, from energy to health to so many other things.And then, this came in, and the plague\u2014I call it the plague\u2014the plague came in, a terrible thing. Should have been stopped. Wasn't stopped. It came in. We had to shut things down to save potentially millions of lives. We did that, and now we've started them up. And I think we've really started it up very successfully.Yes, please.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo you want the American people to judge you on the ballot in November by how you've handled this pandemic so far?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

You've been saying for months the virus would simply disappear, and now you're saying that it's likely to get worse before it gets better.

I think that\u2014I always like to say, as\u2014you know, either way, when you look at it, the Governors are working with me. I'm working with the Governor. We're working hand in hand. I think we're all responsible. I view it as a team. Very good relationships with the Governors. Very, very good relationships.I could say I'm fully responsible. But you know, one day, we had a virus come in, and I closed the borders, did a lot of things that were very good. In fact, Dr. Fauci said we saved tens of thousands of lives when I closed the border. And nobody wanted to do it. I wanted to do it. We closed the border to China. We put on the ban. We didn't want people coming in from heavily infected China.Fairly shortly thereafter, I closed the borders from Europe\u2014coming in from Europe. Those were tremendous moves. We would have\u2014if it's one person, it's too much. But we're at, let's say, 140,000; we could have double, triple, quadruple that number if we didn't.So we did a lot of things right. We did a lot of things right, including with equipment. So it's a shame that it happened. It shouldn't have happened.

Sir, you just spent the better part of an hour explaining why American should choose you and not your opponent. Yesterday, you said on Twitter, Be careful what you wish for! I guess the question is: Do you see yourself as the underdog in this race? Do you see yourself losing in the fall?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNo, I don't. I think we have a really good poll numbers. They're not suppression polls; they're real polls. You look at the Intracostal in Florida. You look at the lakes. You see thousands of boats with Trump signs, American signs. You've got the Trump-Pence sign all over. You look at what's going on. You look at bikers, for miles and miles, riding up highways proudly with their signs.I have\u2014look, we won a race where it was the same thing: 2016. We had polls that were fake. They turned out to be fake. Not all\u2014a couple of them got it right. Three of them, to be exact. Three of them. One of them was unsuspecting, but they got it right. They were very proud of it.But we had, in 2016, something even more so, but we got in, and we had 306 to, I guess, 223, which was a tremendous margin of difference. You remember, they all said, He cannot get to 270.I went to Maine a number of times, where we just freed up lobster fishing and fishing. Just\u2014they took away 5,000 square miles from Maine. I just opened it up. And I just got rid of tariffs in China. And we're working on European Union, which charge our fishermen tariffs. And I said, You're not going to do that. So we freed it up for Maine.But if you take a look, we went up there recently. There were crowds. Thousands of people lined up going over to a factory where we were opening up for\u2014we're making swabs. A beautiful, big, new factory, making swabs.I think that the enthusiasm now is greater\u2014and maybe far greater\u2014than it was in 2016. I think a lot of people don't want to talk about it. I think they're not going to say: Hey, I'm for Trump. I'm for Trump. They don't want to go through the process. And I fully understand that, because the process is not fair. The media doesn't treat us fairly. They never have, and perhaps they never will. But maybe they will when we turn this around for a second time. And it's going to happen very quickly. When we turn it around for a second time, maybe they will.I think we're doing very well in the polls. And I think you have a silent majority the likes of which this country has never seen before. This is a very important election. We've done a great job. We had to turn it off, as I said. Turn it off. And now we've started it again.As you know, they announced 2 weeks ago, record job numbers: almost 5 million people. And that beat the last month, which was also a record: 2.8 million people. Nobody's ever done what we've done, and now we're doing it twice.And I think by election day, you're going to see some incredible numbers. The third quarter is going to be really good. Fourth quarter is going to be great. But next year is going to be one of the best economic years.

I'm very worried about mail-in voting, because I think it's subject to tremendous fraud and being rigged. You see that Paterson, New Jersey, where\u2014I believe it was 20 percent of the vote was fraudulent. It was\u2014all sorts of things happened. I understand a mailman was recently indicted someplace for playing games with the mail-in ballots.You'll have tremendous fraud if you do these mail-in ballots. Now, absentee ballots are okay, because absentee ballots\u2014you have to get applications. You have to go through a process. If I'm here and I vote in Florida, you get an absentee ballot, but you have to go through a process. Absentee ballots are great.But mail-in voting\u2014where a Governor mails millions of ballots to people all over the State\u2014California\u2014millions and millions of ballots, as an example\u2014and then they come back; they don't come back. Who got them? Did you forget to send them to a Republican area or a Democrat area, I guess you could say?But if you take a look at all of the unbelievable fraud that's been involved with mail-in voting over the last\u2014even a short period of while\u2014but look at Paterson, New Jersey. It was a massive error and a massive miscalculation, and there was incredible fraud. Look at the city council, what's happened to it. This is one place, but you have many places, and they're all over.Yes, please.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\n[Inaudible]\u2014at this point?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

[Inaudible]\u2014letters, I mean, what actions can be taken to ensure that does not happen?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, you have a lot of actions we can take, including the\u2014including the increase. You know, right now people don't know: China is paying a lot of tariffs. We made a China deal, and they bought just\u2014I think the third highest amount of corn ever in our\u2014in world history. They just bought from us the highest amount, which is great for our farmers. But I view it differently than I did before I made the deal. When I made the deal, I thought this was a great deal. After what happened to us\u2014what happened to the world, coming from China\u2014I view it much differently. But we can impose massive tariffs on China if we want\u2014and other countries, if we want. And we'll see. We just want to be treated fairly. We want a level playing field. Our farmers were never treated properly by anybody, and they were targeted by China.You know, I paid our farmers $28 billion over a 2-year period because they were targeted to that amount of money\u2014to that exact amount of money: $28 [billion]*. It was $16 billion, and it was $12 billion\u2014$28 [billion]* over a 2-year period. And we gave $28 billion to our farmers. That's why they're all here.And now they're doing very well. Our farmers are doing very well because we made really great trade deals. USMCA just kicked in. The China deal, they're buying a lot. They are buying a lot. I will say that: They're buying a lot. A lot of people ask, How are they doing on the trade deal? They're buying a lot.So I want to thank everybody, and we'll be having these conferences again.I\u2014we're going to be signing an immigration act very soon; it's going to be based on merit. It's going to be very strong. We're going to work on DACA because we want to make people happy. And I'll tell you, even conservative Republicans want to see something happen with DACA.The Democrats had their chance for 3 years to do something with DACA, and they always turned it down. They always turned it down. They used it as politics. I'm using it to get something done.But we'll be signing a very powerful immigration act. It will be great. It will be merit-based. The country has tried to get it for 25 or 30 years. It will be strong on the border, but you'll come in legally, and you'll be able to come in legally.And very importantly, we'll be taking care of people from DACA in a very Republican way. A Republicans\u2014I've spoken to many Republicans, and some would like to leave it out, but, really, they understand that it's the right thing to do.So we're going to be taking care of DACA. We will be doing for DACA what the Democrats had a chance to do and they never did it.

Are you worried about the signal that it would send to Russia by doing this?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI think it sends a very strong signal to Russia. But I think a stronger signal sent to Russia is the fact that Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars to purchase energy from Russia, and\u2014through the pipeline. And I'm saying, What's that all about? You're spending billions of dollars to Russia, then we're supposed to defend you from Russia.So I think it's a very bad\u2014I think the people of Germany are very unhappy about it. I have many friends from Germany, and the people in Germany are very unhappy about it. They don't like it, but that's what they chose to do. So they're spending billions of dollars to buy Russian energy, and then we're supposed to defend them from Russia. So that doesn't work too well.But Poland has been very, very terrific. In fact, I don't believe Poland is actually accepting any of the energy from the pipeline from Russia. So that sends a signal right there.With all of that being said, we expect to get along with Russia; we expect to get along with everybody. But Germany has\u2014they really owe a lot of money in NATO, and this has been going on for many years. When you add it all up, you're probably getting close to a trillion dollars. And that's not treating NATO fairly, but it really isn't treating the United States fairly.You know, the United States is a very\u2014is the major participant in NATO. We pay more than anybody else, by far; have for many, many years. So we defend Europe, but Europe also takes tremendous advantage of the United States on trade, advantage like you wouldn't believe. So we're trying to work that out.And I would imagine they'd like to wait until after the election so that maybe they could deal with somebody other than But after the election, they'll just have to pay more, but that's the way it is. Okay?Thank you very much. Please. Sir, first of all, I do respect very much both Mr. President, Donald Trump, and the United States of America\u2014a wonderful, great state which today is the largest military and economic superpower in the world.And I wouldn't dare say to the President of the United States of America where he should send his soldiers, because this is the decision which is always taken by the United States. This is a very responsible decision.However, I do not deny that I requested Mr. President that he would not withdraw U.S. forces from Europe, because the security of Europe is very important to me, from Europe as such. I'm talking about the united Europe for which the American presence, since the end of the Second World War, is a huge security guarantee.However, if I'm asked by anybody if I am ready that Poland receives more U.S. troops in our country, of course, I am ready. In 2014, Russia attacked Ukraine. It annexed Crimea. It occupies Luhansk and Donetsk. Before that, it had attacked Georgia. 2014 was a year of huge fears\u2014huge fears in the Baltic States and very big ones, very considerable ones among the Polish society.Today, the presence of NATO troops and, first and foremost, of U.S. troops in Poland demonstrates that article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is treated seriously. And it shows that if anyone wanted to attack Poland, it won't be a soft landing for that entity; that it won't pay off for such an aggressor, because the strongest army of the world is present and they would help Polish soldiers to defend our borders if such a case arises.One hundred years ago, we repelled Russians from Warsaw. In a great battle in 1920, we defeated the Soviet Army Bolsheviks, and we drove them back to the east. That was a great victory, but we managed to stop them only very near to Warsaw, at the outskirts of our capital city. We would never want to see that situation repeated again. That is why the Allied presence is crucially important to us today and it is a very important security guarantee to us.So I'm very pleased that both within NATO, as well as in the United States, and today, that President of the United States understands the history of Europe and he understands the realities in Europe, and that he also understands the situation as it is developing in Europe.So today, this generates peace to my country; it brings security. And thanks to that, Russian\u2014unfortunately, the very strong imperial ambitions which have been revived over the last tens of years, I can say, because Georgia was attacked in 2008\u2014thanks to this, those ambitions have been stopped for the time being, at least in this part of the world. And I have no doubt whatsoever that this is also a huge merit of the policy of the United States. I'm grateful for that, just like all my compatriots are. Thank you very much. I just want to add: 2014, which the President was talking about, that was a year where Russia had a good time with the United States. To the best of my knowledge, President Obama and Sleepy Joe Biden, they were in power. They were the ones that were doing it. This was before us. It hasn't happened with us, and it won't happen with us either.Please, go ahead.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAre you worried about the signal that it would send to Russia by doing this?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

And we had one. Basically, we had one person. So\u2014and we had a lot of people that work here. This building is shocking, if you looked at the numbers. And it's also tremendous numbers of people coming in. Normally, you wouldn't do that. But because we're running a country, we want to keep our country running. So we have a lot of people coming in and out. Many of those people\u2014most of those people are tested depending on what portion of the Oval Office area they're going in. Everybody coming into the President's office gets tested. And I've felt no vulnerability whatsoever, John.But the two people, as I said, and three people, are\u2014they have been tested, and it's negative, and be probably out of quarantine very quickly.

Mr. President, if I can follow up on that: Your staff, your senior staff, as you just referenced, is able to get tested every day. When will it be that Americans across the country will be able to get tested every day, as they go back to work?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nVery soon. I mean, really, very soon. It's an interesting question, because normally, you would have said that you are not tested, and you would have been, you know, knocking us for not getting tested. So, if we get tested, it's a problem. And if we don't get tested, it's a problem.But I like the way your question was phrased better this way, because it is a positive. We are tested; we have great capability. You look at all of these machines here. They're incredible machines. They're the best anywhere in the world. No place in the world has this kind of equipment. Other countries are calling\u2014sophisticated countries\u2014and they're calling. Lots of countries. And we're trying to make as much as we can available to them, because there's nothing like what we've been able to do in a\u2014literally a couple of months.What they've been able to do\u2014the private sector, what they\u2014how they got it done. This is a 5- to 15-minute test, as an example\u2014the Abbott Laboratories test. These tests are highly sophisticated\u2014very quick, very good. This is things that didn't even exist a short while ago.So we do have a great testing capability at the White House. We're doing it. And I think, generally speaking\u2014we had a call with the Governors the other day\u2014generally speaking, without exception, they were all extremely happy with what's going on, with respect to their testing.

We'll see what happens. But as I said, it's a transition, and it's a\u2014this is really going to be, in my opinion\u2014we'll see, but I think it's going to be something that's going to be very special. It's a transition to greatness, and greatness is next year, right from the beginning. I think we're going to do fantastically well.I view the third quarter, as I said, as a transition quarter. It could be pretty good, but a transition quarter. Toward the end of the fourth quarter, you're going to see some numbers that are going to be tremendous, I think. And next year, you're going to have potentially the kind of numbers that you saw before, and maybe even better, because there is that pent-up demand that is\u2014you know, a lot of people wanted to do things. They were ready to do things, and they've had to hold back because of the virus.So I think you're going to have, with that pent-up demand, a phenomenal year next year, unless somebody messes it up by coming along and raising taxes\u2014doubling, tripling, quadrupling your taxes. Like a certain party, namely the Democrats want to do. You'll mess it all up.You know, we had the greatest in the world. I presided\u2014this administration presided\u2014over it.
