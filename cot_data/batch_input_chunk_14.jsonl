They're getting a lot of good things. Mexico made a very good deal.But with Canada, it's very tough. What we're doing is if we made a deal with Canada\u2014which is a, you know, a good chance still.

Touching back on Iran: Of course, this week, you've put out a call to action to other countries to rally with America, to put pressure on Iran. Rouhani is still calling for the U.S. to come back into the old deal. But after meeting with world leaders this week, did you make any progress towards a potential new deal?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nIt doesn't matter what world leaders think on Iran. Iran's going to come back to me and they're going to make a good deal, I think. Maybe not. Deals: you never know.But they're suffering greatly. They're having riots in every city, far greater than they were during the green period with President Obama. Far greater. When President Obama stuck up for government, not the people. You probably would have had a much different Iran had he not done that. But I'm sticking up for the people. I am with the people of Iran.But here's the thing: They have rampant inflation. Their money is worthless. Everything is going wrong. They have riots in the street. You can't buy bread. You can't do anything. It's a disaster. At some point, I think they're going to want to come back, and they're going to want to say, Hey, can we do something?And I'm very simple; I just don't want them to have nuclear weapons. That's all. Is that too much to ask? I don't want them to have nuclear weapons.I want them to have a great economy. I want them to sell so much oil so that the oil prices\u2014I'm not happy with OPEC. I told them, I'm not happy with OPEC. We take care of all these people; we defend them. They wouldn't be there for 2 weeks if it wasn't for me and the United States and a much stronger Armed Forces than it was. Because our Armed Forces was depleted. We had old equipment.Now, we have\u2014hey, you know better than anybody, $700 billion and $716 billion. We have the most incredible new jets and everything. We need it. Not that I want to spend it, although it is jobs. It's all made in the United States.But Iran has to come back, and they have to talk. And I'm not doing this from strength or weakness. I'm just saying, at some point, I think they're going to have to come back. If you look at what's going on, companies are leaving left and right. Mercedes-Benz just left. They're all leaving. They don't want to be in Iran. Because they have a choice: Do they want to be with Iran, or do they want to be with us?And we have, by\u2014we picked up $10 trillion since my election. We were being caught by . Now it's going the other way. People can't believe it. People have never seen this situation with . Everything's always been for 20 years: Oh, is so great. is so great. You don't hear that so much anymore. I love ; I think they're great. But you don't hear that so much anymore. You know who's great now? We're great now.Okay, how about just a couple of more.

And what was that experience like for you?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes. It was fake news. And it was covered that way. Okay. So I said that since my election our economy has become the hottest in the world. Tax reductions, regulations, confidence levels are the highest in 18 years\u2014really, soon to be historic. Unemployment is the lowest in the history of our country. You look at Black unemployment. You look at Asian unemployment. You look at women\u201465 years. The unemployment numbers are among the best we've ever had ever. The numbers of new companies pouring into our country, which nobody thought was possible.And I said this. And I was in front of a large group of highly professional people, most of whom are from either other countries or the United Nations, people that aren't big into clapping, applauding, smiling. And I heard a little rustle, as I said our country is now stronger than ever before. It's true. I mean, it is true. And I heard a little rustle. And I said, It's true. And I heard smiles. And I said, Oh, I didn't know there there'd be that kind . . . They weren't laughing at me. They were laughing with me. We had fun. That was not laughing at me.So the fake news said, People laughed at President Trump. They didn't laugh at me. People had a good time with me. We were doing it together. We had a good time. They respect what I've done.The United States is respected again. The United States was not respected. Everybody was taking advantage of us, from jobs, and taking our companies, and not paying the price\u2014to so many other things, even military protection. I told a number of countries over the last few days, I said: Listen, you're a very rich country. We protect you. Without our protection, you would have real problems.

Can you give us any more preview of what this great deal, the peace deal with Palestinians?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I'd love to be able to make a deal with the Israelis and the Palestinians. You know, my whole life, I was told that's the toughest deal. And I disagree. I think health care is probably tougher, okay? You want to know the truth. But it is tough. But we're going to take care of that, too. And that's going to get taken care of. We've already taken care of a lot of it. But the whole\u2014my life, I've always heard the deal between, as you know, Israel and the Palestinians, that's like the toughest deal. Every possible thing is tough about that. I think we're going to make a deal. I think we're going to make a deal.So, at one of our many meetings today, I was with Bibi Netanyahu, a man who I have a lot of respect for. A man who has been extremely nice to me\u2014very happy that I did the whole thing with Jerusalem and the Embassy, which, by the way, we're going to open in 4 months for less than $500,000. And the budget was over $1 billion, right?\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nCan you give us any more preview of what this great deal, the peace deal with Palestinians?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

So how can a guy who does that be your friend?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI think that we are able to\u2014and maybe he's not anymore. I'll be honest with you, I think we had a very good friendship. I think we had a very good relationship; we understand each other. They are doing studies on Donald Trump. They're trying to figure it all out, because this has never happened to them before. It's never happened.Think of it, you've never seen\u2014you've covered very well\u2014you've never seen this happen. They're having big problems. I don't want them to have problems, but they've got to make a fair deal. Just like Canada has got to make a fair deal.I believe that he and I have a very good chemistry together. And I can tell you that about many leaders. I can also tell you a few where I don't feel I'll ever have a chemistry with them. I don't want to have a chemistry with them. And for those people, I'll have Pompeo, Nikki, Bolton, Jared. I can go\u2014our General; I'll have our General. Or if they can't do it, I'll have Sarah Huckabee do it. Right?But for the most part, I have very good\u2014very good with Prime Minister Abe. Very good with President Moon. By the way, what President Moon said last night\u2014I know you won't report it\u2014but Bret Baier [Bret Baier, Fox News] interviewed him last night, and he asked him about me. I can't say\u2014because you would say I'm too braggadocious\u2014but what he said about me last night was an unbelievable thing. Couldn't have happened without President Trump, and it never would happen without President Trump. And nobody else could do it. You know, I mean, you'll take a look.But I will tell you, is very special. Very special. They're incredible people. It's an incredible country. What they've done is unbelievable.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow can a guy who does that be your friend?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

I just had two small follow-ups. One is, how would you compare the level of interference you see today from the Chinese to what Russia did in 2016?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I think it's different. If you look at the Des Moines Register, I mean, they have ads that are made to look like editorials. Saying about: Oh, you've got to stop Trump. You've got to stop him. You've got to vote against him. My farmers are so incredible. These are patriots.You know, on a network that doesn't like me very much, which is most of them\u2014but a network that didn't\u2014doesn't really treat me very good, they interviewed farmers. And they got hurt because, you know, all of a sudden stops buying.By the way, they've started buying again. I don't know if you've noticed. And soybeans are going up, and things are going up. And we've had very little hurt from what I've done. In fact, the markets have gone up. And the farmers are going to do great.But ultimately\u2014but they had farmers, and these guys are amazing; I love them. And they voted for me, and they love me. And they said: We don't care if we get hurt. He's doing the right thing. And you know, a lot of people\u2014it's a complex game. A lot of people don't know exactly what it is. They don't know how to define tariff. They don't know it is really different than a tax, although it's getting close.But they know that for the first time in many, many years, they have a President that's fighting for them; that's not letting their jobs be taken to other countries; that's not allowing the kind of abuse that we\u2014I mean, when you look at what happened, as an example, with NAFTA. And for years\u2014because it was never changed\u2014NAFTA was defective deal the day it was signed.You know why? Because they had a VAT tax of 17 percent and nobody from this country knew that. And by the time they found out, which was about a week later, nobody went and changed it. So you went many years, and they never changed it. There was a VAT tax that Mexico got. So we were 17 or 16 points behind, before we even started. NAFTA was a horrible thing.So the farmers and\u2014by the way, the steel workers\u2014you know, I stopped the dumping. The dumping was horrible. And now if they want to dump, that's okay, but they've got to pay the United States of America 25 percent on everything they dump. That's okay. But as I told you before, steel is doing phenomenally well.But the farmers say, This man is fighting for us. No President has ever fought for us before. And you really have to study what's happened over the 15 years with the farmers. The farmers have been decimated over a 15-year period. They've been decimated. The farmers are going to come out great. These are great people. They're great, great patriots.I think we should finish with that one. Is that okay?[.] . Okay. Go ahead. Let's go.

But as I told you before, steel is doing phenomenally well.But the farmers say, This man is fighting for us. No President has ever fought for us before. And you really have to study what's happened over the 15 years with the farmers. The farmers have been decimated over a 15-year period. They've been decimated. The farmers are going to come out great. These are great people. They're great, great patriots.I think we should finish with that one. Is that okay?[.] . Okay. Go ahead. Let's go.

So what message do you have for young men of America?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nIt's a very big\u2014it's also\u2014you're right. I think it's a great question.This is a very big moment for our country, because you have a man who is very outstanding, but he's got very strong charges against him\u2014probably charges that nobody is going to be able be\u2014to prove.So I could have you chosen for a position. I could have you or you or you\u2014anybody. And somebody could say things. And it's happened to me many times, where false statements are made. And honestly, nobody knows who to believe.I could pick another Supreme Court judge\u2014Justice. I could pick another one, another one, another one. This could go on forever. Somebody could come and say: Thirty years ago, twenty-five years ago, ten years ago, five years ago, he did a horrible thing to me. He did this. He did that. He did that.And honestly, it's a very dangerous period in our country. And it's being perpetrated by some very evil people. Some of them are Democrats, I must say. Because some of them know that this is just a game that they're playing. It's a con game. It's at the highest level. We're talking about the United States Supreme Court.This can go on forever. I can pick five other people. At a certain point, the people are going to say, No, thank you. This is the most coveted job, probably, in the world.And you know what? I would honestly say\u2014because I interviewed great people for this job. He's great, but I interviewed other great people for this job. I could conceivably imagine going to one of them and saying: It's too bad what happened to this wonderful man, but I'm going to choose you, number two. I want you to go. And I could conceivably be turned down by somebody that desperately wanted this job 2 months ago.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nMessage for young men of America\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, Mr. President. So news today of a plane\u2014a Russian plane\u2014shot down over Syria. Russia is assigning the blame to Israel, even though it was accidentally shot down by Syrian forces.Clearly, things are heating up. There's concerns by many Americans\u2014most Americans\u2014that we might be involved in a war in Syria soon. You had hoped to bring troops home, but clearly, things are changing. What do you tell American people today about a possibility of war in Syria?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I just heard about the incident you have mentioned, Emerald, and it sounds to me and it seems to me, just like based on a review of the facts, that Syria shot down a Russian plane. And I understand about 14 people were killed, at least. And that's a very sad thing. But that's what happens. But Syria\u2014according to early reports; that's subject to change\u2014but that Syria shot down a Russian plane. So that's not a good situation.We have done a tremendous job in Syria and in that region eradicating ISIS, which is why we're there. And we're very close to being finished with that job, and then we're going to make a determination as to what we're going to do. But we have eradicated ISIS in a very large area of the Middle East. These are people that will not be coming here, because they're not around any longer. So we've done in a very short period of time.Our Vice President is here, Mike Pence. Our great Secretary of State\u2014really, thank you very much for the great job you're doing\u2014Mike Pompeo. And we've been working very hard on this. And they've done an incredible job over there, but we'll make a decision fairly quickly.Thank you very much.

Thank you, President Duda. Clearly, you said you asked President Trump if he would consider a permanent base in Poland, and of course, that also relates to Russia. What would you say\u2014how did the President respond to your position to have a permanent base from America in Poland?And then, also, do you currently have concerns over the U.S.-Russia relationship?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, of course. Of course, I told Mr. President about all the aspects connected with the permanent presence of the U.S. Armed Forces in Poland. But, first and foremost, I assured Mr. President of one thing. First and foremost, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot say that, if there are permanent bases of the U.S. Armed Forces in Poland, we will see a deterioration of security because that will lead to an increase in Russian activity and increased militarization of this part of Europe by Russia.I want to say it clearly, ladies and gentlemen: A very strong militarization of, for instance, Kaliningrad Oblast has taken place for more than 10 years now. It is the reality that we're living today. As far aggressive Russian behavior is concerned, as far as increased military activities concerned, including increasing of the militarization, Russia has been conducting such activities in a systematic way. And for the first time, we were able to see that in a materialized way in Georgia. In 2008, when the then-President of Poland, Professor Lech Kaczynski, took other European leaders, and they went to Tbilisi to stop Russian tanks, which were about to attack the capital of Georgia. And from that moment, that military expansion has been developing.It's another leg was the attack on Ukraine. And today we can see an illegal annexation of Crimea. Today, we are witnessing constant violation of international law in the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. So these are today political and military facts of Europe, and the presence of the United States is only providing a guarantee of security and a possibility to defend.Because let me reiterate again: It is only about the guarantee of security and defense of our part of Europe that is the free world. This is the most crucial issue right now from our perspective, from the perspective of Central and Eastern European countries. And we are speaking in one voice on this one, generally.That is why we wanted to ensure the presence of the United States Armed Forces, and also, we wanted to have the presence of NATO forces in our part of Europe as well. And of course, Mr. President and his staff, his advisers, and also the Pentagon staff, have to consider all these issues, but there is a whole range of arguments which are in favor of the fact that the presence of the U.S. Armed Forces in this area is absolutely justified today. That is due to the protection of the interests of the United States as well.So I'm absolutely convinced of this one, because today, unfortunately, we are seeing international law being violated. Today, we are seeing aggressive behaviors, and I am convinced that there is no more effective method of preventing a war than a decisive stance demonstrating that we are ready any moment to repel a possible attack. And presence also means deterrence. At the same time, I am convinced that when we are\u2014when we have a strong military presence in this part of Europe where there is a potential threat, then there will be no war happening ever. And I think it should be pointed out that the President also said, and he also said it publicly, that he would pay the United States\u2014meaning Poland would be paying billions of dollars for a base. And we're looking at that more and more from the standpoint of defending really wealthy countries and not being reimbursed, paid.It's one thing when we defend countries that can't defend themselves and their great people. And we should help them; we don't expect anything for that. But when we're defending immensely wealthy countries and they're not paying for the defense to the United States, they're only taking advantage of us. And we are in discussions with numerous countries, all of whom you know, about payment. Payment. And we get along with them very well, but it's not fair. That includes NATO.As you know, I got $44 billion additional last year, where they paid an additional\u2014you can speak to Secretary General Stoltenberg, who is the head of NATO, and he said he's never seen anything like it. And this year we did even better.But when a country is very wealthy, and when the United States has been protecting them for many years at tremendous cost\u2014cost like nobody in this room would believe\u2014it's time that they help with, we call it burden-sharing. And they will do that.But the President offered us much more than $2 billion to do this, and so we're looking at it. We're looking at it from the standpoint of, number one, military protection for both countries, and also cost, a term you don't hear too often and you haven't heard too often over the last 25 years. But that's the way it has to be.Thank you very much.

[Inaudible]\u2014Polish Press Agency. I've got a question to President Trump. Do you share the conviction, which we have just heard a minute ago expressed by President Duda, concerning the threat which is posed to the region, but not only to the region, by Russia? And do you also share the view that permanent American bases in Poland are justified not only due to the security of the countries in our region, but also due to the security of the United States?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI do. I actually do. I think it's a very aggressive situation. I think Russia has acted aggressively. They respect force. They respect strength, as anyone does. And we have the greatest strength in the world\u2014especially now. We were being depleted under the last administration. We had planes that were old and tired and didn't fly, in some cases. They were getting used parts. This is the United States; it doesn't happen. We make the greatest planes in the world and missiles in the world.And we have enhanced, to put it mildly, our military. It's literally being rebuilt, as we speak, with literally hundreds and hundreds of planes and missiles, and everything that you can imagine. They never had it so good, because I got, in Congress, $700 billion this year; $716 billion last year. That's far more than they ever anticipated.I viewed it two ways. Number one, military\u2014because it's always more important than anything else, including jobs. But number two is jobs. We make everything here. So it's hundreds of thousands of jobs to make for us the best military in the world. And Russia respects that. They respect that. So I am with the President. I feel that he's right. And I feel that, look, you look at the history of Poland and Russia, that's a long and very complicated history. So he certainly has a right to feel that way.

Do you share the conviction, which we have just heard a minute ago expressed by President Duda, concerning the threat which is posed to the region, but not only to the region, by Russia? And do you also share the view that permanent American bases in Poland are justified not only due to the security of the countries in our region, but also due to the security of the United States?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI do. I actually do. I think it's a very aggressive situation. I think Russia has acted aggressively. They respect force. They respect strength, as anyone does.

Would you support such a thing?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nIt wouldn't bother me, other than the FBI, Jon, said that they really don't do that; that's not what they do. Now, they have done, supposedly, six background checks over the years, as Judge Kavanaugh has gone beautifully up a ladder. He's an incredible individual. Great intellect, great judge. Impeccable history in every way\u2014in every way.I feel so badly for him that he's going through this, to be honest with you. I feel so badly for him. This is not a man that deserves this. This should have been brought to the fore. It should have been brought up long ago. And that's what you have hearings for. You don't wait until the hearing is over and then, all of a sudden, bring it up.When Senator Feinstein sat with Judge Kavanaugh for a long period of time\u2014a long, long meeting\u2014she had this letter. Why didn't she bring it up? Why didn't she bring it up then? Why didn't the Democrats bring it up then? Because they obstruct and because they resist. That's the name of their campaign against me. They just resist, and they just obstruct. And frankly, I think they're lousy on policy, and in many ways, they're lousy politicians. But they're very good on obstruction. And it's a shame, because this is a great gentleman.With all of that, I feel that the Republicans\u2014and I can speak for myself\u2014we should go through a process, because there shouldn't even be a little doubt. There shouldn't be a doubt. Again, they knew what they were doing. They should have done this a long time ago\u20143 months ago\u2014not now. But they did it now. So I don't want to play into their hands.Hopefully, the woman will come forward, state her case. He will state his case before representatives of the United States Senate. And then, they will vote. They will look at his career. They will look at what she had to say from 36 years ago. And we will see what happens.But I just think he is at a level that we rarely see not only in government, anywhere in life. And honestly, I feel terribly for him, for his wife, who is an incredible, lovely woman, and for his beautiful young daughters.

On trade, Mr. President, you announced new trade tariffs against China. Trade tariffs are a very important part of your economic and trade policy. In you first year in office, the U.S. trade deficit increased by 12 percent. And last month, we saw the trade deficit increase to, I believe it was, $72 billion. So my question to you is, is your trade tariffs policy working?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, we just started. We didn't do anything with respect to China because we wanted to have the benefit of China having to do with North Korea. And they have been helpful. I hope they're still helpful; there's a question about that. But it got to a point where the numbers were too big. This should have been done for the last 20 years.If you look at the WTO, the World Trade Organization, that's when China really happened, economically. That's\u2014it was like a rocket ship, because they took advantage of the rules of the WTO.And whoever was standing at this podium in this incredible White House, in the Oval Office, they should have done something about this long ago.Over the last number of years, China has taken out of this country $500 billion and more\u2014a year. $500 billion. That would go a long way for Poland, wouldn't it? You could rebuild your whole country. And that's what China did. They rebuilt their country with tremendous amounts of money pouring out of the United States. And I've changed that around. And if you look at what's going on, our market is going up like a rocket ship. I don't want their market to go down, but their market is down 32 percent in 3 months. Because we can't let them do anymore what they've done.And I watch trade deficits, because to me, deficits are very important. They're not everything, and they're not exact. Sometimes, you can have, you know, a deficit, and that's not such a bad thing. But when you have $375 billion in trade deficits and then many billions of dollars in other liabilities of all different types, you have to do something about it.We are the piggybank to the world. We have been ripped off by China. We've been ripped off by\u2014excuse me, Mr. President\u2014the European Union, of which you're a part of. [] We've been ripped off by everybody. And I want to protect the American worker, the American farmer, the ranchers, the companies. And we're not being ripped off, you will see, in a little while.Speaking of that, we've come to a conclusion with Mexico. We have a wonderful deal for both parties. It was a very one-sided deal. Now it's a good deal for both parties. Very happy with it.The new President had conversation and it was terrific. I think we're going to have a very good relationship. We'll see. We'll see. We want help on the border because we have the worst immigration laws in the history of mankind or womankind. We have horrible, horrible immigration laws, so we want help. But we've come to a conclusion with Mexico. Canada has taken advantage of our country for a long time. We love Canada. We love it. Love the people of Canada. But they are in a position that's not a good position for Canada. They cannot continue to charge us 300-percent tariff on dairy products, and that's what they're doing.So this is a process. It takes a little time. The European Union wouldn't talk to us. They wouldn't talk to President Obama. Wouldn't even talk to him. And then I said, That's okay, you don't have to talk to me. Jean-Claude is a tough man. He's a very good man. I like him, but he's tough. He's nasty. [] The kind of guy I want negotiating for me. But he's a tough, tough cookie. And I said to him, We have to renegotiate the deal. He said: But, Mr. President, we are very happy with the deal. We don't want to negotiate. I said, You may be happy with the deal, but I'm not happy with the deal.And he didn't want to renegotiate. And after three times, he still didn't want to renegotiate. I said, That's okay, we don't have to renegotiate any longer. We're going to put a tariff on all of the millions of cars you send into the United States. And honestly, he was in my office so quickly, from Europe, that I didn't know they had airplanes that flew that fast. [] I said, Where did you find this plane? []And we have the semblance of a deal. Because it's, to a large extent, economically all about cars. Cars are a very big factor. And they send millions of BMWs and Mercedes into our country.So we are working on trade very hard. It's very important to me. It has been for 30 years. I've been saying for 30 years. It started with Japan. I talked about Japan; I was right. I talked about China; I was right. It's what I do. And I like doing it. But I like doing it for the people because our country has been abused and taken advantage of by virtually every country that it does business with. And we're just not letting that happen anymore. And that includes what I said previously about the military.Please.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nIs your trade tariffs policy working?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

President Duda, welcome back to the U.S. As it relates to U.S.-EU relations, as the President mentioned, you are a proud\u2014Poland is a proud member of the European Union. How would you describe U.S.-EU relations right now? Did you talk about improving that relationship? Did you carry a special message to the President from Mr. Juncker?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nSir, I would be very happy if it was Poland which would disrupt the trade balance of the United States. I really would be happy if that was the case. Because my understanding, as far as politics is concerned, and carrying for the matters of your country is similar to the view of Mr. Mr. Trump is saying America first, and I'm saying, Poland first. So we understand each other very well.And it is hard for me to be surprised with the fact that Mr. President being a very experienced man\u2014a man of success, as far as business is concerned\u2014knows how to calculate. He knows how to calculate, and I think nobody puts that into question either in the U.S. or in another place. And he takes care of the United States. It lies in the interest of the country to have a balanced trade exchange, and this is something that you have to take care of. And of course, there is a clash of interest. However, objectively looking, it is hard not to understand it.So there is always competition of interest. There is\u2014every kind of business is a competition of interests. And I represent Polish interests, whereas President Trump represents American interests. The whole thing is as follows: On important matters, you have to strike an agreement to make sure that both countries wins and lose as little as possible. And then, we have an understanding, an agreement. And then, we can say that we are cooperating with each other on equal level. And I believe this is the kind of cooperation that Mr. President would like to have with the European Union. And it is\u2014it will be hard to be surprised with that.I'm listening kindly to that, and I would like Poland to be such a country, such an economic superpower, that it would be a very important partner to the United States. I said jokingly, in the beginning, that I wish it was Poland which disturbed the trade balance of the United States and our exports to the United States, but I do believe that our cooperation is going to develop well on partners, like principles. The trade deal with South Korea has been fully renegotiated and is ready for signature. We may sign it at the United Nations or shortly thereafter. That was a terrible deal for the United States. Now it's a fair deal. But that's been fully renegotiated, in addition to Mexico and some of the others that are very close.Thank you very much, everybody. We appreciate it. Thank you.

Or are you leaving some room for negotiation there?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI'll always leave room for negotiation. But this has been many years; this isn't just Trump administration. We're new. This has been many years, even decades. We have immigration laws. We have border security. We have all sorts of things going on that are\u2014it's disgraceful. We are doing a phenomenal job. We're setting records. But we have laws that don't work. So we're working around those laws, and it's unfortunate.I have to take my hat off to the Border Patrols, for the law enforcement, to ICE, which really has been maligned by the Democrats. The job they do, they go into these MS-13 nests, nests of bad, bad people, killers, in many cases. And they go in there fearless, and they do an incredible job. And they get them out. They either go to jail, or they get out of the country. So I want to just take my hat off to ICE and the brave people that have really been maligned by the Democrats.We need border security. Without a border, as this gentleman can tell you also\u2014because the Prime Minister really was\u2014it was a very big factor in his win and other people's win in Italy\u2014but it was a big factor in my win. We need border security. Border security includes the wall, but it includes many other things. We have to end the lottery. We have to end the chain. The chain is like a disaster. You bring one person in, and you end up with 32 people. We have to end these horrible catch-and-relief\u2014release principles, where you catch somebody, you take their name, and you release them. You don't even know who they are. And then, they're supposed to come back to a court case, where they want us to hire thousands of judges. The whole thing is ridiculous. And we have to change our laws, and we do that through Congress.So I would certainly be willing to close it down to get it done. As you know, we are already approving things in various bills, including, we're going to be taking care of the military. We always put the military and law enforcement very high. But I would be certainly willing to consider a shutdown if we don't get proper border security.

Thank you, Mr. President. You spoke a bit about Iran today and your discussions, and I'm wondering if you could tell us what you think Iran needs to do to reduce some of the tensions. And you've met with the leaders of North Korea and Russia. Are you prepared also\u2014are you willing to meet with President Rouhani? And under what conditions? And have there been any preliminary discussions about something like that?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI'll meet with anybody. I believe in meeting. The Prime Minister said it better than anybody can say it: Speaking to other people, especially when you're talking about potentials of war and death and famine and lots of other things, you meet. There's nothing wrong with meeting. We met, as you know, with Chairman Kim. And it\u2014you haven't had a missile fired off in 9 months. We got our prisoners back. So many things have happened so positive.But meeting with people\u2014I had a great meeting, in my opinion. Of course, the fake news didn't cover it that way. But I had a great meeting with President Putin of Russia. I think it was a great meeting. In terms of the future, in terms of safety and economic development and protecting Israel and protecting everybody, I thought it was a great meeting.Great meeting with NATO. I just explained NATO. Hundreds of billions of dollars more money will be paid into NATO, the coffers of NATO. And much already has.So I believe in meeting. I would certainly meet with if they wanted to meet. I don't know that they're ready yet. They're having a hard time right now. But I ended the deal; it was a ridiculous deal.

So many things have happened so positive.But meeting with people\u2014I had a great meeting, in my opinion. Of course, the fake news didn't cover it that way. But I had a great meeting with President Putin of Russia. I think it was a great meeting. In terms of the future, in terms of safety and economic development and protecting Israel and protecting everybody, I thought it was a great meeting.Great meeting with NATO. I just explained NATO.

Good afternoon, my name is Alexei Meshkov, Interfax information agency. I have a question to President Trump. During your recent European tour, you've mentioned that the implementation of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline makes Europe the hostage of Russia. And you suggested that you could free Europe from this by supplying American LNG. But this cold winter actually showed that the current model\u2014current mechanism of the supply of fuel to Europe is quite viable. At the same time, as far as I know, U.S. had to buy even Russian gas for Boston.I have a question. The implementation of your idea has a political tinge to it, or is this a practical one? Because there will be a gap formed in the supply and demand mechanism, and first it's the consuming countries who will fall into this gap.And the second question: Before the meeting with President Putin, you called him an adversary, a rival, and yet you expressed hope that you will be able to bring this relationship to a new level. Did you manage to do this?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nActually, I called him a competitor And a good competitor he is And I think the word competitor is a\u2014it's a compliment I think that we will be competing, when you talk about the pipeline I'm not sure necessarily that it's in the best interest of Germany or not, but that was a decision that they made We'll be competing\u2014as you know, the United States is now, or soon will be\u2014but I think it actually is right now\u2014the largest in the oil and gas worldSo we're going to be selling LNG, and we'll have to be competing with the pipeline And I think we'll compete successfully, although there is a little advantage locationally So I just wish them luck I mean, I did I discussed with Angela Merkel in pretty strong tones But I also know where they're all coming from And they have a very close source So we'll see how that all works outBut we have lots of sources now, and the United States is much different than it was a number of years ago when we weren't able to extract what we can extract today So today we're number one in the world at that And I think we'll be out there competing very stronglyThank you very much If I may, I'd throw in some two cents We talked to Mr President, including this subject as well We are aware of the stance of And I think that we, as a major oil and gas power\u2014and the United States, as a major oil and gas power as well\u2014we could work together on regulation of international markets, because neither of us is actually interested in the plummeting of the pricesAnd the consumers will suffer as well, and the consumers in the United States will suffer as well, and the shale gas production will suffer Because beyond a certain price bracket, it's no longer profitable to produce gas, but nor we are interested in driving prices up, because it will drain juices\u2014life juices\u2014from all other sectors of the economy, from machine building, et cetera So we do have space for cooperation here, as the first thingThen, about the Nord Stream 2, Mr President voiced his concerns about the possibility of disappearance of transit through Ukraine And I reassured Mr President that Russia stands ready to maintain this transit Moreover, we stand ready to extend this transit contract that is about to expire next year, in case\u2014if the dispute between the economic entities, dispute will be settled in the Stockholm arbitration courtWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders The first question for a US journalist goes to Jeff Mason, from ReutersRussia-US Relations/\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nThe implementation of President Trump's idea of supplying American LNG to Europe: Is it politically motivated or practical?

Mr. President, you tweeted this morning that it's U.S. foolishness, stupidity, and the Mueller probe that is responsible for the decline in U.S. relations with Russia. Do you hold Russia at all accountable for anything in particular? And if so, what would you consider them\u2014that they are responsible for?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes, I do I hold both countries responsible I think that the United States has been foolish I think we've all been foolish We should have had this dialogue a long time ago\u2014a long time, frankly, before I got to office And I think we're all to blame I think that the United States now has stepped forward, along with Russia And we're getting together And we have a chance to do some great things, whether it's nuclear proliferation, in terms of stopping\u2014because we have to do it Ultimately, that's probably the most important thing that we can be working onBut I do feel that we have both made some mistakes I think that the probe is a disaster for our country I think it's kept us apart It's kept us separated There was no collusion at all Everybody knows it People are being brought out to the foreSo far, that I know, virtually none of it related to the campaign And they're going to have to try really hard to find somebody that did relate to the campaign That was a clean campaign I beat Hillary Clinton easily And frankly, we beat her\u2014and I'm not even saying from the standpoint\u2014we won that race And it's a shame that there can even be a little bit of a cloud over itPeople know that People understand it But the main thing, and we discussed this also, is zero collusion And it has had a negative impact upon the relationship of the two largest nuclear powers in the world We have 90 percent of nuclear power between the two countries It's ridiculous It's ridiculous what's going on with the probe\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\n.

And if so, what would you consider them\u2014that they are responsible for?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes, I do I hold both countries responsible I think that the United States has been foolish I think we've all been foolish We should have had this dialogue a long time ago\u2014a long time, frankly, before I got to office And I think we're all to blame I think that the United States now has stepped forward, along with Russia And we're getting together And we have a chance to do some great things, whether it's nuclear proliferation, in terms of stopping\u2014because we have to do it Ultimately, that's probably the most important thing that we can be working onBut I do feel that we have both made some mistakes I think that the probe is a disaster for our country I think it's kept us apart It's kept us separated There was no collusion at all Everybody knows it People are being brought out to the foreSo far, that I know, virtually none of it related to the campaign And they're going to have to try really hard to find somebody that did relate to the campaign That was a clean campaign I beat Hillary Clinton easily And frankly, we beat her\u2014and I'm not even saying from the standpoint\u2014we won that race And it's a shame that there can even be a little bit of a cloud over itPeople know that People understand it But the main thing, and we discussed this also, is zero collusion And it has had a negative impact upon the relationship of the two largest nuclear powers in the world We have 90 percent of nuclear power between the two countries It's ridiculous It's ridiculous what's going on with the probe\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAnd if so, what would you consider them\u2014that they are responsible for?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

For President Putin, if I could follow up as well. Why should Americans and why should President Trump believe your statement that Russia did not intervene in the 2016 election, given the evidence that U.S. intelligence agencies have provided? And will you consider extraditing the 12 Russian officials that were indicted last week by a U.S. grand jury?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I'm going to let the President answer the second part of that question But, as you know, the whole concept of that came up perhaps a little bit before, but it came out as a reason why the Democrats lost an election, which, frankly, they should have been able to win, because the electoral college is much more advantageous for Democrats, as you know, than it is to RepublicansWe won the electoral college by a lot\u2014306 to 223, I believe And that was a well-fought\u2014that was a well-fought battle We did a great jobAnd, frankly, I'm going to let the President speak to the second part of your question But just to say it one time again, and I say it all the time: There was no collusion I didn't know the President There was nobody to collude with There was no collusion with the campaign And every time you hear all of these\u2014you know, 12 and 14\u2014it's stuff that has nothing to do\u2014and frankly, they admit, these are not people involved in the campaignBut to the average reader out there, they're saying, Well, maybe that does It doesn't And even the people involved, some perhaps told mis-stories or, though in one case, the FBI said there was no lie There was no lie Somebody else said there wasWe ran a brilliant campaign, and that's why I'm President Thank you As to who is to be believed and to who is not to be believed, you can trust no one, if you take this Where did you get this idea that President Trump trusts me or I trust him? He defends the interests of the United States of America, and I do defend the interests of the Russian FederationWe do have interests that are common We are looking for points of contact There are issues where our postures diverge, and we are looking for ways to reconcile our differences; how to make our effort more meaningfulWe should not proceed from the immediate political interests that guide certain political powers in our countries We should be guided by facts Could you name a single fact that would definitively prove the collusion? This is utter nonsense, just like the President recently mentionedYes, the public at large in the United States had a certain perceived opinion of the candidates during the campaign, but there's nothing particularly extraordinary about it That's the usual thing President Trump, when he was a candidate, he mentioned the need to restore the Russia-US relationship, and it's clear that a certain part of American society felt sympathetic about it, and different people could express their sympathy in different ways But isn't that natural? Isn't it natural to be sympathetic towards a person who is willing to restore the relationship with our country, who wants to work with us?We heard the accusations about the Concord country Well, as far as I know, this company hired American lawyers And the accusations doesn't\u2014doesn't have a fighting chance in the American courts So there's no evidence when it comes to the actual facts So we have to be guided by facts and not by rumorsNow, let's get back to the issue of these 12 alleged intelligence officers of Russia I don't know the full extent of the situation, but the President Trump mentioned this issue, and I will look into itSo far, I can say the following, the things that\u2014off the top of my head: We have an acting\u2014an existing agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation, an existing treaty that dates back to 1999, the Mutual Assistance on Criminal Cases This treaty is in full effect It works quite efficientlyOn average, we initiate about a hundred, hundred and fifty criminal cases upon request from foreign states For instance, the last year, there was one extradition case, upon the request, sent by the United States So this treaty has specific legal proceduresWe can offer that the appropriate commission headed by Special Attorney Mueller\u2014he can use this treaty as a solid foundation, and send a formal, an official request to us so that we would interrogate\u2014we would hold the questioning of these individuals who he believes are privy to some crimes And our law enforcement are perfectly able to do this questioning and send the appropriate materials to the United StatesMoreover, we can meet you halfway; we can make another step We can actually permit official representatives of the United States, including the members of this very commission headed by Mr Mueller\u2014we can let them into the country and they will be present at this questioningBut in this case, there is another condition This kind of effort should be a mutual one Then we would expect that the Americans would reciprocate, and they would question officials, including the officers of law enforcement and intelligence services of the United States whom we believe are\u2014who have something to do with illegal actions on the territory of Russia, and we have to request the presence of our law enforcementFor instance, we can bring up the\u2014Mr Browder in this particular case Business associates of Mr Browder have earned over $1\u00bd billion in Russia They never paid any taxes, neither in Russia nor in the United States, and yet the money escaped the country They were transferred to the United States They sent a huge amount of money\u2014400 million\u2014as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton Well, that's their personal case It might have been legal, the contribution itself, but the way the money was earned was illegalSo we have a solid reason to believe that some intelligence officers accompanied and guided these transactions So we have an interest of questioning them We can\u2014that could be a first step, and we can also extend it Options abound, and they all can be found in an appropriate legal framework\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhy should Americans and why should President Trump believe your statement that Russia did not intervene in the 2016 election, given the evidence that U.S. intelligence agencies have provided?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

A question for each President. President Trump\u2014\u2014 President Trump. Yes. Q. \u2014\u2014you first. Just now, President Putin denied having anything to do with the election interference in 2016. Every U.S. intelligence agency has concluded that Russia did. What\u2014who\u2014my first question for you, sir, is, who do you believe?My second question is, would you now, with the whole world watching, tell President Putin\u2014would you denounce what happened in 2016? And would you warn him to never do it again?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nSo let me just say that we have two thoughts You have groups that are wondering why the FBI never took the server Why haven't they taken the server? Why was the FBI told to leave the office of the Democratic National Committee? I've been wondering that I've been asking that for months and months, and I've been tweeting it out and calling it out on social media Where is the server? I want to know: Where is the server? And what is the server saying?With that being said, all I can do is ask the question My people came to me\u2014Dan Coats came to me and some others\u2014they said they think it's Russia I have President Putin; he just said it's not RussiaI will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be, but I really do want to see the server But I have\u2014I have confidence in both parties I really believe that this will probably go on for a while, but I don't think it can go on without finding out what happened to the server What happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC? Where are those servers? They're missing Where are they? What happened to Hillary Clinton's e-mails? Thirty-three thousand e-mails gone\u2014just gone I think, in Russia, they wouldn't be gone so easily I think it's a disgrace that we can't get Hillary Clinton's 33,000 e-mailsSo I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today And what he did is an incredible offer; he offered to have the people working on the case come and work with their investigators with respect to the 12 people I think that's an incredible offerOkay? Thank you Yes, please I'd like to add something to this After all, I was an intelligence officer myself, and I do know how dossiers are made up Just a quick\u2014just a second That's the first thingNow, the second thing: I believe that Russia is a democratic state, and I hope you're not denying this right to your own country You're not denying that United States is a democracy Do you believe the United States is a democracy?

No, it does not Well, it's the same case There is the issue of trying a case in the court, and the final say is for the court to deliver We are now talking about the private\u2014the individuals, and not about particular states And as far as the most recent allegation is concerned about the Russian intelligence officers, we do have an intergovernmental treaty Please, do send us the request We will analyze it properly, and we'll send a formal responseAnd as I said, we can extend this cooperation, but we should do it on a reciprocal basis, because we would await our Russian counterparts to provide us access to the persons of interest for us who we believe can have something to do with intelligence servicesLet's discuss the specific issues, and not use the Russia and the US relationship as a loose change\u2014the loose change for this internal political struggle\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWho does President Trump believe in regards to election interference in 2016?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Well, it's difficult to imagine an utter nonsense of a bigger scale than thisWell, please, just disregard these issues and don't think about this anymore again And I have to say, if they had it, it would have been out long ago And if anybody watched Peter Strzok testify over the last couple of days\u2014and I was in Brussels watching it\u2014it was a disgrace to the FBI, it was a disgrace to our country, and, you would say, that was a total witch huntThank you very much, everybody Thank you Thank you\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDoes the Russian Government have any compromising material on President Trump or his family?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you very much, Prime Minister and Mr. President. Laura Kuenssberg, BBC News. Mr. President, you seem rather to have changed your tune from what you said earlier this week, when you said that, on the current Brexit plan, that would probably kill the possibility of a trade deal with the U.K. Our countries are meant to have a special relationship, yet you publicly criticized the Prime Minister's policy and her personally for not listening to you this week. Is that really the behavior of a friend?And, Prime Minister, is it a problem for you that some of the things Mr. Trump has said about your Brexit plan are right? It will limit the possibilities of doing trade deals easily in the future. Can you also tell us how it felt for him to criticize you in the way he did in that interview?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, maybe I'll go first, because I didn't criticize the I have a lot of respect for the And unfortunately, there was a story that was done, which was generally fine, but it didn't put in what I said about the And I said tremendous things. And fortunately, we tend to record stories now, so we have it for your enjoyment if you'd like it. But we record when we deal with reporters. It's called fake news. You know, we solve a lot of problems with the good, old recording instrument.But what happens is that\u2014look, the Prime Minister, as I really just said, she's going to make a decision as to what she's going to do. The only thing I ask of Theresa is that we make sure we can trade, that we don't have any restrictions, because we want to trade with the U.K., and the U.K. wants to trade with us. We're, by far, their biggest trading partner. And we have just a tremendous opportunity to double, triple, quadruple that.So if they're going a slightly different route\u2014and I know they do want independence. It's going to be independence; it's just your definition. But if they're going to go a certain route, I just said that I hope you're going to be able to trade with the United States. I read reports where that won't be possible, but I believe after speaking with the Prime Minister's people and representatives and trade experts, it will absolutely be possible.So, based on that, I\u2014and based on just trade in general, and our other relationship\u2014which will be fine\u2014but the trade is a little bit tricky. We want to be able to trade, and they want to be able to trade, and I think we'll be able to do that. Okay? And I think she's doing a terrific job, by the way.. Thank you, Mr. President. And just to confirm what the President just said, Laura, there will be no limit to the possibility of us doing trade deals around the rest of the world once we leave the European Union, on the basis of the agreement that was made here at Chequers and that I've put forward to the European Union. And just to be clear, that is an agreement that delivers on the Brexit vote that we had in 2016 here in the U.K., that delivers what I believe is at the forefront of people's mind when they were voting to leave the European Union.So at the end of these negotiations, we will ensure that free movement will come to an end. The jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice here in the U.K. will come to an end. The sending of vast sums of money every year to the EU will come to an end. We will come out of the Common Agricultural Policy. We will come out of the Common Fisheries Policy. And we will ensure, by not being in the Customs Union, that we are able to have an independent trade policy and do those trade deals around the world. And as you've heard from the President, the United States is keen for us. We're keen to work with them. And we will do a trade deal with them and with others around the rest of the world.Mr. President, would you like to select a person? Jonathan Swan, go ahead. /North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nMr. President, you seem rather to have changed your tune from what you said earlier this week, when you said that, on the current Brexit plan, that would probably kill the possibility of a trade deal with the U.K. Our countries are meant to have a special relationship, yet you publicly criticized the Prime Minister's policy and her personally for not listening to you this week.

Francis Elliott, the Times. Prime Minister, I wonder whether you agree with the President of the United States that immigration has damaged the cultural fabric of Europe. And, President, perhaps you could elaborate on that remark. What do you mean by that?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYou want me to go?. Do you want to go first? I think it's been very bad for Europe. I think Europe is a place I know very well, and I think that what has happened is very tough. It's a very tough situation. I mean, you see the same terror attacks that I do. We see them a lot. We just left some incredible young men\u2014men and women\u2014at Sandhurst. And they were showing us cells, and they were showing us things that, frankly, 20 years ago nobody even thought about. Probably a lot more recently than that, nobody even thought about.I just think it's changing the culture. I think it's a very negative thing for Europe. I think it's very negative. I think having Germany\u2014and I have a great relationship with Angela Merkel. Great relationship with Germany. But I think that's very much hurt Germany. I think it's very much hurt other parts of Europe.And I know it's politically\u2014not necessarily\u2014correct to say that. But I'll say it, and I'll say it loud. And I think they better watch themselves because you are changing culture. You are changing a lot of things. You're changing security. You're changing\u2014look at what's happening. I mean, you take a look. I mean, look at what's happening to different countries that never had difficulty, never had problems.It's a very sad situation. It's very unfortunate. But I do not think it's good for Europe, and I don't think it's good for our country. We're, as you know, far superior to anything that's happened before, but we have very bad immigration laws, and we're\u2014I mean, we're doing incredibly well considering the fact that we virtually don't have immigration laws. We have laws that are so bad, I don't even call them laws. I call them\u2014it's just like, you just walk across the border. You walk across the border\u2014you put one foot on the land and now you're tied up in a lawsuit for 5 years. It's the craziest thing anyone has ever seen.So I would just make that recommendation to Europe. I've made it very loud and clear. I made it yesterday in\u201429 countries total. And that's the way I feel.. The U.K. has a proud history of welcoming people who are fleeing persecution to our country. We have a proud history of welcoming people who want to come to our country to contribute to our economy and contribute to our society.

Francis Elliott, the Times. Prime Minister, I wonder whether you agree with the President of the United States that immigration has damaged the cultural fabric of Europe. And, President, perhaps you could elaborate on that remark. What do you mean by that?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYou want me to go?. Do you want to go first? I think it's been very bad for Europe. I think Europe is a place I know very well, and I think that what has happened is very tough. It's a very tough situation. I mean, you see the same terror attacks that I do. We see them a lot. We just left some incredible young men\u2014men and women\u2014at Sandhurst. And they were showing us cells, and they were showing us things that, frankly, 20 years ago nobody even thought about. Probably a lot more recently than that, nobody even thought about.I just think it's changing the culture. I think it's a very negative thing for Europe. I think it's very negative. I think having Germany\u2014and I have a great relationship with Angela Merkel. Great relationship with Germany. But I think that's very much hurt Germany. I think it's very much hurt other parts of Europe.And I know it's politically\u2014not necessarily\u2014correct to say that. But I'll say it, and I'll say it loud. And I think they better watch themselves because you are changing culture. You are changing a lot of things. You're changing security. You're changing\u2014look at what's happening. I mean, you take a look. I mean, look at what's happening to different countries that never had difficulty, never had problems.It's a very sad situation. It's very unfortunate. But I do not think it's good for Europe, and I don't think it's good for our country. We're, as you know, far superior to anything that's happened before, but we have very bad immigration laws, and we're\u2014I mean, we're doing incredibly well considering the fact that we virtually don't have immigration laws. We have laws that are so bad, I don't even call them laws. I call them\u2014it's just like, you just walk across the border. You walk across the border\u2014you put one foot on the land and now you're tied up in a lawsuit for 5 years. It's the craziest thing anyone has ever seen.So I would just make that recommendation to Europe. I've made it very loud and clear. I made it yesterday in\u201429 countries total. And that's the way I feel.. The U.K. has a proud history of welcoming people who are fleeing persecution to our country. We have a proud history of welcoming people who want to come to our country to contribute to our economy and contribute to our society. And over the years, overall, immigration has been good for the U.K. It's brought people with different backgrounds, different outlooks here to the U.K. and has\u2014and we've seen them contributing to our society and to our economy.Of course, what is important is that we have control of our borders.

But how do you get him out? President Trump. Well, we'll have to see what happens, you know? I'm not bad at doing things. If you look at what I've done compared to what other people have done 160 days in, there's nobody even close, I don't believe. So let's see what happens. But this was an Obama disaster. And I think if I were President then, he would not have taken over Crimea. During the Obama administration, he essentially took over Crimea. I don't think he would have done that with me as President, John.Russia's Annexation of Crimea/North Korea  Q. You\u2014I have a question for the Prime Minister.

We'll see how it all mills out.But I just want people to understand that Crimea was a\u2014you know, it was another bad hand. I got handed North Korea. We're doing very well. I\u2014you saw the letter yesterday. And we're doing very well. Look, we haven't had nuclear testing, we haven't had missile launches, we haven't had rocket launches. Some sites were blown up. And we got back our hostages, our prisoners, even before I left. So a lot of good things are happening. There's some good feeling there. We'll see what happens. It's a process. It's probably a longer process than anybody would like, but I'm used to long processes too.We haven't taken off the sanctions. The sanctions are biting. We haven't taken them off.But when it comes to Crimea, that's something I took over, John. There's nothing much I have to say about it, other than we will look at that just like I'm looking at many other disasters that I've taken over. I've taken over a lot of bad hands.

Biggest problem in the world.I understand nuclear. Look up Dr. John Trump at MIT, who was my uncle. Many, many years a professor. I used to talk nuclear with him. And this is many years ago.

And also\u2014and on denuclearization, can you spell out a little bit how you expect that to happen in terms of treaties and in terms of talks?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, it will be a slow process. Don't forget, we're not the only ones that have nukes. And it would be a slow process. But for the world, it would be us, and it would be others\u2014would have to come along simultaneously, obviously.But I think that when I\u2014when the meeting was arranged\u2014and we both wanted the meeting\u2014when the meeting was arranged, it was\u2014from my standpoint, I don't\u2014I didn't go in with high expectations, but you may come out with something very exceptional.But the proliferation is a tremendous\u2014I mean, to me, it's the biggest problem in the world: nuclear weapons. Biggest problem in the world.I understand nuclear. Look up Dr. John Trump at MIT, who was my uncle. Many, many years a professor. I used to talk nuclear with him. And this is many years ago. It's the biggest problem, in my opinion, this world has. Nuclear weapons. So if we could do something to substantially reduce them\u2014I mean, ideally, get rid of them. It's\u2014maybe that's a dream. But certainly it's a subject that I'll be bringing up with him. And it's also a very expensive thing. But that's the least important. So if we can\u2014if we can do something.But I didn't go in\u2014and I was telling the Prime Minister before\u2014I didn't go in with high expectations. I mean, we have\u2014we do have a political problem where, you know, in the United States, we have this stupidity going on\u2014pure stupidity\u2014but it makes it very hard to do something with Russia. Anything you do, it's always going to be: Oh, Russia. He loves Russia. I love the United States. But I love getting along with Russia and China and other countries. And it will certainly be, Jeff, something that we bring up and talk about. I think, to me, it's such a big problem.Syria, of course, I'm going to bring that up, and I'm going to bring up Ukraine.

I'm going to talk to him about that before I talk to you. And if something happens, that will be great. And if it doesn't happen\u2014I'm not going in with high expectations, but we may come out with some very surprising things.But relationship is very important. And having a relationship with Russia and other countries, as I said a number of times, is\u2014and I've been saying, actually, for years\u2014and I've been certainly saying it during my campaign. Having relationships with other countries is really a good thing.I think that\u2014I can't really overestimate how big the meeting was yesterday with NATO. We went with something that really was an unfair situation to something that's unified. I mean, they had spirit. Those people were getting up, and in the end, Well, we are committing and we're\u2014you know, they can't go\u2014it's not like they can go immediately back. They have to go through their parliaments and their congresses and their representatives and whoever, whatever form they have. But they have to go through an approval process.But I'll tell you what: Every single person in that room was gung-ho to get it done, get the money in. And even before that, as you know, $34 billion. And I think that the Secretary General\u2014Stoltenberg is doing a terrific job, by the way\u2014he said yesterday that Because of , we've taken in $34 billion more for NATO. And I think the number is actually much higher than that. But $34 billion more, at least. And again, that's nothing that my opponent would have done. My opponent would have\u2014it would have just kept going down. You know, it was going down. You see what was happening over the years. The numbers were going down. Now the number is way up, and now it's going way up higher.

Mr. President, I'm Tara McKelvey with the BBC. Can you tell us whether or not you warned people that the U.S. would pull out of NATO if they weren't meeting their spending goals?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI told people that I'd be very unhappy if they didn't up their commitments very substantially, because the United States has been paying a tremendous amount, probably 90 percent of the cost of NATO. And now people are going to start and countries are going to start upping their commitments. So I let them know yesterday, actually. I was surprised that you didn't pick it up; it took until today. But yesterday I let them know that I was extremely unhappy with what was happening, and they have substantially upped their commitment, yes.

They're going up to the 2 percent level. Now, you have to understand, some of them have parliaments, they have their own congresses, they have a lot of things they have to go through. So, you know, they're here as Prime Minister or as a President, and they can't necessarily go in and say, this is what we're going to do. But they're going back for approvals.Some are at 2 percent; others have agreed definitely to go to 2 percent. And some are going back to get the approval\u2014and which they will get\u2014to go to 2 percent. After the 2 percent, we'll start talking about going higher. But I said, Ultimately, we should be, in years\u2014in advance\u2014we should be at 4 percent. I think 4 percent\u2014it's the right number.Now, the United States\u2014depending on the way you calculate it\u2014was at 4.2 percent. And I said, That's unfair. And we have the largest GDP by far, especially since we've increased it by so much since a thing called the election. Our GDP has gone way up. And so the fact that our GDP went way up, that means we're paying for even more, which is very unfair.

So you tweeted yesterday, What good is NATO? And you've talked about NATO as an alliance that benefits Europe\u2014that defends and protects Europe.

Does it help protect the United States from Russia, in your view?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI think it's another very strong ally, as together it's much stronger than, obviously, individual countries. I think it's\u2014the way we have it now, I think it's a much\u2014I think NATO got\u2014you know what was happening with spending prior to my getting into office. Thenumbers were going down. Now the numbers have gone up like a rocket ship. The numbers have gone up a lot, and they've gone up rapidly. And they're now going up further.So I think NATO is going to be very, very effective. I'm very impressed with\u2014and really know, and he's a friend mine\u2014but Secretary General Stoltenberg has done a fantastic job and putting it all together. And we were the ones that really\u2014we gave him an extension of his contract, as you know. I think he's done a really good job.I think that when I was saying that, I am very concerned with the pipeline; I don't like the pipeline. And when I talk about NATO, I say, how do you have NATO? And then, you have somebody paying the people that you're protecting against. But maybe we'll get along with the group that we're protecting against. I think that's a real possibility.As you know, I'm meeting with President Putin on Monday. And I think we go into that meeting not looking for so much. We want to find out about Syria. We will, of course, ask your favorite question about meddling. I will be asking that question again. But we'll also be talking about other things. We'll be talking about Ukraine. Ukraine was here today, by the way. And you know, it was very interesting to hear what they had to say.

Hi, I'm Kristin Brown with Fox News. On your upcoming summit with President Putin, did any of your allies here express any specific concerns or talk to you about any messages that they'd like you to take with you when you go to the summit?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes. Just the opposite of concern. They actually\u2014and they'll probably come out with a little bit of an edict\u2014but they actually thanked me for meeting with President Putin. I look forward to the meeting. They thanked me. They thought it was a great thing that I was doing it. And they gave us our best wishes, or their best wishes.Now, with that being said, we'll see that happens. Just a loose meeting. It's not going to be big schedule. I don't think it should take a very long period of time. And we'll see where it leads. But it could lead to productive\u2014something very productive. And maybe it's not.But I think meeting with people is great. We had a great meeting with Chairman Kim. And I'll tell you, Mike Pompeo did a fantastic job. I might ask you to say a few words, Mike, while you're here.Just 1 second. Mike, go ahead. I'm done. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. So, I did. I returned\u2014I actually came straight from with a couple of stops here to Brussels. We had a productive conversation. There remains a great deal of work to do, but I think, most importantly, my counterpart, Kim Yong Chol, made a commitment consistent with what President Trump was able to achieve with Chairman Kim, which was: They intend to denuclearize. They're going to accomplish it. And now the task is to get it implemented.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDid any of your allies here express any specific concerns or talk to you about any messages that they'd like you to take with you when you go to the summit?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Ewen MacAskill from the Guardian. In your trip to the U.K., there are lots of protests planned in London and elsewhere. How do you feel to it\u2014about that?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI think it's fine. I mean, I think they like me a lot in the U.K. I think they agree with me on immigration. I'm very strong on immigration. I made a point today\u2014I said: You've got to stop. You're ruining your\u2014you're going to have a lot of problems. You see what's going on throughout the world with immigration. I probably, at least partially, won an election because of immigration.If you look at Italy, Giuseppe, who I got to know quite well over the last month and a half, he won his election because of strong immigration policies on Italy. I think that a lot of the people in the U.K.\u2014I think that's why Brexit happened. Now, I don't know what's going on with the negotiation. Who knows? But\u2014and I guess that's become a very interesting point of contention. I said I'm going to a few hotspots. We have NATO, then we have the U.K, and then we have Putin. And I said: Putin may be the easiest of them all. You never know. But I'm going to a pretty hotspot right now, right, with a lot of resignations.But I will say that immigration is a very important thing, and I told them today, the EU\u2014the European Union\u2014better be very careful, because immigration is taking over Europe, and they'd better be very, very careful. And I said that loud and clear.Yes, go ahead.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow do you feel about the planned protests in London and elsewhere during your trip to the U.K.?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

What will you tell President Putin about this summit and about NATO?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I think he's going to see about this summit\u2014this has turned out to be a very successful summit. This is\u2014I think, really, that NATO is more put together right now, is more coordinated. And I think there's a better spirit for NATO right now than perhaps they've ever had. It's richer than it ever was. The commitments are made at a higher level than they've ever been made. And the money to be paid out faster, far faster.You know, the 2 percent was a range, a goal. It wasn't something that they were committed to. Now it's a commitment. There's a big difference, the 2-percent number. And that's why somany people weren't reaching it or hitting it. It was just sort of, like, this amorphous number out there. Now it's a commitment, a real commitment.I think he's going to see that there's great unity, great spirit, great esprit de corps. And I think we're going to have a good meeting. Regardless of that, I think we're going to have a good meeting.But this was a fantastic 2 days. This was a really fantastic\u2014it all came together at the end. And yes, it was a little tough for a little while, but ultimately\u2014you can ask anybody at that meeting\u2014they're really liking what happened over the last 2 days. There's a great, great spirit leaving that room.Yes, sir. Go ahead.
