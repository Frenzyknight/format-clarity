Thank you, Mr. President. I know some of my colleagues will get into some specific issues, but I wanted to zoom out on your first year in office.Inflation is up. Your signature domestic legislation is stalled in Congress. In a few hours from now, the Senate\u2014an effort in the Senate to deal with voting rights and voting\u2014voting reform legislation is going to fail. COVID-19 is taking the lives of 1,500 Americans every day. And the Nation's divisions are just as raw as they were a year ago. Did you overpromise to the American public what you could achieve in your first year in office? And how do you plan to course-correct going forward?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWhy are you such an optimist? []Look, I didn't overpromise, and\u2014but I have probably outperformed what anybody thought would happen. The fact of the matter is that we're in a situation where we have made enormous progress. You mentioned the number of deaths from COVID; well, it was three times that not long ago. It's coming down. Everything is changing. It's getting better.Look, I didn't overpromise, but I think if you take a look at what we've been able to do, you'd have to acknowledge we made enormous progress.But one of the things that I think is something that\u2014one thing I haven't been able to do so far is get my Republican friends to get in the game of making things better in this country. For example, I was reading the other day\u2014and I wrote the quote down so I don't misquote him\u2014a quote from Senator Sununu, when he decided that he wasn't going to\u2014excuse me, Governor Sununu\u2014when he decided he wasn't going to run for the Senate in New Hampshire.Here's what he said: They were all, for the most\u2014quote\u2014They were all, for the most part, content with the speed at which they weren't doing anything. It was very clear that we just had to hold the line for 2 years. Okay, so I'm just going to be a roadblock for the next 2 years? That's not what I do, Sununu said.He went on to say, It bothered me that they were okay with that. And then he goes on to say, I said, okay, so we're not going to get stuff done if we win the White House back\u2014if we win the White House back. Why didn't [we] do [anything] in 2017 and 2018? And then, he said\u2014how did the Republicans Sununu spoke to answer the challenge? He said: Crickets. Yes, crickets. They had no answer.I did not anticipate that there'd be such a stalwart effort to make sure that the most important thing was that President Biden didn't get anything done. Think about this: What are Republicans for? What are they for? Name me one thing they're for.And so the problem here is that I think what happens\u2014what I have to do, and the change in tactic, if you will: I have to make clear to the American people what we are for. We've passed a lot. We've passed a lot of things that people don't even understand what's all that's in it, understandably.Remember when we passed the Affordable Care Act and everybody thought that\u2014you know, and it really was getting pummeled and beaten? And it wasn't until after you're out of office, and that next campaign when\u2014that off-year campaign. And I went into a whole\u2014I wasn't in office anymore. We were in a whole bunch of districts campaigning for Democrats in Republican districts who said they wanted to do away with health care, with Obamacare.And I started pointing out that if you did that, preexisting conditions would no longer be covered. And they said: Huh? We didn't know that. We didn't know that. And guess what? We won over 38 seats because we explained to the people exactly what, in fact, had passed.And one of the things that I remember saying\u2014and I'll end this\u2014I remember saying to President Obama, when he passed the Affordable Care Act\u2014I said, You ought to take a victory lap. And he said, There's so many things going on, we have don't have time to take a victory lap.As a consequence, no one knew what the detail of the legislation was. They don't know a lot of the detail of what we passed. So the difference is, I'm going to be out on the road a lot, making the case around the country, with my colleagues who are up for reelection and others, making the case of what we did do and what we want to do, what we need to do.And so I don't think I've overpromised at all. And I'm going to stay on this track.You know, one of the things that I remember\u2014and I'll end this with\u2014I was talking with, you know, Jim Clyburn, who was a great help to me in the campaign in South Carolina. And Jim said\u2014and when he would endorse me\u2014and there was a clip on television the last couple days of Jim. And it said that we want to make things accessible and affordable for all Americans. That's health care, that's education, that's prescription drugs, that's making sure you have access\u2014access\u2014to all the things that everybody else has. We can afford to do that. We can't afford not to do it.So I tell my Republican friends: Here I come. This is going to be about, What are you for?\u2014What are you for?\u2014and lay out what we're for.Mary Bruce, ABC.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDid you overpromise to the American public what you could achieve in your first year in office?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned your Republican colleagues. But right now, your top two legislative priorities\u2014your social spending package and voting rights legislation\u2014are stalled, blocked by your own party, after months of negotiation.You are only guaranteed control of Washington for 1 more year before the midterms. Do you need to be more realistic and scale down these priorities in order to get something passed?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNo, I don't think so. When you say more realistic, I think it's extremely realistic to say to people, because\u2014let me back up. You all really know the politics in this country, and your networks and others. You've spent a lot of time, which I'm glad you do, polling this data, determining where the\u2014what the American people's attitudes are, et cetera. The American people overwhelmingly agree with me on prescription drugs. They overwhelmingly agree with me on the cost of education. They overwhelmingly agree with me on early education. They overwhelmingly\u2014and go on the list\u2014on childcare.And so we just have to make the case what we're for and what the other team is not for. Look, we knew all along that a lot of this was going to be an uphill fight. And one of the ways to do this is to make sure we make the contrast as clear as we can.And one of the things that I think is\u2014we're going to have to do is just make the case. I don't think there's anything unrealistic about what we're asking. I'm not trying to\u2014I'm not asking for castles in the sky; I'm asking for practical things the American people have been asking for for a long time\u2014a long time. And I think we can get it done.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo you need to be more realistic and scale down these priorities in order to get something passed?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, Mr. President. Speaking of voting rights legislation, if this isn't passed, do you still believe the upcoming election will be fairly conducted and its results will be legitimate?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, it all depends on whether or not we're able to make the case to the American people that some of this is being set up to try to alter the outcome of the election. And it's one thing\u2014look, maybe I'm just being too much of an optimist. Remember how we thought not that many people were going to show up to vote in the middle of a pandemic? We had the highest voter turnout in the history of the United States of America.Well, I think if in fact\u2014no matter how hard they make it for minorities to vote, I think you're going to see them willing to stand in line and defy the attempt to keep them from being able to vote. I think you're going to see the people who they're trying to keep from being able to show up, showing up and making the sacrifice that needs to make in order to change the law back to what it should be.And\u2014but it's going to be difficult.

Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. Your top foreign policy advisers have warned that Russia is now ready to attack Ukraine. But there's still little unity among European allies about what a package of sanctions against Moscow would look like. If the U.S. and NATO aren't willing to put troops on the line to defend Ukraine and American allies can't agree on a sanctions package, hasn't the U.S. and the West lost nearly all of its leverage over Vladimir Putin?And given how ineffective sanctions have been in deterring Putin in the past, why should the threat of new sanctions give him pause?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, because he's never seen sanctions like the ones I promised will be imposed if he moves, number one.Number two, we're in a situation where Vladimir Putin is about to\u2014we've had very frank discussions, Vladimir Putin and I. And the idea that NATO is not going to be united, I don't buy. I've spoken to every major NATO leader. We've had the NATO-Russian summit. We've had other\u2014the OSCE has met, et cetera.And so I think what you're going to see is that Russia will be held accountable if it invades. And it depends on what it does. It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and then we end up having a fight about what to do and not do, et cetera.But if they actually do what they're capable of doing with the forces amassed on the border, it is going to be a disaster for Russia if they further invade Ukraine, and that our allies and partners are ready to impose severe costs and significant harm on Russia and the Russian economy.And you know, we're going to fortify our NATO allies, I told him, on the eastern flank\u2014if, in fact, he does invade. We're going to\u2014I've already shipped over $600 million worth of sophisticated equipment, defensive equipment to the Ukrainians.The cost of going into Ukraine, in terms of physical loss of life, for the Russians, they'll\u2014they'll be able to prevail over time, but it's going to be heavy, it's going to be real, and it's going to be consequential.In addition to that, Putin has\u2014you know, has a stark choice: He\u2014either deescalation or diplomacy; confrontation or the consequences.And look, I think you're going to see\u2014for example, everybody talks about how Russia has control over the energy supply that Europe absorbs. Well, guess what? That money that they earn from that makes about 45 percent of the economy. I don't see that as a one-way street. They go ahead and cut it off\u2014it's like my mother used to say: You bite your nose off to spite your face. It's not like they have all these wonderful choices out there.I spoke with the Prime Minister of Finland. And you know, we're talking about concern on the part of Finland and Sweden about what Russia is doing. The last thing that Russia needs is Finland deciding to change its status. They didn't say they're going to do that, but they're talking about what, in fact, is going on and how outrageous Russia is being.We're finding ourselves in a position where I believe you will see that there'll be severe economic consequences. For example, anything that involves dollar denominations, if they make\u2014if they invade, they're going to pay; they're not going\u2014their banks will not be able to deal in dollars.So there's\u2014a lot is going to happen.But here's the thing: My conversation with Putin\u2014and we've been\u2014how can we say it? We have no problem understanding one another. He has no problem understanding me, nor me him. And the direct conversations where I pointed out\u2014I said: You know, you've occupied, before, other countries. But the price has been extremely high. How long? You can go in and, over time, at great loss and economic loss, go in and occupy Ukraine. But how many years? One? Three? Five? Ten? What is that going to take? What toll does that take? It's real. It's consequential.So this is not all just a cakewalk for Russia.Militarily, they have overwhelming superiority, and on\u2014as it relates to Ukraine. But they'll pay a stiff price\u2014immediately, near term, medium term, and long term\u2014if they do it.Umm\u2014I'm sorry. Okay.

It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and then we end up having a fight about what to do and not do, et cetera.But if they actually do what they're capable of doing with the forces amassed on the border, it is going to be a disaster for Russia if they further invade Ukraine, and that our allies and partners are ready to impose severe costs and significant harm on Russia and the Russian economy.And you know, we're going to fortify our NATO allies, I told him, on the eastern flank\u2014if, in fact, he does invade. We're going to\u2014I've already shipped over $600 million worth of sophisticated equipment, defensive equipment to the Ukrainians.The cost of going into Ukraine, in terms of physical loss of life, for the Russians, they'll\u2014they'll be able to prevail over time, but it's going to be heavy, it's going to be real, and it's going to be consequential.In addition to that, Putin has\u2014you know, has a stark choice: He\u2014either deescalation or diplomacy; confrontation or the consequences.And look, I think you're going to see\u2014for example, everybody talks about how Russia has control over the energy supply that Europe absorbs. Well, guess what? That money that they earn from that makes about 45 percent of the economy. I don't see that as a one-way street. They go ahead and cut it off\u2014it's like my mother used to say: You bite your nose off to spite your face. It's not like they have all these wonderful choices out there.I spoke with the Prime Minister of Finland. And you know, we're talking about concern on the part of Finland and Sweden about what Russia is doing. The last thing that Russia needs is Finland deciding to change its status. They didn't say they're going to do that, but they're talking about what, in fact, is going on and how outrageous Russia is being.We're finding ourselves in a position where I believe you will see that there'll be severe economic consequences. For example, anything that involves dollar denominations, if they make\u2014if they invade, they're going to pay; they're not going\u2014their banks will not be able to deal in dollars.So there's\u2014a lot is going to happen.But here's the thing: My conversation with Putin\u2014and we've been\u2014how can we say it? We have no problem understanding one another. He has no problem understanding me, nor me him. And the direct conversations where I pointed out\u2014I said: You know, you've occupied, before, other countries. But the price has been extremely high. How long? You can go in and, over time, at great loss and economic loss, go in and occupy Ukraine. But how many years? One? Three? Five? Ten? What is that going to take? What toll does that take? It's real. It's consequential.So this is not all just a cakewalk for Russia.Militarily, they have overwhelming superiority, and on\u2014as it relates to Ukraine. But they'll pay a stiff price\u2014immediately, near term, medium term, and long term\u2014if they do it.Umm\u2014I'm sorry. Okay.

Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to follow up on your answer there about Russia and Ukraine. When you were in Geneva in June, you said to us, about President Putin, I think the last thing . . . he wants now is a cold war.Now, since then, of course, you've seen him gather these troops\u2014100,000 troops\u2014around Ukraine. Your Secretary of State said today he thought he could invade at any moment. You've seen the cyber attacks. And you've seen the demand that he have a sphere of influence in which you would withdraw all American troops and nuclear weapons from what used to be the Soviet bloc.So I'm wondering if you still think that the last thing he wants is a cold war. And has your view of him changed in the past few months? And if it has and he does invade, would your posture be to really move back to the kind of containment policy that you saw so often when you were still in the Senate?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThe answer is that I think he still does not want any full-blown war, number one.Number two, do I think he'll test the west, test the United States and NATO as significantly as he can? Yes, I think he will. But I think he'll pay a serious and dear price for it that he doesn't think now will cost him what it's going to cost him. And I think he will regret having done it.Now, whether or not\u2014I think that\u2014how can I say this in a public forum? I think that he is dealing with what I believe he thinks is the most tragic thing that's happened to Mother Russia\u2014in that the Berlin Wall came down, the empire has been lost, the near abroad is gone, et cetera. The Soviet Union has been split.But think about what he has. He has eight time zones, a burning tundra that will not freeze again naturally, a situation where he has a lot of oil and gas, but he is trying to find his place in the world between China and the west.And so I'm not so sure that he has\u2014David, I'm not so sure he has\u2014is certain what he's going to do. My guess is he will move in. He has to do something.And by the way, I've indicated to him\u2014the two things he said to me that he wants guarantees of: One is, Ukraine will never be part of NATO. And two, that NATO, or the\u2014there will not be strategic weapons stationed in Ukraine. Well, we could work out something on the second piece, depending what he does along the Russian line as well\u2014or the Russian border, in the European area of Russia.On the first piece, we have a number of treaties internationally and in Europe that suggest that you get to choose who you want to be with. But the likelihood that Ukraine is going to join NATO in the near term is not very likely, based on much more work they have to do in terms of democracy and a few other things going on there and whether or not the major allies in the west would vote to bring Ukraine in right now.So there's room to work if he wants to do that. But I think, as usual, he's going to\u2014well, I probably shouldn't go any further. But I think it will hurt him badly./North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo you still think that the last thing Putin wants is a Cold War?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

And I think what you're seeing is that we've been able to make progress on speeding up the access to materials. For example, one third of the cost\u2014of the increase in cost of living is the cost of automobiles.The reason automobiles have skyrocketed in price is because of the lack of computer chips. So we have the capacity, and we're going to do everything in our power to do it to become self-reliant on the computer chips that we need in order to be able to produce more automobiles. That's underway.We've already passed, within the context of another bill, money for that in the\u2014in the House of Representatives. It's before the House of Representatives now. But I think there's a way we can move to\u2014if we can move to get, for example, that one thing done, it can make a big difference in terms of the cost of\u2014the total cost of living.Now, with regard to the whole issue of energy prices, that gets a little more complicated. But you saw what happened when I was able to convince everyone from\u2014including China, India\u2014a number of other countries\u2014to agree with us to go into their version of the\u2014of their petroleum reserve to release more into the market so that\u2014that brought down the price about 12, 15 cents a gallon in some places, some places more.There's going to be a reckoning along the line here as to whether or not we're going to continue to see oil prices continue to go up in ways that are going up now, relative to what is going to\u2014what impact that's going to have on the producers.And so it's going to be hard. I think that's the place where most middle class people, working class people get hit the most. They pull up to a pump, and all of a sudden, instead of paying $2.40 a gallon, they're paying $5 a gallon. And that's going to be really difficult.But\u2014so we're going to continue to work on trying to increase oil supplies that are available. And I think there's ways in which we can be of some value added in terms of the price of gas\u2014natural gas and the like\u2014to take the burden off of European countries that are now totally dependent on Russia. But it's going to be hard. It's going to be very hard.But I think that we have to deal with\u2014for example, like I said, you have a circumstance where people are paying more for a pound of hamburger meat than they ever paid. Well, one of the reasons for that is, you don't have that many folks out there that are ones that are\u2014we've got the Big Four controlling it all.And so you're going to see, more and more, we're going to move on this competition piece to allow more and more smaller operations to come in and be able to engage in providing\u2014buying and providing the access to much cheaper meat than exists now. But it's going to be a haul.Now, and as you\u2014I assume the reason you said if I can't get Build Back Better is, it relates to what those 17 Nobel laureate economists said: that if in fact we could pass it, it would actually lower the impact on inflation, reduce inflation over time, et cetera.So there's a lot we have to do. It's not going to be easy, but I think we can get it done. But it's going to be painful for a lot of people in the meantime. That's why the single best way\u2014the single best way\u2014to take the burden off middle class and working class folks is to pass the Build Back Better piece that are things that they're paying a lot of money for it now.If you get to trade off higher gas as\u2014you're putting up with a higher price of hamburgers and gas, versus whether or not you're going to have to\u2014you're going to be able to pay for education and/or childcare and the like, I think most people would make the trade. Their bottom line would be better in middle class households.But it's going to be hard.

Thank you so much, Mr. President. This afternoon, the Senate Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell, said that the midterms elections are going to be a report card on your progress on inflation, border security, and standing up to Russia. Do you think that that's a fair way to look at it? And if so, how do you think that report card looks right now?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI think the report card is going to look pretty good, if that's where we're at. But look, the idea that\u2014Mitch has been very clear he's going to do anything to prevent Biden from being a success.And I get on with Mitch. I actually like Mitch McConnell. We like one another. But he has one straightforward objective: make sure that there's nothing I do that makes me look good in the mind\u2014in his mind with the public at large. And that's okay. I'm a big boy. I've been here before.But the fact is that I think that the\u2014I'm happy to debate and have a referendum on how I handle the economy, whether or not I've made progress on when\u2014look, again\u2014how can I\u2014I'm taking too long answering your questions. I apologize.I think that this\u2014the fundamental question is: What's Mitch for? What's he for on immigration? What's he for? What's he proposing to make anything better? What's he for dealing with Russia that's different than I'm proposing and many of his Republican friends or his colleagues are supporting as well? What's he for on these things? What are they for?So everything is a choice\u2014a choice.I think they\u2014look, I've laid out a proposal on immigration that if we passed it, we'd be in a totally different place right now. But we're not there because we don't have a single Republican vote. My buddy John McCain is gone.So, I mean, it's just\u2014it's going to take time. And again, I go back to\u2014I go back to Governor Sununu's quote.How long\u2014I mean\u2014a rhetorical question. I don't\u2014I know this is not fair to ask the press a question; I'm not asking you. But think about\u2014did you ever think that one man out of office could intimidate an entire party where they're unwilling to take any vote contrary to what he thinks should be taken for fear of being defeated in a primary?I've had five Republican Senators talk to me, bump into me\u2014quote, unquote\u2014or sit with me, who've told me that they agree with whatever I'm talking about for them to do. But, Joe, if I do it, I'm going to get defeated in a primary. We've got to break that. That's got to change.And I doubt\u2014you're all\u2014I'm not being\u2014it sounds like I'm being solicitous\u2014you're all bright as hell, well informed\u2014more informed than any group of people in America.

At your first press conference, 10 months ago, I asked you if there was anything you could do beyond legislation to protect voting rights. And at that time, you said, Yes, but I'm not going to lay out a strategy before you and the world now. Now that legislation appears to be hopelessly stalled, can you now lay out your strategy to protect voting rights?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I'm not prepared to do that in detail, in terms of the Executive orders I may be able to engage in and other things I can do. But one of\u2014the things we have done: We have significantly beefed up a number of enforcers in the Justice Department, who are there to challenge these unconstitutional efforts\u2014in our view\u2014unconstitutional efforts on the part of the Republicans to stack the election and subvert the outcome.We have begun to organize in ways that we didn't before in communities beyond the civil rights community to make the case to the rest of American people what's about to happen, what will happen if in fact these things move forward.If I had talked to you\u2014not you; I'm using you in a total sense. If I had talked to the public about the whole idea of subversion of elections by deciding who the electors are after the fact, I think people would've looked at me like, Whoa.I mean, I caught\u2014taught constitutional law for 20 years\u2014a three-credit course on the separation of powers. And\u2014on Saturday mornings, when I was a Senator. And I never thought we'd get into a place where we were talking about being able to actually\u2014what they tried to do this last time out is send different electors to the State legislative bodies to represent who won the election, saying that I didn't win, but a Republican candidate won. I doubt that anybody thought that would ever happen in America in the 21st century, but it's happening.And so I think\u2014I guess what I'm saying is, Nancy\u2014is that I think there are a number of things we can do, but I also think we will be able to get significant pieces of the legislation\u2014if we don't get it all now\u2014to build to get it so that we get a big chunk of the John Lewis legislation, as well as the fair elections bills.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAt your first press conference, 10 months ago, I asked you if there was anything you could do beyond legislation to protect voting rights.

But one of\u2014the things we have done: We have significantly beefed up a number of enforcers in the Justice Department, who are there to challenge these unconstitutional efforts\u2014in our view\u2014unconstitutional efforts on the part of the Republicans to stack the election and subvert the outcome.We have begun to organize in ways that we didn't before in communities beyond the civil rights community to make the case to the rest of American people what's about to happen, what will happen if in fact these things move forward.If I had talked to you\u2014not you; I'm using you in a total sense. If I had talked to the public about the whole idea of subversion of elections by deciding who the electors are after the fact, I think people would've looked at me like, Whoa.I mean, I caught\u2014taught constitutional law for 20 years\u2014a three-credit course on the separation of powers. And\u2014on Saturday mornings, when I was a Senator. And I never thought we'd get into a place where we were talking about being able to actually\u2014what they tried to do this last time out is send different electors to the State legislative bodies to represent who won the election, saying that I didn't win, but a Republican candidate won. I doubt that anybody thought that would ever happen in America in the 21st century, but it's happening.And so I think\u2014I guess what I'm saying is, Nancy\u2014is that I think there are a number of things we can do, but I also think we will be able to get significant pieces of the legislation\u2014if we don't get it all now\u2014to build to get it so that we get a big chunk of the John Lewis legislation, as well as the fair elections bills.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nCan you specifically lay out the executive orders and other actions you can take to protect voting rights?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, Mr. President. Very quickly on Russia\u2014I do have a number of domestic policy issues, but I'm\u2014on Russia very quickly: It seemed like you said that you have assessed, you feel as though he will move in. Has this administration, have you determined whether President Putin plans to invade or move into Ukraine, as you've said?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nLook, the only thing I'm confident of is that decision is totally, solely, completely a Putin decision. Nobody else is going to make that decision; no one else is going to impact that decision. He's making that decision.And I suspect it matters which side of the bed he gets up on in the morning as to exactly what he's going to do. And I think it is not irrational, if he wanted to, to talk about dealing with strategic doctrine and dealing with force structures in Europe and in the European parts of Russia.But I don't know if he's decided he wants to do that or not. So far, in the three meetings we've had\u2014OSCE and\u2014anyway\u2014have not produced anything because the impression I get from my Secretary of State, my National Security Adviser, and my other senior officials that are doing these meetings is that there's a question of whether the people they're talking to know what he's going to do.So the answer is\u2014but based on a number of criteria as to what he could do\u2014for example, for him to move in and occupy the whole country, particularly from the north, from Belarus, it's\u2014he's going to have to wait a little bit until the ground is frozen so he can cross.To move in a direction where he wants to talk about what's going\u2014we have\u2014we're continuing to provide for defense capacities to the Ukrainians. We're talking about what's going on in both the Baltic and the Black Sea, et cetera. There's a whole range of things that I'm sure he's trying to calculate how quickly he can do what he wants to do and what does he want to do.But I\u2014he's not\u2014he's an informed individual. And I'm sure\u2014I'm not sure\u2014I believe he's calculating what the immediate, short-term, and the near-term, and the long-term consequences of Russia will be. And I don't think he's made up his mind yet.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHas this administration, have you determined whether President Putin plans to invade or move into Ukraine, as you've said?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Non-Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

I was in Congressman Clyburn's district yesterday in South Carolina. You opened this news conference talking about him. I spoke to a number of Black voters who fought to get you elected, and now they feel as though you are not fighting hard enough for them and their priorities. And they told me they see this push on voting rights more as a last-minute PR push than it is a legitimate effort to get legislation passed.So what do you say to these Black voters who say that you do not have their backs, as you promised on the campaign trail?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI've had their back. I've had their back my entire career. I've never not had their back. And I started on the voting rights issues long, long ago. That's what got me involved in politics in the first place.And I think part of the problem is\u2014look, there's significant disagreement in every community on whether or not the timing of assertions made by people has been in a most timely way. So I'm sure that there are those who are saying that: Why didn't Biden push the John Lewis bill as hard as he pushed it the last month? Why didn't he push it 6 months ago as hard as he did now?The fact is that there is\u2014there's a timing that is not of one's own choice; it's somewhat dictated by events that are happening in country and around the world as to what the focus is.But part of the problem is, as well, I have not been out in the community nearly enough. I've been here an awful lot. I find myself in a situation where I don't get a chance to look people in the eye, because of both COVID and things that are happening in Washington, to be able to go out and do the things that I've always been able to do pretty well: connect with people, let them take a measure of my sincerity, let them take a measure of who I am.For example\u2014I mean, as I pointed out in South Carolina, you know, last time, when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I got the Act extended for 25 years, and I got Strom Thurmond to vote for it. That's what I've been doing my whole career. And so the idea that I\u2014that I didn't either anticipate or because I didn't speak to it as fervently as they want me to earlier.In the meantime, I was spending a lot of time\u2014spent hours and hours and hours talking with my colleagues on the Democratic side, trying to get them to agree that if in fact this occurred, if this push continued, that they would be there for John Lewis and\u2014anyway.So\u2014but I think that's\u2014that's a problem that is my own making by not communicating as much as I should have. Yet you find that when you deal with Members of the Black Caucus and others in the United States Congress, I still have very close working relationships.So it's like every community. I'm sure that there are those in the community, in\u2014I'm a big labor guy. I'm sure there's people in labor saying, Why haven't they been able to do A, B, C, or D?So it's just going to take a little bit of time.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nBlack voters feeling that the President is not fighting hard enough for them and their priorities.\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

We're going to see\u2014you've heard me say this before\u2014we're going to see more change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50 years because of technology, because of fundamental alterations and alliances that are occurring not because of any one individual, just because of the nature of things.And so I think you're going to see an awful lot of transition. And the question is: Can we keep up with it? Can we maintain the democratic institutions that we have, not just here but around the world, to be able to generate democratic consensus of how to proceed?It's going to be hard. It's going to be hard, but it requires\u2014it requires\u2014leadership to do it. And I'm not giving up on the prospect of being able to do that.Thank you.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nIs the country more unified than when you first took office?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

I'm going to go out and talk to the public. I'm going to do public fora. I'm going to interface with them. I'm going to make the case of what we've already done, why it's important, and what we'll do if\u2014what will happen if they support what else I want to do.Number two, I'm bringing in more and more\u2014now that I have time\u2014I mean, literally, like you, it's\u2014I'm not complaining. It's, you know, 12, 14 hours a day. No complaints. I really mean that sincerely.But now that certain of the big chunks have been put in place and we know the direction, I'm also going to be out there seeking the\u2014more advice of experts outside, from academia, to editorial writers, to think tanks. And I'm bringing them in, just like I did early on, bringing in Presidential historians to get their perspective on what we should be doing. Seeking more input, more information, more constructive criticism about what I should and shouldn't be doing.And the third thing I'm going to be doing a lot more of is being in a situation where I am able to bring\u2014I'm going to be deeply involved in the off\u2014these off-year elections. We're going to be raising a lot of money. We're going to be out there making sure that we're helping all of those candidates.And scores of them have already asked me to come in and campaign with them, to go out and make the case in plain, simple language as to what it is we've done, what we want to do, and why we think it's important.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAre you satisfied with your team here at the White House, sir?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

I'm not a Socialist. I'm a mainstream Democrat, and I have been.

Because it's not sufficient that we just have this country not have the virus or be able to control the virus, but that\u2014you can't build a wall high enough to keep a new variant out.So it requires\u2014one of the things that I want to do and we're contemplating\u2014figuring out how to do\u2014not\u2014we are contemplating how to get done\u2014and that is: How do we move in a direction where the world itself is vaccinated?It's not enough just to vaccinate 340 million\u2014fully vaccinate 340 million people in the United States.

Thank you, Mr. President. To follow up on some of the questions about the vaccination program, you've given dozens of speeches this year urging Americans to get vaccinated.

Awesome.I've got a couple of questions for you. Number one, you said that you want to convey your message by getting out there in the country. I wonder if you're planning on traveling also to South America and other countries in the Western Hemisphere, given the fact that China has gained a lot of influence in the region?And the second question is: What would be your message for residents in this country that are struggling every time they go to the gas station, every time they go to the grocery store and see the prices going high\u2014and the pharmacy? I happen to come from South Texas. What I saw a lot of\u2014a lot of people struggling financially in the last few months. And so I think you\u2014I wonder what is the message you want to spread to them?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I try to express\u2014I've asked\u2014I've tried to answer that seven different ways today about how to deal with inflation. But let me answer the first question.I've spent a lot of time in South America and in Latin America. When I was Vice President, I spent the bulk of my 8 years basically in Europe and/or in Latin America. I'm in contact with the leaders of the countries in South America, and we're working closely with making sure that we do everything\u2014for example, with the\u2014to deal with helping the countries in question, particularly those in Central America, to be able to help them with their ability to deal with the internal\u2014people don't sit around in Guatemala and say: I've got a great idea: Let's sell everything we have, give the money to a coyote, take us across a terribly dangerous trip up through Central America and up through Mexico, and drop us\u2014sneak us across the border, drop us in the desert. Won't that be fun?People leave because they have real problems. And one of the things that I've done, when I was a Vice President, and got support with\u2014although I don't have much Republican support anymore\u2014is provide billions of dollars to be able to say to those countries, Why are people leaving? And how are you going to reform your own system? And that's what we've worked on a long time. It still needs a lot more work. And we're focusing on that.I also believe\u2014I've spent a lot of time talking about and dealing with policy having to do with Maduro, who is little more than a dictator right now, and the same thing in Chile and\u2014not the same thing, but with Chile, as well as Argentina.So, look, I made a speech a while ago, when I was Vice President, saying that if we were smart, we have an opportunity to make the Western Hemisphere a united\u2014not united\u2014a democratic hemisphere. And we were moving in the right direction under our\u2014under the last administration\u2014the Obama-Biden administration.But so much damage was done as a consequence of the foreign policy decisions the last President made in Latin America, Central America, and South America that we now have\u2014when I call for a Summit of the Democracies\u2014I called that, and a number of nations showed up for this Summit of Democracy\u2014what is it that's going to allow us to generate\u2014we've actually had a reduction in the number of democracies in the world. And it seems to me there's nothing more important.We used to talk about, when I was a kid in college, about America's backyard. It's not America's backyard. Everything south of the Mexican border is America's front yard. And we're equal people. We don't dictate what happens in any other part of that\u2014of this continent or the South American continent. We have to work very hard on it.But the trouble is, we're having great difficulty making up for the mistakes that were made the last 4 years, and it's going to take some time.Yes. Gentleman in the back. And then I'll go to this side, okay?\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat is your message for residents in the country who are struggling with high gas prices, grocery store prices, and pharmacy costs?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Even, back in those days, Lindsey Graham.And so the difference here is, there seems to be a desire to work\u2014and I didn't say my agenda; I'm saying, what are they for? What\u2014what is their agenda? They had an agenda back in the administration when\u2014the 8 years we were President and Vice President, but I don't know what their agenda is now. What is it?The American public is outraged about the tax structure we have in America. What are they proposing to do about it? Anything? Have you heard anything? I mean, anything. I haven't heard anything.The American public is outraged about the fact that we're the\u2014the state of the environment\u2014the vast majority of the public. What have they done to do anything to ameliorate the climate change that's occurring, other than to deny it exists?So what I'm saying is, the difference between then and now is not only the announcement that was made: Anything to stop Barack Obama. I get that part. But what eventually happened? We were able to get some things done. We were able to work through some things. On the stuff that was really consequential, in terms of ideologically divisive, it was a real fight.But so\u2014but I don't think there's a time when I\u2014I mean, I wonder what would be the Republican platform right now. What do you think? What do you think their position on taxes are? What do you think their position on human rights is? What do you think their position is on whether or not we should\u2014on what we should do about the cost of prescription drugs? What do you think?I mean, I just\u2014I, honest to God, don't know what they're for, yet I know a lot of these Senators and Congressmen, and I know they do have things they want to support, whether they're things I want or not. But you don't hear much about that.And every once in a while, when you hear something where there's a consensus\u2014it's important, but a small item, and it doesn't get much coverage at all where it occurs. I'm not meaning coverage. I mean, there's not much discussion about it.So I just think it's a different\u2014and I don't know that no matter how strongly one supports, as a Republican, and/or supports the President\u2014the former President of the United States\u2014I don't know how we can't look at what happened on January 6 and think: That's a problem.

Well, that\u2014could school reopenings or closures become a potent midterm issue for Republicans to win back the suburbs?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nOh, I think it could be, but I hope to God that they're\u2014that\u2014look, maybe I'm kidding myself, but as time goes on, the voter who is just trying to figure out, as I said, how to take care of their family, put three squares on the table, stay safe, able to pay their mortgage or their rent, et cetera, has\u2014is becoming much more informed on the motives of some of the political players and some of the\u2014and the political parties. And I think that they are not going to be as susceptible to believing some of the outlandish things that have been said and continue to be said.You know, every\u2014every President, not necessarily in the first 12 months, but every President in the first couple of years\u2014almost every President, excuse me, of the last Presidents\u2014at least four of them\u2014have had polling numbers that are 44 percent favorable.So it's this idea that\u2014but you all\u2014not you all\u2014but now it is, Well, Biden is at\u2014one poll showed him at 33 percent. The average is 44\u201444, 45 percent. One poll had him at 49 percent. I mean, the idea that\u2014the American public are trying to sift their way through what's real and what's fake. And I don't think as\u2014I've never seen a time when the political coverage\u2014the choice of what political coverage a voter looks to has as much impact on as what they believe; they go to get reinforced in their views, whether it's MSNBC or whether it's Fox or whatever.I mean\u2014and one of the things I find fascinating that's happening\u2014and you all are dealing with it every day\u2014and it will impact on how things move\u2014is that a lot of the speculation in the polling data shows that the\u2014that the cables are heading south; they're losing viewership. You know? Well, Fox is okay for a while, but it's not gated. And a lot of the rest are predicted to be not very much in the mix in the next 4 to 5 years. I don't know whether that's true or not.But I do know that we have sort of put everybody in\u2014put themselves in certain alleys. And they've decided that, you know, how many people who watch MSNBC also watch Fox, other than a politician trying to find out what's going on in both places? How many people\u2014again, I'm no expert in any of this. But the fact is, I think you have to acknowledge that what gets covered now is necessarily a little bit different than what gets covered in the past.I've had a couple\u2014well, I shouldn't get into this.But the nature not\u2014the nature of the way things get covered\u2014and this is my observation over the years I've been involved in public life\u2014changed. And it's changed because of everything from a thing called the internet. It's changed because of the way in which we have self-identified perspectives based on what channel you turn on, what\u2014what network you look at\u2014not network, but what cable you look at. And it's never quite been like that.Anyway.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nCould school reopenings or closures become a potent midterm issue for Republicans to win back the suburbs?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

We appreciate it. We very much do.So the question I want to ask you gets to accountability, sir, on one of the top public concerns, of course, which is the coronavirus and the Government's response to it.Whether it's confusion over what style of mask to wear, when to test, how to test, where to test\u2014you know, the public is confused, sir, and you see that in the dropoff in the polling on this question.Why did you tell Jeff [Jeff Zeleny, CNN] that you were satisfied with your team? Why are you not willing to make or interested in making any changes, either at the CDC or other agencies, given the fact that the messages have been so confusing?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, the messages, to the extent they've been confusing, is because the scientists\u2014they're learning more. They're learning more about what's needed and what's not needed. And so the fact is that the one piece that has gotten a lot of attention is the communications capacity of the CDC. Well, she came along and said, Look, I'm not a\u2014I mean, I'm a scientist. And I'm learning. I'm learning how to deal with stating what is the case that we've observed.But look, I think that it's a little bit like saying\u2014when we went through the whole issue of how to deal with polio and the polio shots, what was said in the beginning was: Oh, no, it's changed a little bit. We moved this way and that way. Or when we dealt with anything else.I mean, it's\u2014this was a brandnew virus, a brandnew phenomenon. Some of it was deadly, otherwise more communicable. This is this is an unfolding story. It's the nature of the way diseases spread. We're going to learn about it in a lot of other areas, not just COVID-19.And so I think\u2014you know, I look at it this way: Think about how astounding it was within the timeframe that it took to be able to come up with a vaccine. You used to write about that. Pretty amazing how rapidly they came up with a vaccine that saved hundreds of thousands of lives.Did everything get right? No.And by the way, the idea whether we\u2014anyway. I'm talking too much.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhy did you tell Jeff [Jeff Zeleny, CNN] that you were satisfied with your team?

I don't\u2014don't hold me to the number, but somewhere between 20 and 25 Senators and Congresspersons have traveled with me.And I find\u2014you should get the list of them and ask what\u2014how we, you know, sat for the 2, 3, 4, 5 hours that we've flown together\u2014sit back in the\u2014in that conference table and talk to them, ask them questions; they ask me questions.

They want me to be the President and let Senators be Senators.And so, if I've made\u2014and I've made many mistakes, I'm sure.

And then, a follow-up: You mentioned the word inflation there. You recently said you have no short-term answer to bring down gas prices. But, as you know, it's not just gas prices now. Rents are up. The cost of everyday items are up. Inflation in the U.S. is at a 13-year high.So when specifically should Americans expect those prices to come down?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, look, first of all, the significant reason why prices are up is because of COVID affecting the supply chain. I mean, I know you\u2014I'm not trying to be instructive; I know you know this. Number one.Number two, if you take a look at, you know, gas prices and you take a look at oil prices, that is a consequence of, thus far, the refusal of Russia or the OPEC nations to pump more oil.

I think we're going to win in Virginia.And you know\u2014you're reporting it being close\u2014the race is very close. It's about who shows up, who turns out.And granted, I did win by a large margin, but the point of the matter is that I think that this is\u2014this is going to be what we all knew from the beginning: This is going to be a tight race. And it is tight. And it's going to get down to turnout, and it's going to\u2014my guess is that I'm going to be landing at 1 o'clock in the morning, East Coast time. That's probably about the time we'll be hearing what the final results are. I think we're going to win New Jersey as well.But look, you know, the off year is always unpredictable, especially when we don't have a general election going on at the same time.

You mentioned climate activists before, and I want to ask something about them. You're touting agreements. Other world leaders have touted agreements. But the atmosphere around the conference here is skeptical, and it's pretty angry.Climate activists feel like decades and decades of COPs have led to broken promises. And they feel like even if all of these goals are reached that you're talking about in the last few days, it's just not enough right now.And I'm wondering what you would say to the people outside who are really angry at this conference, especially at this moment where Joe Manchin has expressed\u2014you know, has created more doubt that your climate legislation will pass. And you've got a very conservative Supreme Court about to take a look at whether your EPA can regulate greenhouse gas emissions. What's your message to people outside who just worry this all isn't enough right now, given the crisis?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, I think anyone who is focused on the environment should be worried. We've got a lot more to do beyond what we've done. We've done more than we've ever done though; that's the point. And more has to be done.And I don't find\u2014I didn't have a single member of the\u2014this conference come up to me and say: Are you going to pass what you have? And what do you think is\u2014how is that going to affect it? And what are you going to do? What they're looking at is what, in fact, has happened in terms of everything from dealing with deforestation to what we're going to do on Build Back Better and how we've been able to focus now.I mean, when is the last time you heard world leaders sit down together and agree that what they're going to do is, when they deal with the needs of the infrastructure of other countries, that they're going to focus, first and foremost, on whether or not what the climatic\u2014what the climate impact is on that?So I think\u2014look, this is a\u2014there's a reason for people to be worried. I'm worried. I'm worried if we don't continue to move forward and make the kind of progress we're now making, that it's going to\u2014I mean, we\u2014we throw into jeopardy the prospect that we're going to be able to keep the temperature from rising above 1.5 degrees Celsius.But I'm optimistic because I think there's a\u2014how can I say it? I guess maybe the best way to say it to you, Scott, is: What I feel is that the populations of each of our countries have a different perspective than they did at COP25.I think there is\u2014I mean, not because of necessarily any of the leaders of any of our countries, including mine\u2014that all of a sudden, people are seeing these things happening they never thought would happen.They're seeing people drown in their basements in Queens, New York, because of flooding and rain. They're seeing that, you know, more territory burned down in the United States, just since the first of the year, than\u2014it makes up the entire landmass of the State of New Jersey. They've seen a hurricane with a hundred\u2014top winds of 178 miles an hour.I mean\u2014so they're looking at these things. They're seeing more\u2014the waters warming.

You mentioned climate activists before, and I want to ask something about them. You're touting agreements. Other world leaders have touted agreements.

And they feel like even if all of these goals are reached that you're talking about in the last few days, it's just not enough right now.And I'm wondering what you would say to the people outside who are really angry at this conference, especially at this moment where Joe Manchin has expressed\u2014you know, has created more doubt that your climate legislation will pass. And you've got a very conservative Supreme Court about to take a look at whether your EPA can regulate greenhouse gas emissions. What's your message to people outside who just worry this all isn't enough right now, given the crisis?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, I think anyone who is focused on the environment should be worried. We've got a lot more to do beyond what we've done. We've done more than we've ever done though; that's the point. And more has to be done.And I don't find\u2014I didn't have a single member of the\u2014this conference come up to me and say: Are you going to pass what you have? And what do you think is\u2014how is that going to affect it? And what are you going to do? What they're looking at is what, in fact, has happened in terms of everything from dealing with deforestation to what we're going to do on Build Back Better and how we've been able to focus now.I mean, when is the last time you heard world leaders sit down together and agree that what they're going to do is, when they deal with the needs of the infrastructure of other countries, that they're going to focus, first and foremost, on whether or not what the climatic\u2014what the climate impact is on that?So I think\u2014look, this is a\u2014there's a reason for people to be worried. I'm worried. I'm worried if we don't continue to move forward and make the kind of progress we're now making, that it's going to\u2014I mean, we\u2014we throw into jeopardy the prospect that we're going to be able to keep the temperature from rising above 1.5 degrees Celsius.But I'm optimistic because I think there's a\u2014how can I say it? I guess maybe the best way to say it to you, Scott, is: What I feel is that the populations of each of our countries have a different perspective than they did at COP25.I think there is\u2014I mean, not because of necessarily any of the leaders of any of our countries, including mine\u2014that all of a sudden, people are seeing these things happening they never thought would happen.They're seeing people drown in their basements in Queens, New York, because of flooding and rain. They're seeing that, you know, more territory burned down in the United States, just since the first of the year, than\u2014it makes up the entire landmass of the State of New Jersey.

How do you respond to their criticism that the G-20 response is not a good sign for COP26?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI'll answer both questions.Number one, I believe we will pass my Build Back Better plan, and I believe we will pass the infrastructure bill. Combined, they have $900 billion in climate resistance\u2014in dealing with climate and resilience. And it's the largest investment in the history of the world that's ever occurred, and it's going to pass, in my view. But we'll see. We'll see.You know, you've all believed it wouldn't happen from the very beginning, the moment I announced it, and you always seem amazed when it's alive again. Well, you may turn out to be right; maybe it won't work. But I believe we'll see by the end of next week, at home, that it's passed.With regard to the\u2014and by the way, that infrastructure bill delivers an awful lot of things in terms of everything from tax credits for electric vehicles, to making sure we are able to invest, literally, billions of dollars in everything from highways, roads, bridges, public transit, airports, et cetera. But we'll see.The\u2014and with regard to the disappointment: The disappointment relates to the fact that Russia and\u2014and including not only Russia, but China, basically didn't show up in terms of any commitments to deal with climate change. And there's a reason why people should be disappointed in that. I found it disappointing myself.But what we did do\u2014we passed a number of things here to end the subsidization of coal. We made commitments here from across the board, all of us, in terms of what we're going to bring to the G26 [COP26].*And, I think, you know, as that old bad\u2014that old trite saying goes, The proof of the pudding will be in the eating. I think you're going to see we've made significant progress, and more has to be done. But it's going to require us to continue to focus on what China is not doing, what Russia is not doing, and what Saudi Arabia is not doing.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nCan the world and others be confident that you will be able to follow or make good on the promises on climate change that you have made, when you're at Glasgow, without a vote having taken place on your bill?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

One follow-up on energy, sir. You also met with energy consumers about supply. What steps are you considering taking if OPEC Plus does not raise supply? And do you see any irony in pushing them to increase oil production at the same time that you're going to COP26 to urge people to lower emissions?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, on the surface, it seems like an irony, but the truth of the matter is\u2014you've all known; everyone knows\u2014that the idea we're going to be able to move to renewable energy overnight and not have\u2014from this moment on, not use oil or not use gas or not use hydrogen is just not rational.Certain things we can wipe out and we don't have to do. We should be moving immediately to get rid of\u2014as they've adopted here my proposal\u2014to end methane, to deal with a whole range of things.But it does, on the surface, seem inconsistent, but it's not at all inconsistent in that no one has anticipated that this year we'd be in a position\u2014or even next year\u2014that we're not going to use any more oil or gas; that we're not going to be engaged in any fossil fuels. We're going to stop subsidizing those fossil fuels. We're going to be making significant changes.And it just makes the argument that we should move more rapidly to renewable energy: to wind and solar and other means of energy.But the idea that we're just going to end and somehow\u2014but it does, on the surface, I admit to you. We're going to COP to deal with renewable energy, and I'm saying, Why are you guys cutting off oil and raising the price just to make it look harder for us?

One follow-up on energy, sir. You also met with energy consumers about supply. What steps are you considering taking if OPEC Plus does not raise supply? And do you see any irony in pushing them to increase oil production at the same time that you're going to COP26 to urge people to lower emissions?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, on the surface, it seems like an irony, but the truth of the matter is\u2014you've all known; everyone knows\u2014that the idea we're going to be able to move to renewable energy overnight and not have\u2014from this moment on, not use oil or not use gas or not use hydrogen is just not rational.Certain things we can wipe out and we don't have to do. We should be moving immediately to get rid of\u2014as they've adopted here my proposal\u2014to end methane, to deal with a whole range of things.But it does, on the surface, seem inconsistent, but it's not at all inconsistent in that no one has anticipated that this year we'd be in a position\u2014or even next year\u2014that we're not going to use any more oil or gas; that we're not going to be engaged in any fossil fuels. We're going to stop subsidizing those fossil fuels. We're going to be making significant changes.And it just makes the argument that we should move more rapidly to renewable energy: to wind and solar and other means of energy.But the idea that we're just going to end and somehow\u2014but it does, on the surface, I admit to you. We're going to COP to deal with renewable energy, and I'm saying, Why are you guys cutting off oil and raising the price just to make it look harder for us? But it's a legitimate question.I think, though, that if anybody thinks about it, no one ever thought that tomorrow\u2014for example, it's going to take us between now and 2030 to have half the vehicles in America electric vehicles.

Thank you so much. I'd like to actually start by following up on Jeff's question and then ask you about supply chains as a follow-up to that.But, on the question of oil prices, economists say that, you know, when you raise the price of something, people will consume less of it. So why not allow even middle class people around the world to pay more for gasoline in the hope that they would consume fewer fossil fuels and emit less?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, because they have to get to their work. They have to get in an automobile, turn on the key, get their kids to school. The school buses have to run. That's the reason why. You know that, Jim. That's the reason.The idea that we can\u2014that there's an alternative to walk away from being able to get in your automobile is just not realistic; it's not going to happen. And this wasn't intended to happen.And by the way, when the cost of a gallon of gasoline gets to above three hundred and thirty\u2014three hundred\u2014$3.35 a gallon, it has profound impact on working class families just to get back and forth to work. So I don't see anything inconsistent with that.But I do think that the idea that Russia and Saudi Arabia and other major producers are not going to pump more oil so people can have gasoline to get to and from work, for example, is\u2014is not right. But\u2014and what we're considering doing on that, I'm reluctant to say before I have to do it.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhy not allow even middle class people around the world to pay more for gasoline in the hope that they would consume fewer fossil fuels and emit less?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

And then on supply chain, sir: One of the, obviously, big problems in the United States for supply chains is not having enough workers, not enough people to drive trucks to unload at ports, for example, and a lot of other parts in the supply chain. Workers have not returned to the labor force in America as fast as your administration thought they would. Why do you think that is? Why aren't people coming back to work?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nBecause they're able to negotiate for higher wages, and they move from one job to another. That's one of the reasons why. A lot of people don't want to continue to do the job they did before, making 7, 8, 9 bucks an hour. An awful lot of the auto\u2014excuse me, of the truck drivers are not unionized truck drivers. They're working like hell and not getting paid a whole lot.And so what you're seeing here is a combination of the desire of people to be able to change professions, to be able to do more and take care of their families, and at the same time, dealing with the issue that, in fact, we are short of workers.But worker pay has actually gone up. And we've employed 6 million people just since I got elected. So employment is up. The economy is actually, in spite of all this, still growing. You have the significant number of\u2014I forget the number; I think it was close to six\u201416 major economists acknowledging that what's going to happen is, you're going to see continued economic growth under our proposals.

So many pieces on the table are moving. And how they get resettled depends upon the judgments we make and whether or not the United States, among others, can lead the world in a direction that's going to increase the circumstances for a higher standard of living for workers here and abroad, as well as making sure that people have an opportunity. As I said\u2014again, I use the phrase\u2014just have a little breathing room.I meant what I said when I ran. My desire was to build this economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. And that's what's in process of happening.But in the meantime, there's been enormous changes as a consequence of COVID on the supply chains, because why are we having trouble? An awful lot of the very factories and\u2014and operations that, in fact, produced material that we need for supply chains, in everything from shoes to dealing with computer chips, you know, they're out sick; they're not working.And so it's changing.

And the masks are making my glasses fog up, so I apologize too.Thank you, sir. On climate change: You just mentioned the incentives you have on renewable energy in your Build Back Better plan. You do have a number of incentives, but as it stands right now, there are no punitive measures in this plan to hold these companies accountable. And many experts firmly believe that you've got to have the stick along with the carrot in order to get to your goal to reduce emissions by 2030 by 50 percent. So can you stand here today and say to the world that you definitively will still meet that goal?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes, I can. Because what we're proposing and what we've initiated is everything from getting the automobile makers to commit to going all electric, number one. Getting the unions to agree to do that as well. Making sure we have the investment in battery technology that requires us to have the ability to generate electric vehicles, electric buses, electric transportation grids. Making sure that we are dealing with everything from\u2014let me go through some of these: that we have tax credits for\u2014of $320 billion for dealing with alternatives by people getting a tax credit for moving on solar panels, on wind, and a whole range of other things, and winterizing their properties.I don't think you're going to need any punitive action to get people to step up and do those things. There's been no indication that's the case at all. With regard to, you know, the\u2014there's a total of $555 billion in climate and\u2014I'm just checking the numbers; make sure I'm right\u2014and climate investment, in terms of resilience.We're now\u2014it's very much in the interest of\u2014of the industry to see to it that we move to making sure that we have the resilience to be able to, when those towers come down and the lines end up hitting the ground and burning down large swaths of the West, to bury this underground.There's a whole range of things.

And a follow-up, sir, if I may. On your meeting with Pope Francis: The more than 50 million Catholics back at home are seeing something play out that has never happened before: this split in the conservative wing of the Catholic Church moving to deny someone like you, a Catholic President, the sacrament of Communion.What\u2014for these Catholics back home, what did it mean for you to hear Pope Francis, in the wake of this\u2014in the middle of this debate, call you a good Catholic? And did what he tell you\u2014should that put this debate to rest?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nLook, I'm not going to\u2014a lot of this is just personal. has become a\u2014I don't want to exaggerate\u2014has become a\u2014someone who has provided great solace for my family when my son died.He has\u2014he is, in my view\u2014there's always been this debate in the Catholic Church, going back to Pope John XXIII, that talk about how we reach out and embrace people with differences.If you notice what the Pope said when he was asked when he first got elected Pope\u2014he was traveling with the press, and they said, What's your position on homosexuals? He said, Who am I to judge?This is a man who is of great empathy. He is a man who understands that part of his Christianity is to reach out and to forgive. And so I just find my relationship with him one that I personally take great solace in. He is a really, truly genuine, decent man.And I'll end by saying that, you know, there were an awful lot of people who\u2014and many of you\u2014I'm not putting you in this position; I apologize\u2014but many of you who are even in the press who went out of your way to express your empathy and sympathy when I lost the real part of my soul, when I\u2014when my\u2014when I lost my Beau, my son.And I\u2014my family will never forget\u2014my extended family. Because when I had come\u2014it was only a matter of days since my son had passed away, and came to the United States to visit with the\u2014with not only President Obama, but with the Catholic Church here. And I was asked if I would accompany him to Philadelphia, to the seminary, and\u2014anyway.And I did, but it was\u2014the wounds were still raw of the loss of my son. And I had my extended family\u2014and you're all tired of seeing my extended family; they're always around\u2014my grandchildren, my children, my wife, my daughters-in-law.And before he left and got on the plane, the Pope asked whether or not he could meet with my family. And we met in a hangar in\u2014at the Philadelphia Airport. And he came in, and he talked to my family for a considerable amount of time\u201410, 15 minutes\u2014about my son Beau.And he didn't just generically talk about him; he knew about him. He knew what he did. He knew who he was. He knew where he went to school. He knew what he knew what a man he was. And it had such a cathartic impact on his children and my wife and our family that it\u2014it meant a great deal.And as\u2014I meant what I said\u2014everybody was laughing; I didn't realize you all were able to film what I was doing with the Pope when I gave him a command coin. And I meant what I said: I\u2014this is a man who is someone who is looking to establish peace and decency and honor, not just in the Catholic Church, but just generically.When I won, he called me to tell me how much he appreciated the fact that I would focus on the poor and focus on the needs of people who were in trouble. And so I just\u2014again, I don't want to talk more about it, because so much of it is personal, but I'm\u2014he is everything I learned about Catholicism from the time I was a kid going from grade school through high school.And I have great respect for people who have other religious views, but he is\u2014he's just a fine, decent, honorable man.

Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions for you and then some for Chancellor Merkel as well. Your administration, tomorrow, is issuing a business advisory for Hong Kong. I was wondering if you can explain why you think that is necessary.And then, secondly, on your Build Back Better agenda, have you spoken to Senators Manchin and Sinema about the $3.5 trillion framework, and are you confident that they'll be on board at that level? And if they demand that you lose some components, will you be able to keep progressives on board?[At this point, the reporter spoke in German, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]I wanted to ask you whether you have a feeling that, after the talk with President Biden, he better understands your viewpoint as regards China or whether the situation is still tense, whether there is still decoupling. And secondly, whether you think that the United States has contributed enough to vaccinate the rest of the world, or do you think it's only\u2014is it appropriate for children in the United States being vaccinated\u2014children below the age of 12, while adults in other countries have no chance to get vaccinated?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThat's all? [] I thought I said we'd take two questions, but I guess that translated to, we'd take two questions or more from each person called on.Let me talk about the business advisory. The situation in Hong Kong is deteriorating. And the Chinese Government is not keeping its commitment that it made how it would deal with Hong Kong. And so it is more of an advisory as to what may happen in\u2014on Hong Kong. It's as simple as that and as complicated as that.With regard to am I confident?\u2014I'm supremely confident that everything is going to work out perfectly in terms\u2014[]. Look, I understand why the press, among others, is skeptical that I can actually get this deal done on infrastructure and on human infrastructure. And I've watched and listened, and the press declared my initiative dead at least 10 times so far.I don't think it's dead. I think it's still alive. I still have confidence we're going to be able to get what I proposed and what I've agreed to in the bipartisan agreement on infrastructure. I've gotten\u2014we've each committed\u2014I trust the members of\u2014the Republican Senators who have made the commitments relative to how we should proceed and what would be included in the package for infrastructure. And they're men and women of honor, and I expect they would keep their commitment.With regard to the further issue of what's going on and what will confuse the listening audience\u2014but reconciliation\u2014that is the mechanism by which you have to get every single Democrat to agree to proceed on matters like what I announced today.Today\u2014I don't know whether you have any children; it's none of my business whether you do, but if you do, you're going to get\u2014if you're making less than $150,000\u2014you're going to get a significant stipend that is a tax cut. If you have a child under the age of 7 years old, you're going to get\u2014in your bank account today, you're going to get a payment of one-sixth\u201412 months divided\u2014$3,600\u2014$3,700 for that child divided by 12 every month, just like a Social Security check. It's expected to reduce poverty\u2014child poverty by over 40 percent. And it could be a significant, significant game changer.We have mechanisms to pay for both these mechanisms. And there may be some last-minute discussion as to who\u2014what mechanism is used to pay for each of these items, both the infrastructure package and the human infrastructure package. But I believe we will get it done.Thank you. We talked about China, and there is a lot of common understanding that China, in many areas, is our competitor; that trade with China needs to rest on the assumption that we have a level playing field so that we all play by the same rules, have the same standards. That, incidentally, was also the driving force behind the EU-China agreement on trade that they abide by the core labor norms of ILO.And we are convinced of ours\u2014needing to be technological leaders for our two countries in many, many areas. Obviously, it's legitimate for China wishing to do this as well, but, forexample, we will cooperate in many technological state-of-the-art technologies, for example, CHIPS. I think the act that the President launched is fundamental in this respect and crucial.And we want to trade together at a time of digitalization where security issues loom very large in our agendas. We ought to have an exchange on this; we ought to talk about this; we ought to talk about norms, standards that govern the internet; whether we can agree on common norms. I think, particularly as regards to the relationship of us with China, we ought to coordinate our efforts. We do that in the European Union, and we should do it with the United States.And then, there are interests, obviously: sometimes divergent interests, but sometimes common interests. But we also have, obviously, areas where American companies compete with European companies, and we have to accept that. But I think, basically, the rules as to how we deal with China ought to rest and do rest on our shared values.And I think, on the pandemic, we are obviously of the opinion that the pandemic\u2014we can only master the pandemic if each and every one is vaccinated. We are trying to boost production. We are trying also to get as many people in our country vaccinated as possible\u2014which obviously opens us up to criticism of those countries who as yet have not had the chance, which is why we invested a lot of money in COVAX, which is why we encourage our companies to increase their production of vaccines.And, in Africa, we are trying to help Africans to upskill people so that they, too, can have their own production sites. We're going to do this, but, de facto, there is an imbalance, I agree. And\u2014but we're overcoming. We're putting our all into that and also together in overcoming that imbalance.I'm sorry.

I was wondering if you can explain why you think that is necessary.And then, secondly, on your Build Back Better agenda, have you spoken to Senators Manchin and Sinema about the $3.5 trillion framework, and are you confident that they'll be on board at that level? And if they demand that you lose some components, will you be able to keep progressives on board?[At this point, the reporter spoke in German, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]I wanted to ask you whether you have a feeling that, after the talk with President Biden, he better understands your viewpoint as regards China or whether the situation is still tense, whether there is still decoupling. And secondly, whether you think that the United States has contributed enough to vaccinate the rest of the world, or do you think it's only\u2014is it appropriate for children in the United States being vaccinated\u2014children below the age of 12, while adults in other countries have no chance to get vaccinated?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThat's all? [] I thought I said we'd take two questions, but I guess that translated to, we'd take two questions or more from each person called on.Let me talk about the business advisory. The situation in Hong Kong is deteriorating. And the Chinese Government is not keeping its commitment that it made how it would deal with Hong Kong. And so it is more of an advisory as to what may happen in\u2014on Hong Kong. It's as simple as that and as complicated as that.With regard to am I confident?\u2014I'm supremely confident that everything is going to work out perfectly in terms\u2014[]. Look, I understand why the press, among others, is skeptical that I can actually get this deal done on infrastructure and on human infrastructure. And I've watched and listened, and the press declared my initiative dead at least 10 times so far.I don't think it's dead. I think it's still alive. I still have confidence we're going to be able to get what I proposed and what I've agreed to in the bipartisan agreement on infrastructure. I've gotten\u2014we've each committed\u2014I trust the members of\u2014the Republican Senators who have made the commitments relative to how we should proceed and what would be included in the package for infrastructure. And they're men and women of honor, and I expect they would keep their commitment.With regard to the further issue of what's going on and what will confuse the listening audience\u2014but reconciliation\u2014that is the mechanism by which you have to get every single Democrat to agree to proceed on matters like what I announced today.Today\u2014I don't know whether you have any children; it's none of my business whether you do, but if you do, you're going to get\u2014if you're making less than $150,000\u2014you're going to get a significant stipend that is a tax cut. If you have a child under the age of 7 years old, you're going to get\u2014in your bank account today, you're going to get a payment of one-sixth\u201412 months divided\u2014$3,600\u2014$3,700 for that child divided by 12 every month, just like a Social Security check. It's expected to reduce poverty\u2014child poverty by over 40 percent. And it could be a significant, significant game changer.We have mechanisms to pay for both these mechanisms. And there may be some last-minute discussion as to who\u2014what mechanism is used to pay for each of these items, both the infrastructure package and the human infrastructure package. But I believe we will get it done.Thank you. We talked about China, and there is a lot of common understanding that China, in many areas, is our competitor; that trade with China needs to rest on the assumption that we have a level playing field so that we all play by the same rules, have the same standards. That, incidentally, was also the driving force behind the EU-China agreement on trade that they abide by the core labor norms of ILO.And we are convinced of ours\u2014needing to be technological leaders for our two countries in many, many areas. Obviously, it's legitimate for China wishing to do this as well, but, forexample, we will cooperate in many technological state-of-the-art technologies, for example, CHIPS. I think the act that the President launched is fundamental in this respect and crucial.And we want to trade together at a time of digitalization where security issues loom very large in our agendas. We ought to have an exchange on this; we ought to talk about this; we ought to talk about norms, standards that govern the internet; whether we can agree on common norms. I think, particularly as regards to the relationship of us with China, we ought to coordinate our efforts. We do that in the European Union, and we should do it with the United States.And then, there are interests, obviously: sometimes divergent interests, but sometimes common interests. But we also have, obviously, areas where American companies compete with European companies, and we have to accept that. But I think, basically, the rules as to how we deal with China ought to rest and do rest on our shared values.And I think, on the pandemic, we are obviously of the opinion that the pandemic\u2014we can only master the pandemic if each and every one is vaccinated. We are trying to boost production. We are trying also to get as many people in our country vaccinated as possible\u2014which obviously opens us up to criticism of those countries who as yet have not had the chance, which is why we invested a lot of money in COVAX, which is why we encourage our companies to increase their production of vaccines.And, in Africa, we are trying to help Africans to upskill people so that they, too, can have their own production sites. We're going to do this, but, de facto, there is an imbalance, I agree. And\u2014but we're overcoming. We're putting our all into that and also together in overcoming that imbalance.I'm sorry. I call on Ms. Sch\u00e4uble from Der Tagesspiegel newspaper. Thank you.[]\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nRegarding the points asked in the German reporter's question\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Very short one for each of you. Mr. President, my question\u2014my first question touches an issue that worries a lot of people in the U.S. and in Germany.

What is the main argument for not lifting that travel ban for the Schengen region?And, Chancellor Merkel\u2014\u2014[The reporter spoke in German, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]You talked to the business companies here.

I said: Because he's in violation of an international norm. It's called a Chemical Weapons Treaty. Can't be trusted. It's about trust. It's about their ability to influence other nations in a positive way.Look, would you like to trade our economy for 's economy? Would you like to trade? And by the way, we talked about trade. I don't have any problem with doing business with , as long as they do it based upon international norms. It's in our interest to see the n people do well economically. I don't have a problem with that.But if they do not act according to international norms, then guess what? That will not\u2014that only won't it happen with us, it will not happen with other nations.

They won't as long as they are convinced that, in fact, the violations\u2014for example, the American businessman who was in house arrest.

It's the way human nature functions.And understand, when you run a country that does not abide by international norms, and yet you need those international norms to be somehow managed so that you can participate in the benefits that flow from them, it hurts you.
