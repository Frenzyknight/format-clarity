You mentioned that Americans are frustrated. And, in fact, 75 percent of voters say the country is heading in the wrong direction, despite the results of last night. What in the next 2 years do you intend to do differently to change people's opinion of the direction of the country, particularly as you contemplate a run for President in 2024?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNothing, because they're just finding out what we're doing. The more they know about what we're doing, the more support there is.Do you know anybody who wants us to get rid of the change we made on prescription drug prices and raise prices again? Do you know anybody who wants us to walk away from building those roads and bridges and the internet and so on? I don't know any\u2014I think that the problem is, the major pieces of legislation we passed\u2014and some of it bipartisan\u2014takes time to be recognized.For example, you've got over a trillion dollars' worth of infrastructure money, but not that many spades have been put in the ground. It's taking time. For example, I was on the phone congratulating a Californian recently and then someone in\u2014up in Scranton, Pennsylvania\u2014the Congressman who got elected. And he said, Can you help us make sure we're able to have high-speed rail service from Scranton to New York\u2014New York City? I said: Yes, we can. We can.First of all, it will make it a lot easier, take a lot of vehicles off the road. And we have more money in the pot now already out there\u2014we voted for\u2014than the entire money we spent on Amtrak to begin with.And it's the same way\u2014for example, I talked about, through the campaign, that we're going to limit the cost of insulin for seniors to $35 a month instead of $400 a month. Well, it doesn't take effect until next year.So there's a lot of things that are just starting to kick in. And the same way with what we've done in terms of environmental stuff. It takes time to get it moving.So I'm not going to change\u2014as a matter of fact, you know there's some things I wanted to change and add to. For example, we've\u2014had passed the most bipartisan, we passed the most extensive gun legislation\u2014you know, rational gun policy in 30 years. And\u2014but we didn't ban assault weapons. I'm going to ban assault weapons. They're going to try like the devil\u2014so I'm not going to change the direction.I said I ran for three reasons. I'm going to continue to stay where I'm\u2014and I know\u2014I fully understand the legitimate concern that what I'm saying is wrong. Okay?One is that I said we're going to restore the soul of the country, begin to treat each other with decency, honor, and integrity. And it's starting to happen. People are starting\u2014the conversations are becoming more normal, becoming more\u2014more\u2014how can I say it?\u2014decent.Second thing I said was, I want to build a country from the middle out and the bottom up. And that way, everybody does fine. I'm tired of trickle-down. Not a whole lot trickles down when you trickle down to hard-working folks.And the third thing\u2014I know is still very hard\u2014I'm going to do everything in my power to see through that we unite the country. It's hard to sustain yourself as a leading democracy in the world if you can't generate some unity.So I'm not going to change anything in any fundamental way.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat in the next 2 years do you intend to do differently to change people's opinion of the direction of the country, particularly as you contemplate a run for President in 2024?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Both countries have spoken about the challenge of climate change. But there is a view that ambitious targets are set, but implementation is found often lacking. And there is also a criticism of lack of technological transfer, financial transfer from the developed countries to the developing nations.How do you both leaders see the way ahead on this pressing issue?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, I think it is the existential threat to humanity: climate change. It's the most serious problem we face as human beings. We have to keep it below 1.5 degrees Celsius. We've made enormous progress here in the United States on dealing with this issue by doing three things.Number one, by insisting that we move our\u2014every one of our industries into a position where they can take advantage of cheaper and more extensive and more available renewable energy, whether it's solar or wind or hydrogen and green hydrogen. There's a whole range of things we've been working on.In addition to that, we find ourselves in a position that\u2014what we've done is that we have significantly reduced the\u2014for example, I made a commitment that we are going to make sure that by 2030, 30 percent of all our land and sea and oceans were\u2014are\u2014were in conservation, could not be developed. We're well on our way to doing that. And that's also absorbing carbon from the air as a consequence of that, because of the conservation.We are in a position, as well, by\u2014we have provided for significant increase in funding for a whole range of issues, but not just for the United States, but for the rest of the world.For example, we're working with the G-7 to provide for infrastructure work for dealing with global warming on the continent of Africa: in Angola, building the largest solar project; moving ourselves\u2014having railway to go all the way across the southern two-thirds\u2014the\u2014from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean, in Africa, to be able to transport and do it cheaper and do it with less\u2014how can I say it?\u2014less carbon emissions.We're trying to work with other countries to maintain their carbon sinks so they don't have to develop them like we did and causing pollution. And we're trying to figure out how to work out to pay them not to develop certain areas, like the Amazon in Brazil.But there's a lot of technology that's available that we're sharing, and we share with one another. We've learned how to do solar energy, which is considerably cheaper than it is to\u2014for fuel\u2014for fossil fuels. The same way dealing with not just solar, but dealing with wind.And so there's a lot of the technology that we've developed. And we're well on our way, I think, to meeting the commitment we made to\u2014that we made in Paris. And I\u2014and we're prepared to share all of that with India, that has a desire to do the same. Excellency, you said very rightly that, as far as India is concerned, the environment, climate, these are extremely important in our cultural traditions. For us, the environment is an article of faith. This is not just something that we need to do for convenience; we believe this.We do not believe in the exploitation of nature. In order for all of creation to work, we can make nature\u2014but we cannot have exploitation of nature, and we have always believed this.And on the basis of these values, we are not only doing things for ourselves, but are taking some global initiatives, as well. You perhaps know that the G-20 countries, the promises they made in Paris, of all the G-20 countries, India is the only country that has fulfilled all the promises it made at the G-20.Not just that, in the area of solar energy, in Glasgow, we had set ourselves a target to achieve 500 gigawatts of renewable energy. By 2030, we have set ourselves a target to make Indian railways net zero.And you must understand the scale of Indian railways. When we talk about Indian railways, it means that every day the entire population of Australia travels in our wagons\u2014in our railway wagons, on our trains. And we have set ourselves a target to achieve net zero for our railways.We have also set ourselves targets for solar energy, for ethanol\u201410 percent mix of ethanol. We have completed this target before the set date.We are also working in the area of green hydrogen. We want India to be a green hydrogen hub, and we are working towards this.In\u2014and the International Solar Alliance has been launched by India, and many countries have joined it and are working with India. The island countries, we have helped them in the area of solar energy so that they have now got a new confidence that we are with them in their efforts to fight climate change. And we will not only fulfill our responsibilities, but we will also help you in the area of climate change.We have seen that due to natural calamities\u2014people talk about the death of people, no doubt, when there are natural disasters, but there is a lot of destruction of infrastructure as well.And therefore, because of climate change, the kind of crisis we are feeling, we need to develop infrastructure that is resilient. And therefore, we have created a global organization called CDRI. And you perhaps know that in Glasgow I presented a subject to the world. And recently, it was launched by the U.N. Secretary General and myself. That is Mission LiFE. And when I say LiFE, I mean Lifestyle for the Environment. Therefore, every individual must live his life in a pro-environment, pro-development way. And we are working towards this.And I am sure that whatever work India has started in all these areas\u2014not because India has adversely affected the environment of the world; we are doing this because we have a concern for future generations. We do not want to give our future generations a world that make life difficult for them.And therefore, as a global responsibility, India has not caused any problems to the environment. However, we are playing a leading role in contributing in a positive manner.As far as prosperous countries are concerned, there's always been talk about technology transfer, financial support, and there are some countries that need to have technology transfer, financial support. And we hope that as soon as we can move forward in this area, we will be able to solve this challenge of climate change. Thank you very much. Let me add one thing.

Both countries have spoken about the challenge of climate change. But there is a view that ambitious targets are set, but implementation is found often lacking. And there is also a criticism of lack of technological transfer, financial transfer from the developed countries to the developing nations.How do you both leaders see the way ahead on this pressing issue?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, I think it is the existential threat to humanity: climate change. It's the most serious problem we face as human beings. We have to keep it below 1.5 degrees Celsius. We've made enormous progress here in the United States on dealing with this issue by doing three things.Number one, by insisting that we move our\u2014every one of our industries into a position where they can take advantage of cheaper and more extensive and more available renewable energy, whether it's solar or wind or hydrogen and green hydrogen. There's a whole range of things we've been working on.In addition to that, we find ourselves in a position that\u2014what we've done is that we have significantly reduced the\u2014for example, I made a commitment that we are going to make sure that by 2030, 30 percent of all our land and sea and oceans were\u2014are\u2014were in conservation, could not be developed. We're well on our way to doing that. And that's also absorbing carbon from the air as a consequence of that, because of the conservation.We are in a position, as well, by\u2014we have provided for significant increase in funding for a whole range of issues, but not just for the United States, but for the rest of the world.For example, we're working with the G-7 to provide for infrastructure work for dealing with global warming on the continent of Africa: in Angola, building the largest solar project; moving ourselves\u2014having railway to go all the way across the southern two-thirds\u2014the\u2014from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean, in Africa, to be able to transport and do it cheaper and do it with less\u2014how can I say it?\u2014less carbon emissions.We're trying to work with other countries to maintain their carbon sinks so they don't have to develop them like we did and causing pollution. And we're trying to figure out how to work out to pay them not to develop certain areas, like the Amazon in Brazil.But there's a lot of technology that's available that we're sharing, and we share with one another. We've learned how to do solar energy, which is considerably cheaper than it is to\u2014for fuel\u2014for fossil fuels. The same way dealing with not just solar, but dealing with wind.And so there's a lot of the technology that we've developed. And we're well on our way, I think, to meeting the commitment we made to\u2014that we made in Paris. And I\u2014and we're prepared to share all of that with India, that has a desire to do the same. Excellency, you said very rightly that, as far as India is concerned, the environment, climate, these are extremely important in our cultural traditions. For us, the environment is an article of faith. This is not just something that we need to do for convenience; we believe this.We do not believe in the exploitation of nature. In order for all of creation to work, we can make nature\u2014but we cannot have exploitation of nature, and we have always believed this.And on the basis of these values, we are not only doing things for ourselves, but are taking some global initiatives, as well. You perhaps know that the G-20 countries, the promises they made in Paris, of all the G-20 countries, India is the only country that has fulfilled all the promises it made at the G-20.Not just that, in the area of solar energy, in Glasgow, we had set ourselves a target to achieve 500 gigawatts of renewable energy. By 2030, we have set ourselves a target to make Indian railways net zero.And you must understand the scale of Indian railways. When we talk about Indian railways, it means that every day the entire population of Australia travels in our wagons\u2014in our railway wagons, on our trains. And we have set ourselves a target to achieve net zero for our railways.We have also set ourselves targets for solar energy, for ethanol\u201410 percent mix of ethanol. We have completed this target before the set date.We are also working in the area of green hydrogen. We want India to be a green hydrogen hub, and we are working towards this.In\u2014and the International Solar Alliance has been launched by India, and many countries have joined it and are working with India. The island countries, we have helped them in the area of solar energy so that they have now got a new confidence that we are with them in their efforts to fight climate change. And we will not only fulfill our responsibilities, but we will also help you in the area of climate change.We have seen that due to natural calamities\u2014people talk about the death of people, no doubt, when there are natural disasters, but there is a lot of destruction of infrastructure as well.And therefore, because of climate change, the kind of crisis we are feeling, we need to develop infrastructure that is resilient. And therefore, we have created a global organization called CDRI. And you perhaps know that in Glasgow I presented a subject to the world. And recently, it was launched by the U.N. Secretary General and myself. That is Mission LiFE. And when I say LiFE, I mean Lifestyle for the Environment. Therefore, every individual must live his life in a pro-environment, pro-development way. And we are working towards this.And I am sure that whatever work India has started in all these areas\u2014not because India has adversely affected the environment of the world; we are doing this because we have a concern for future generations. We do not want to give our future generations a world that make life difficult for them.And therefore, as a global responsibility, India has not caused any problems to the environment. However, we are playing a leading role in contributing in a positive manner.As far as prosperous countries are concerned, there's always been talk about technology transfer, financial support, and there are some countries that need to have technology transfer, financial support. And we hope that as soon as we can move forward in this area, we will be able to solve this challenge of climate change. Thank you very much. Let me add one thing. We have caused damage in the United States the way we developed over the last 300 years. And that's why I was able to convince my colleagues in the Congress to pass legislation\u2014the largest climate fund ever in American\u2014in the world history: $369 billion\u2014$369 billion\u2014to deal with the climate crisis.And we are doing it extensively now, and I think you're going to see significant progress.Thank you all very, very much.[]\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAsking both leaders about their views on the way ahead on the issue of climate change.\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

And so I don't get any sense that there's more or less confrontation.We were very blunt with one another about places where we disagreed or where we were uncertain of each other's position. And we agreed we'd set up\u2014and we did\u2014mechanisms whereby we would meet in detail with our\u2014the key people in each of our administrations to discuss how we could resolve them, or how, if they weren't resolved, on what basis were they not resolved.Sebastian Smith, the AFP.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nElaborate on the President's demeanor and communication style.\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

A quick question on North Korea, which appears poised to conduct a new nuclear test. I'm wondering if you can talk about your specific discussions with President Xi on that.To what extent do you think China has the ability to talk North Korea out of conducting such tests? And what are the repercussions for U.S.-Chinese relations if a test goes forward?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, it's difficult to say that I am certain that China can control North Korea, number one.Number two, I've made it clear to President Xi Jinping that I thought they had an obligation to attempt to make it clear to North Korea that they should not engage in long-range nuclear tests. And I made it clear as well that if they did\u2014they meaning North Korea\u2014that we would have to take certain actions that would be more defensive on our behalf, and it would not be directed against North Korea\u2014I mean, excuse me\u2014it would not be directed against China, but it would be to send a clear message to North Korea. We are going to defend our allies, as well as American soil and American capacity.And so\u2014but I do not think that\u2014it's difficult to determine whether or not China has the capacity. I'm confident China is not looking for North Korea to engage in further escalatory means. Because I made it clear\u2014and I made it clear from the very beginning, and last year as well, that we will do what it needs to defend our capacity, to defend ourselves and our allies\u2014South Korea, as well as Japan\u2014and that it would be\u2014we'd be more up in the face of China. But it wouldn't be because of China, it'd be because of what was going on in North Korea.So\u2014and again, on a number of these issues, we have put together teams where our National Security Adviser, Secretary of Defense, and others are going to be engaging with their counterparts in China to see\u2014and we're not going to be able to work everything out. I'm not suggesting it's going\u2014this is kumbaya, you know, everybody is going go away with everything in agreement. But I do not believe that there's a need for concern of a, as one of you raised the legitimate question, a new cold war.And I think that\u2014I'll conclude by saying it this way: I want to be clear\u2014and be clear with all leaders, but particularly with Xi Jinping\u2014that I mean what I say and I say what I mean, so there's no misunderstanding. That's the biggest concern is\u2014I have is a misunderstanding about intentions or actions on each of our parts.So we went in to\u2014I'll look at my team\u2014how long did that meeting last?

A quick question on North Korea, which appears poised to conduct a new nuclear test. I'm wondering if you can talk about your specific discussions with President Xi on that.To what extent do you think China has the ability to talk North Korea out of conducting such tests? And what are the repercussions for U.S.-Chinese relations if a test goes forward?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, it's difficult to say that I am certain that China can control North Korea, number one.Number two, I've made it clear to President Xi Jinping that I thought they had an obligation to attempt to make it clear to North Korea that they should not engage in long-range nuclear tests. And I made it clear as well that if they did\u2014they meaning North Korea\u2014that we would have to take certain actions that would be more defensive on our behalf, and it would not be directed against North Korea\u2014I mean, excuse me\u2014it would not be directed against China, but it would be to send a clear message to North Korea. We are going to defend our allies, as well as American soil and American capacity.And so\u2014but I do not think that\u2014it's difficult to determine whether or not China has the capacity. I'm confident China is not looking for North Korea to engage in further escalatory means. Because I made it clear\u2014and I made it clear from the very beginning, and last year as well, that we will do what it needs to defend our capacity, to defend ourselves and our allies\u2014South Korea, as well as Japan\u2014and that it would be\u2014we'd be more up in the face of China. But it wouldn't be because of China, it'd be because of what was going on in North Korea.So\u2014and again, on a number of these issues, we have put together teams where our National Security Adviser, Secretary of Defense, and others are going to be engaging with their counterparts in China to see\u2014and we're not going to be able to work everything out. I'm not suggesting it's going\u2014this is kumbaya, you know, everybody is going go away with everything in agreement. But I do not believe that there's a need for concern of a, as one of you raised the legitimate question, a new cold war.And I think that\u2014I'll conclude by saying it this way: I want to be clear\u2014and be clear with all leaders, but particularly with Xi Jinping\u2014that I mean what I say and I say what I mean, so there's no misunderstanding. That's the biggest concern is\u2014I have is a misunderstanding about intentions or actions on each of our parts.So we went in to\u2014I'll look at my team\u2014how long did that meeting last? Three and a half hours. The President. Three and a half hours. So we covered an awful lot of territory. And I must say that he was as straightforward as he has been with me in the past. And I think that we understand one another, which is the most important thing that can be done.I guess all of you are going swimming from here. It's not far.

You know, impeachment proceedings against Biden\u2014I mean, I think the American people will look at all of that for what it is. It's just almost comedy.

So I think the\u2014one way to follow up on that is you noted that you felt like there was a shift in terms of people being willing to show more decency in this moment. You've often talked about breaking the fever or kind of a transition from this moment that we faced over the last several years. Do you feel like the election is what represents that? Do you feel like the fever has broken, I guess?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I'm not\u2014I don't think we're going to break the fever for the super-mega-MAGA Republicans. I mean\u2014but I think they're a minority of the Republican Party. I think the vast majority of the members of the Republican Party, we disagree strongly on issues, but they're decent, honorable people. We have differences of agreement on issues.But they\u2014you know, I worked with a lot of these folks in the Senate and the House for a long time. And you know, they're honest, and they're straightforward. They're different than mine, but they're\u2014you know, they're decent folks.And so I think that the rest of the world\u2014and a lot of you have covered other parts of the world, and you know\u2014the rest of the world is looking at the United States. I guess the best way to say this is to repeat what you've\u2014some of you've heard me say before.The first G-7 meeting\u2014for the public, that's the seven largest democracies\u2014when I went to\u2014right after we got elected, in February, after I got sworn in in January. And I sat down at a table\u2014a roundtable with the six other world leaders from the European Union, the United\u2014and Canada, et cetera, and said, America is back. And one of them turned to me and said: For how long? For how long? It was a deadly earnest question: For how long?And I looked at them. And then another one went on to say\u2014and I'm not going to name them\u2014went on to say, What would you say, Joe, if in fact you went\u2014we went to bed tonight here in England, woke up the next morning and found out that thousands of people had stormed the Parliament of Great Britain\u2014gone down the hall, broken down the doors, two cops ended up dying, a number of people injured, and they tried to stop the confirmation of an election? It's not the same situation, obviously, as we have. And he said, What would you think?And what\u2014I ask the rhetorical question: What would you all think? You'd think England was really in trouble. You'd think democracy was on the edge if that happened in Great Britain. And so that's the way people were looking at us, like, When is this going to stop? Nothing like this has happened since the Civil War. I don't want to exaggerate. But literally, nothing like this has happened since the Civil War.And so what I find is that they want to know: Is the United States stable? Do we know what we're about? Are we the same democracy we've always been? Because, look, the rest of the world looks to us\u2014I don't mean that we're always\u2014like we're always right. But if the United States tomorrow were to, quote, withdraw from the world, a lot of things would change around the world. A whole lot would change.And so they're very concerned that we are still the open democracy we've been and that we have rules and the institutions matter. And that's the context in which I think that they're looking at: Are we back to a place where we are going to accept decisions made by the Court, by the Congress, by the Government, et cetera?\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo you feel like the fever has broken?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

I guess the best way to say this is to repeat what you've\u2014some of you've heard me say before.The first G-7 meeting\u2014for the public, that's the seven largest democracies\u2014when I went to\u2014right after we got elected, in February, after I got sworn in in January. And I sat down at a table\u2014a roundtable with the six other world leaders from the European Union, the United\u2014and Canada, et cetera, and said, America is back. And one of them turned to me and said: For how long? For how long? It was a deadly earnest question: For how long?And I looked at them. And then another one went on to say\u2014and I'm not going to name them\u2014went on to say, What would you say, Joe, if in fact you went\u2014we went to bed tonight here in England, woke up the next morning and found out that thousands of people had stormed the Parliament of Great Britain\u2014gone down the hall, broken down the doors, two cops ended up dying, a number of people injured, and they tried to stop the confirmation of an election? It's not the same situation, obviously, as we have. And he said, What would you think?And what\u2014I ask the rhetorical question: What would you all think? You'd think England was really in trouble. You'd think democracy was on the edge if that happened in Great Britain. And so that's the way people were looking at us, like, When is this going to stop? Nothing like this has happened since the Civil War. I don't want to exaggerate. But literally, nothing like this has happened since the Civil War.And so what I find is that they want to know: Is the United States stable? Do we know what we're about? Are we the same democracy we've always been? Because, look, the rest of the world looks to us\u2014I don't mean that we're always\u2014like we're always right. But if the United States tomorrow were to, quote, withdraw from the world, a lot of things would change around the world. A whole lot would change.And so they're very concerned that we are still the open democracy we've been and that we have rules and the institutions matter. And that's the context in which I think that they're looking at: Are we back to a place where we are going to accept decisions made by the Court, by the Congress, by the Government, et cetera?\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo you feel like the election represents a shift towards more decency?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Next question, sir. The issue is inflation. TheGrio and KFF conducted a study of Black voters that said inflation was the number-one issue, and we saw it in this midterm election. What can you promise concretely in these next 2 years that will help turn the pocketbook for the better in the midst of staving off a recession?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, a number of things. First of all, Black unemployment is almost cut in half under my administration just since I began. More Black businesses have opened up\u2014small businesses\u2014than ever before.We're now in a situation where we're providing, through the Small Business Administration, downpayments for people buying homes, because most people accumulate wealth in the value of their home, most middle class families like mine. My dad bought a home, didn't have\u2014just scraped together to get a home. By the time he was able to retire, he was\u2014he had built up equity in a home. That's how most people do that.And so\u2014but what I can't do is, I can't guarantee that we're going to be able to get rid of inflation, but I do think we can. We brought\u2014we've already brought down the price of gasoline about $1.20 a gallon across the board. And I think that the oil companies are really doing the Nation a real disservice. They've made\u2014six of them made over $100 billion in the last quarter in profit. A hundred billion dollars.In the past, if they had done the two things that they had done before\u2014one, invest in more refineries and producing more product and/or passing on the rebates to the gas stations that\u2014you know, they sell the oil at a cheaper rate than they have to sell\u2014than they are selling it now, not taking advantage. And that lowers the price of the total gallon of gas because that gets passed on.So there's a whole lot of things that we can do that are difficult to do, but we're going to continue to push to do them.And the other thing is that one of the things that makes a gigantic difference is what are the costs that exist in the average family and the average Black community. One, prescription drug costs. Well, we're driving those down precipitously, beginning next year.And you know, I'll bet you know a lot of people in the African American and Caucasian community that need to take insulin for diabetes. Well, we're going to reduce that cost. They're not going to pay more than $35 for the insulin instead of four\u2014average of $400.And I can go down the list of the things that\u2014my dad used to say it a different way. At the end of the month, the things you have to pay for, from your mortgage to food on the table to gasoline in the automobile, do you have enough money to do it? And when it's done, do you have anything left over? And medical bills are a big piece of that, particularly in the African American community and the poor\u2014and poorer communities. They need help.And so we're driving down all of those costs. And we've already passed the legislation to do that; it's just taking effect. So there's a lot of things we can do to affect the things that people need on a monthly basis to reduce their inflation, their cost of living.And so\u2014but I am optimistic, because we continue to grow and at a rational pace, we're not anywhere near a recession right now, in terms of the growth. But I think we can have what most economists call a soft landing. I'm convinced that we're going to be able to gradually bring down prices so that they, in fact, end up with us not having to move into a recession to be able to get control of inflation.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nCan you guarantee the elimination of inflation?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Last question on humanity. Sir, you can't legislate and you can't Executive order out the issue of empathy or the lack thereof in the midst of this rhetoric\u2014this heated political rhetoric. What's next?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nPart of what I think leadership requires\u2014and I hope I meet this standard\u2014is letting people know you understand their problem. Again, my dad used to have an expression. He said, I don't expect the Government to solve my problems, but I expect them to at least know what they are, understand them.And like a lot of you, we've been very fortunate as a family, but we've also been through a lot of fairly tough times. And it's not\u2014and I've had the great advantage of having a family to get through them.When my first wife and daughter were killed when a tractor trailer broadsided them and killed my wife and\u2014killed my first wife and killed my daughter, and my two boys were expected to die; they were in the\u2014it took the jaws of life 3 hours to get them out. They were on top of their dead mother and dead sister. I understand what that pain is like.And when Jill and I lost Beau after a year in Iraq, winning the Bronze Star and Conspicuous Service Medal, a major in the United States military, came home with stage 4 glioblastoma because he lived about 200\u2014between 2- and 500 yards from burn pit that's 10 feet deep and as big as a football field, burning every toxic waste you could find.You know, I think that we understand what it's like to lose family members, mothers, fathers, to cancer\u2014all of you have been through that kind of thing. We've been fortunate though. We've had each other. We've had strong families\u2014Jill's sisters, my brothers, my sister.And so what we can do to deal with that empathy is make sure there's help available, make sure there's people who are there to help\u2014whether they are a psychologist or whether they're medical doctors or whether they're social workers\u2014to be there to help, to help just hold a hand.And, for example, we can do an awful lot for a lot of families, the families you're talking about, if we\u2014reinstate this child tax credit. It cut child poverty by 40 percent when it was in place. I couldn't get it passed the second time around.So there's a lot we can do. And the empathy is not just talking about it, it's communicating to people you genuinely understand. And I hope a lot of people don't understand, because they\u2014I don't want people having to know the pain.But the second piece of that is, let them know that you are there to help. You're there to help.And one of the things I've talked with Vivek Murthy about\u2014and a lot of you have written about it, and you've written it well about it\u2014is the need for mental health care in America. You know, when we got elected, there were something like, I don't know, 2-, 3-, 5 million people who had gotten their COVID shots.Well, in the meantime\u2014I've got over 220 million people all three shots. But in the meantime, what happened? We lost over a million dead. A million dead.I read one study that for those million people, they had nine people who were\u2014each one of them had, on average, nine people close to them. A relative, someone they're married to, a child\u2014someone close.The impact has been profound. It's been profound. Think of all the people\u2014think of all your children and your grandchildren who didn't have that senior prom, who didn't have that graduation party, who didn't have all the things we had that we took for granted, that impact on their psyche.So there's a lot we have to do. And empathy reflects itself not just on what a person demonstrates they understand\u2014of knowing what people need and helping to make it happen. And we're trying to do that. And a lot of Republicans are trying to do it too. I don't mean this as a partisan thing. A lot of people are trying to do it because they know we've got a problem.Okay, excuse me. These 10 questions are really going quickly.

So will aid to Ukraine continue uninterrupted?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThat is my expectation. It will be\u2014and by the way, we've not given Ukraine a blank check. There's a lot of things that Ukraine wants we didn't do.For example, I was asked very much whether we we'd provide American aircraft to guarantee the skies over Ukraine. I said: No, we're not going to do that. We're not going to get into a third world war, taking on Russian aircraft and directly engage. But would we provide them with all\u2014the rational ability to defend themselves? Yes.We provide those HIMARS. Well, the HIMARS\u2014there's two kinds of, in the average person's parlance, rockets you can drop in those: one that goes over 600 miles and one that goes, oh, about 160 miles. We didn't give them any ones that go to 600 miles, because I'm not looking for them to start bombing Russian territory.And so we want to make sure that there's a relationship that they're able to defend themselves and take on what is purely a\u2014the ugliest aggression that's occurred since World War II on a massive scale, on the part of Putin, within Ukraine. And there's so much at stake.So I would be surprised if Leader McCarthy even has a majority of his Republican colleagues who say they're not going to fund the legitimate defensive needs of Ukraine.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWill aid to Ukraine continue uninterrupted?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

America is Back was your motto at the first NATO summit last year. And you've come to this summit here and the one in Germany after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned constitutional protections for abortion, after the shootings in Buffalo and Texas, at a time of record inflation, and as new polling this week shows that 85 percent of the U.S. public thinks the country is going in the wrong direction.How do you explain this to those people who feel the country is going in the wrong direction, including some of the leaders you've been meeting with this week, who think that when you put all of this together, it amounts to an America that is going backward?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThey do not think that. You haven't found one person, one world leader to say America is going backwards. America is better positioned to lead the world than we ever have been. We have the strongest economy in the world. Our inflation rates are lower than other nations in the world. The one thing that has been destabilizing is the outrageous behavior of the Supreme Court of the United States on overruling not only v. , but essentially challenging the right to privacy.We've been a leader in the world in terms of personal rights and privacy rights, and it is a mistake, in my view, for the Supreme Court to do what it did.But I have not seen anyone come up to me and do anything other than\u2014nor have you heard them say anything other than: Thank you for America's leadership. You've changed the dynamic of NATO and the G-7.So I can understand why the American people are frustrated because of what the Supreme Court did. I can understand why the American people are frustrated because of inflation. But inflation is higher in almost every other country. Prices at the pump are higher in almost every other country. We're better positioned to deal with this than anyone, but we have a way to go.And the Supreme Court\u2014we have to change that decision by codifying v. .\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow do you explain this to those people who feel the country is going in the wrong direction, including some of the leaders you've been meeting with this week, who think that when you put all of this together, it amounts to an America that is going backward?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

And my second question is on your trip to Saudi Arabia, which is coming up next month. As we just discussed, Americans are paying almost $5 a gallon nationally, on average, for gas. So do you expect to ask the Crown Prince or the King to increase oil production? And if so, how will you balance that with your desire to hold them accountable for their human rights abuses?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, that's not the purpose of the trip. The purpose of the trip\u2014my\u2014first of all, I'm starting off on that trip in Israel. And the Israelis are\u2014believe it's really important that I make the trip. And in addition to that, what we're trying to do is that the G-7\u2014it's the Gulf States plus three. And so I'm sure the\u2014it's in Saudi Arabia, but it's not about Saudi Arabia. It's in Saudi Arabia.And so there's no commitment that is being made or\u2014I'm not even sure; I guess I will see the King and the Crown Prince, but that's not the meeting I'm going to. They'll be part of a much larger meeting.And what we're talking about in dealing with that trip is that, before I go, I'm, as I said, going to Israel to meet with Israeli leaders to affirm the unbreakable bond Israel and the United States have. And part of the purpose is\u2014the trip to the Middle East\u2014is to deepen Israel's integration in the region, which I think we're going to be able to do and which is a good\u2014good for peace and good for Israeli security. And that's why Israel leaders have come out so strongly for my going to Saudi.But the overall piece here is, we're also going to try to reduce the deaths and\u2014in the war that's occurring in Yemen.

My name is Yamamoto. Prime Minister, President Biden, thank you very much.First, to Prime Minister: With the Russian aggression of Ukraine, Prime Minister, you've been saying that security of Europe and security of the Indo-Pacific are inseparable. In today's meeting, did you talk about response to China? How did you analyze the current status of the cross-Straits relations? Did the Japanese side or U.S. side explain how U.S. would respond in times of contingency? What was the request from the U.S. side regarding Japanese response to a contingency in cross-Straits situation? Did you explain the defense budget increase or enemy base strike capability? What did you explain in that context, Prime Minister?Prime Minister Kishida. Well, thank you for your question. First of all, at today's summit meeting, as regards Taiwan Strait issue that you asked, we confirmed that basic stances of two countries on Taiwan remains to be unchanged and underscored the importance of peace and stability of Taiwan Strait, which is an indispensable element for security and prosperity of international community, and called upon peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.Well, in the region, security-related environment is getting severer. Unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force, like Russia's aggression against Ukraine this time, should never be tolerated in Indo-Pacific. Above all, in East Asia, it's indispensable to further strengthen Japan-U.S. alliance.Based on this shared awareness, I have said that\u2014fundamentally reinforce Japan's defense capability. And I stated my determination to fundamentally reinforce Japan's defense capabilities and secure substantial increase of its defense budget needed to effect it. And President Biden strongly supported my determination.And also from myself, I have said that includes what is called enemy base strike capability. All the options will be there, not to exclude any one of them. And this is what I said to President in Indo-Pacific region, as well as to ensure the peace and prosperity of the international community, the basis is the cornerstone of which is Japan-U.S. alliance. And toward the further strengthening of the alliance, we would like to remain in close coordination between Japan and the United States.Thank you.Moderator. Thank you very much.U.S. Economy/Foreign Investment in U.S. Manufacturing/Gasoline Prices/Inflation  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for Prime Minister Kishida as well. But, Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about the economy. During your trip here to Asia, you've promoted the investments by Samsung and Hyundai. But back home in the United States, Americans are dealing with record-high inflation. The Fed has raised interest rates to try to address those issues. And there are also just enormously high gas prices.Given the cross-currents of the economy right now\u2014the war in Ukraine, the China lockdowns that we've seen\u2014should Americans be prepared for a recession?

Tight quarters.Thank you so much. I have a question for the Prime Minister, but first to you, Mr. President: We're already dealing with one global pandemic, and you said yesterday that monkeypox is something that everyone should be concerned about. There are a few confirmed cases in the U.S., and some countries are imposing 21-day quarantines for people who are infected or even, in some cases, just exposed. Should Americans expect something similar?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNo, I don't think so. Look, we've had this monkeypox in the larger numbers in the past, number one. Number two, we have vaccines to care for it\u2014to take care of it. Number three, there is\u2014thus far, there doesn't seem to be a need for any kind of extra efforts beyond what's going on. And so I just don't think it rises to the level of the kind of concern that existed with COVID-19 or\u2014and the smallpox vaccine works for it.

Thank you for this opportunity to pose a question. My name is Han Ji-hoon, Yonhap News Agency.First, regarding the concept of economic security, a number of Koreans find the concept pretty unfamiliar. So what are the benefits the Korean economy can gain from the economic security cooperation? What are the real benefits that can be experienced by the Korean people?And in addition to that, you talked about universal values\u2014solidarity and alliance\u2014and you very much underscored that point. But if there are, for example, countries that cannot share those values\u2014for example, strong export regulations or controls that the United States is imposing on other countries\u2014do you think you can take\u2014resort to those measures as well?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nAs you may be very well aware, economic security is probably something that you have already heard and seen through various newspaper channels.Let's say, for example, this is directly related to the livelihoods of our people. And important industrial goods, for them to be produced\u2014for example, let's say that we're trying to produce and manufacture a car, the unique system of semiconductors. And, for example, we had\u2014[inaudible]\u2014water issues recently. And so these are materials that are critically needed for our daily lives as well as our industrial production.And to secure stability in the supply chain is very much and directly related to the lives of the people as well as the national economy. And this is, in turn, related to the national security as well as military security.And in the past, we had the WTO system that brought countries together to form a free and universal trading order, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the formation of the blocks in the market, we see permanent risks when it comes to the supply chain. So it is very important to stabilize the supply chain.And especially our two countries, the United States and Korea, we share the values of democracy and human rights. And among the likeminded countries, they share the values that would be important to stabilize the supply chain. That is why we need to deal with the issue of economic security.The NSCs of the offices of the President are given that authority to deal with this issue. And, for example, if there are any difficult issues to be resolved, then the two countries will be engaged in closer cooperation for economic security. And we decided to pursue this goal going forward.In addition, if you look at the financial market or the foreign exchange market, there could be possible shocks. And when that happens, the two countries can step in to help with each other, and also related to the military security and also economic security. Especially in relation to the export of defense items, what the two countries hope to do is to initiate the negotiations in this area so that we can pave the way for promoting our cooperation in the specific fields.This is not just cooperation in terms of words or empty words\u2014empty promises. It is going to be an alliance that takes action together. And we decided to evolve our alliance even further.And the United States and Korea, we advocate democracy, human rights, and freedom. And even those countries that are not sharing those specific values, for the world peace, of course, we're not trying to exclude them in the process, but we want these countries to be embraced in these universal values.So, especially, we want to start this close solidarity and cooperation among the likeminded countries and countries that share the values.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nThe benefits of economic security cooperation for the Korean economy and people.\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

I am Cho Young-min from Channel A. Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to pose a question. We\u2014this is an extension of the previous question.We talked about how to respond to the evolving nuclear threat of North Korea, that you said that you're going to present an action plan to strengthen the effect of extended deterrence. So, regarding that action plan, I wonder what kind of specific discussions you had today. Did you see eye to eye on this action plan?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nIn the past, when it came to extended deterrence, we just talked about a nuclear umbrella. That was what I thought about extended deterrence in the past.But beyond that, there could be many other aspects, including fighters, bombers, and missiles. So, regarding the timely deployment of such strategic assets, we did engage in the discussions today. And going forward, I believe that there will be more concrete discussions between our two sides. That was our agreement, and it will be between our NSCs.And also, as I already stated in the course of answering the question from the U.S. journalist: In order to prepare against a possible nuclear attack, our two countries combined military exercises, I believe, should be stepped up in many aspects. We had that discussion.Thank you.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nRegarding the action plan to strengthen the effect of extended deterrence, the question asks about the specific discussions had and whether both sides saw eye to eye on this plan.\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

And my final question: Because you're heading to Poland tomorrow, do you think that getting a firsthand look at the effects of this war on these millions of Ukrainians who have fled their country could change the way that you might respond?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI don't think so, because I've been to many, many war zones. I've been in refugee camps. I've been in war zones for the last 15 years. And it's devastating. And what\u2014the thing you look at the most is you see these young children, you see children without parents that are in those camps or in\u2014or refugees. You see women and husbands\u2014men and women who are completely lost and have no\u2014you see the look\u2014that blank look on their face, that absolute feeling of: My God, where am I? What's going to happen to me?And so it\u2014what it will do, it will reinforce my commitment to have the United States make sure we are a major piece of dealing with the relocation of all those folks, as well as humanitarian assistance needed both inside and outside .For example, this is not something that Poland or Romania or Germany should carry on their own. This is an international responsibility. And the United States, as the leader\u2014one of the leaders in the international community, has an obligation to be engaged\u2014to be engaged and do all we can to ease the suffering and pain of innocent women and children, and men, for that matter, throughout and those who have made it across the border.I plan on attempting to see those folks, as well as I hope I'm going to be able to see\u2014I guess I'm not supposed to say where I'm going, am I?

Mr. President, one question to you: The U.S., over the last few years, have exported heavy weapons to Ukraine, and Germany excludes that\u2014has only delivered 5,000 helmets to Ukraine. Don't you think that NATO should act unanimously in this respect and Germany, as the strongest European NATO partner, should also deliver heavy weapons to Ukraine? And Ukraine has asked Germany to do so.And on Nord Stream 2, I would also like to ask: Don't you think, with regard to the threat posed by Russia, Germany should already rethink its position on Nord Stream 2?And the third question, if I may: Over the last few days and weeks, there has been severe criticism from the U.S. media and from Congress as well vis-\u00e0-vis Germany about the reliability of Germany as an ally. This has been called into question. Do you understand this criticism? Is Germany a reliable partner, from your point of view?And, Mr. Chancellor, also a question to you: Nord Stream 2\u2014you said all options are on the table. You're not mentioning Nord Stream 2 by name. Don't you think if you were to spell this out, you could win back trust as a strong ally here for the U.S.?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThere's no need to win back trust. He has the complete trust of the United States. Germany is our\u2014one of our most important allies in the world. There is no doubt about Germany's partnership with the United States. None.With regard to helping Ukraine, one of the largest contributors financially to Ukraine has been Germany. Germany has been in the forefront of making sure\u2014providing economic assistance.You also asked the question\u2014you asked so many, I can't remember them all. But in terms of the U.S. media saying Germany is not reliable, Germany is completely reliable\u2014completely, totally, thoroughly reliable. I have no doubt about Germany at all. We are united. And the transatlantic partnership between Germany and the U.S. is one of the permanent pillars of German policy, and it will be relevant in the future as well\u2014just as relevant. And this will be one of our top priorities always.On behalf of NATO, we are the country in continental Europe that is doing\u2014making the largest contribution: financial means and also military power. And we are the country that contributes a great share\u2014we're not fully\u2014we don't fully agree with you as who pays the biggest part of financial support to Ukraine. And so, since 2014, about 2 billion U.S. dollars direct bilateral support and, within the EU, an additional 3.8 billion that is made available. So a substantial financial means to stabilize the Ukrainian economy, and we are willing to continue with that sort of contribution.So this is the very strong and unbreakable friendship between our two countries. Part of this is that with regard to the difficult situation at the Ukrainian border due to the Russian troops, we have made it very clear we will unanimously act in terms of sanctions.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nIs Germany a reliable partner to the United States?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

And to Chancellor Scholz: Can you outline specific steps that Germany is taking to reduce its energy dependence on Russia? And what do you say to those who suggest that German reliance on Russian gas is limiting Europe's options for how to respond to the crisis in Ukraine?Chancellor Scholz. Thank you very much for raising that question because it gives me the opportunity to address a topic that's important to me. One good news, maybe, within its strategy on fighting manmade climate change, Germany has decided at very short\u2014in a very short period of time to phase out of the use of oil and gas by\u2014very soon. And by 2045, Germany will have a carbon-neutral economy as one of the strongest economies of the world.And with regard to these energies\u2014we often think about heating at home and driving a car, but we're talking about industrial production: producing steel, chemical substances, cement. And changing these industrial processes and reorganizing such systems is what we have planned.So this year, we will continue to take far-reaching decisions that will help us to use more wind energy\u2014offshore wind energy, onshore wind energy\u2014and solar energy; and expand the capacities, expand the grids; and have a strategy for Germany, but also worldwide on the use of hydrogen, which is a central element for us to change our industrial processes that are using oil and gas right now.The industry is willing to be on board. We're doing this together with them, but it will probably be the biggest industrial modernization project in Germany in 100 years, with very good prospects that we will develop new technologies that other partners in the world can use as well, and this will help us fight climate change.And by the way, the energy mix today, we are talking about one-quarter of our energy that is linked to gas. And only part of that gas comes from Russia; a big part comes from Norway or the Netherlands. And of course, it is very important to us that we develop an infrastructure that will give us the opportunity to have all options available and react if needed.So you don't have to be concerned. There are some who should be concerned who see themselves maybe too much as a deliverer of such resources. Because we are focusing on renewable energies, we will go down that path and make sure that this is the profitable future.Mr. Rinke [Andreas Rinke, Reuters].Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)/U.S. Energy Exports/Russia  Q. Mr. President, I would like to ask you a question about LNG. Germany and Europe are much more dependent on Russian gas than other regions of the world, and you promised European allies to help with LNG. But this resource is more expensive; it's not available in the volumes that might be needed to replace Russian gas. And I would like to know from you how you would help Europeans in case of a conflict with Russia. Is this an empty promise, or what can you really do? What can you offer?And, in addition, the U.S. are buying oil from Russia worth billions of dollars. And I would like to know whether these transfers are also part of the sanctions package against Russia.And, Mr. Chancellor\u2014liquefied natural gas. There is a big controversy in Germany about fracking gas. And how far is LNG even a real replacement, or is it also with a view to the climate club you intend to found? Is it really an alternative to Russian pipeline gas?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nLet me respond. First of all, we are looking at opportunities to make up for lost gas\u2014LNG\u2014from Russia. We're underway of trying to see what we can do to do that and dealing with our friends around the world, as well. We think we could make up a significant portion of it that would be lost.But you know, what everybody forgets here is, Russia needs to be able to sell that gas and sell that oil. Russia relies\u2014a significant part of Russia's budget\u2014it's the only thing they really have to export. And if in fact it's cut off, then they're going to be hurt very badly as well. And it's of consequence to them as well. This is not just a one-way street.And so we are looking at what we could do to help compensate for loss of\u2014immediate loss of gas in Europe if it occurs. And that's what we've been working on for some time now. I can confirm that we work closely with the United States of America, and Joe Biden and I are working closely together as well.We are prepared for all kinds of situation. And that's part of what we do when we say we prepare sanctions. That means we need to be able to react at any time, and this is happening.With regard to the use of LNG, I can say that the biggest volume of LNG used across the world is the gas, and that is part of the debate.Concerning a long-term perspective, I already outlined what this is about. We will modernize our economy. And where gas is being used, we will switch to hydrogen. This will be a process that will happen faster than many might imagine today, and that will create a bright future for all of us. Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nSpecific steps to reduce energy dependence on Russia\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}
