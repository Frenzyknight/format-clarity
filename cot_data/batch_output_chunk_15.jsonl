However, he does *not* lay out a specific, step-by-step pathway or concrete plan.\\n2) On whether he asked Trump to raise the abduction issue, both Trump and Abe indicate that abduction was discussed and that Trump promised to raise it at the summit.

The requested \u201cconcrete pathway\u201d is therefore only addressed in a very general, aspirational way.\\n2) Asking Trump to raise abduction: Partially *explicit, partially implicit*.

He even explicitly says he will \u201crefrain from mentioning\u201d concrete matters regarding the U.S.\u2013North Korea summit. Thus, the topic is addressed, but the requested concrete detail is missing; the answer is too general and aspirational to count as a clear, fully informative reply.\\n\\nFor the second part (whether he asked Trump to raise the abduction issue), the exchange gives partial clarity: Trump says Abe talked about abduction at length and that he will follow Abe\u2019s wishes and discuss it. Abe says he explained the issue again, conveyed the families\u2019 wishes, and that Trump promised to raise it at the summit.
