Hello, Mr. President, I am Park from CBS. And I would like to, first of all, welcome President Trump upon your second visit to the Republic of Korea. At the restricted bilateral meeting this morning, President Moon, you had mentioned that you will be accompanying President Trump to the DMZ, but the focus of the dialogue that will happen at the DMZ will be between President Trump and Chairman Kim. And you said that you are looking forward to much progress being achieved there.So at\u2014once the contact is established between President Trump and Chairman Kim at the DMZ, what kind of progress do you expect in the subsequent negotiations? And is\u2014how about the possibility of a third U.S.-North Korea summit happening before the end of the year?And my third question relates to the written interview that you had given to various agencies recently. And in that interview, you had mentioned that if North Korea, under complete inspection verification from the international community\u2014if North Korea dismantles the nuclear complex in Yongbyon\u2014then the international community could explore the sanctions relief, a partial sanctions relief.So has there been any discussions regarding this issue this morning? And what was the response from the U.S. side?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes. To answer your question, yes, I have been invited to visit Panmunjom with President Trump this afternoon. However, as I had mentioned, the focus of the dialogue today will be the dialogue between the United States and . And of course, President Trump and Chairman Kim will have a reunion and have subsequent dialogue, and I hope that\u2014and I do believe that this is vastly significant for the dialogue that will follow after the meeting today.And also, today there will be a dialogue between the United States and . But as for the inter-Korean dialogue, this will happen at a later time.As for the question regarding the third U.S.- summit, I believe that how the reunion and the dialogue and the meeting turns out this afternoon will have a great say on when and whether the U.S.- summit will happen for the third time. So I do expect some progress there.As for the last question, the\u2014what I had explained was that if goes through the dismantlement in a genuine way\u2014dismantlement of the nuclear complex in Yongbyon\u2014then this will mean that we will be entering\u2014we will be arriving at the entrance of irreversible, substantive denuclearization. So if this indeed is implemented, then the international community will able to discuss a partial sanctions relief.

We all appreciate it. It's always good to have a chance to ask questions of you directly. Can you tell us a little more about how this China deal may work going forward? Because Chinese officials have told Fox News that they will not make any concessions until all of the tariffs have been lifted. They also want relief on Huawei. They want it taken off the blacklist. They might want you to stop pursuing extradition of Meng Wanzhou. Can you tell us how you see all of this unfolding?And if you do meet Kim Jong Un at the DMZ tomorrow, would you step across the border into North Korea?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nSure I would. I would. I'd feel very comfortable doing that. I would have no problem.With respect to China basically we agreed today that we were going to continue the negotiation\u2014which I ended a while back\u2014and we're going to continue the negotiation. We agreed that I would not be putting tariffs on the $325 billion that I would have the ability to put on if I wanted; that\u2014where you know we're fairly advanced depending on where you want to look at and where you want to start. Pretty advanced.We discussed\u2014we did discuss numerous other things. We mentioned Huawei. I said: We'll have to save that until the very end. We'll have to see.One of the things I will allow however is\u2014a lot of people are surprised\u2014we send and we sell to Huawei a tremendous amount of product that goes into the various things that they make. And I said that that's okay that we will keep selling that product. These are American companies John that make product. And that's very complex by the way. Highly scientific.And in some cases we're the ones that do it and we're the only ones that do it. We're the only ones with the technology. What we've done in Silicon Valley is incredible actually. And nobody has been able to compete with it. And I've agreed\u2014and pretty easily\u2014I've agreed to allow them to continue to sell that product so American companies will continue. And they were having a problem. The companies were not exactly happy that they couldn't sell because they had nothing to do with whatever was potentially happening with respect to Huawei. So I did do that. We talked about education and students. Somebody was saying it was harder for a Chinese students to come in. And that's something that if it were\u2014if somebody viewed it that way I don't. We want to have Chinese students come and use our great schools our great universities. They've been great students and tremendous assets. But we did discuss it. It was brought up as a point and I said that will be just like anybody else just like any other nation.And we're actually going to a point where you know we're looking that if you graduate from a college because our great companies\u2014we talk about Silicon Valley and other places\u2014we have a problem in this\u2014in our country that you graduate number one in your class from the best school in the country and you\u2014they say you have to leave; we can't keep them.

Yes, but\u2014okay.Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election/Former President Jimmy Carter  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday former President Jimmy Carter suggested that your Presidency is illegitimate and that you only got the White House with help from Russia. Your reaction to that, sir?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nRussia. Russia. Russia. Isn't it crazy?Okay Jimmy Carter\u2014look he was a nice man. He was a terrible President. He's a Democrat. And it's a typical talking point. He's loyal to the Democrats and I guess you should be.But as everybody now understands I won not because of Russia not because of anybody but myself. I went out\u2014I campaigned better smarter harder than Hillary Clinton. I went to Wisconsin. I went to Michigan the night of the vote. I had 32000 people at 1 o'clock in the morning on election day. I won Michigan. I won Wisconsin. I won Pennsylvania. I won States that traditionally haven't been won by a Republican for many years haven't been won by a Republican.And this had nothing to do with anybody but the fact that I worked harder and much smarter than Hillary Clinton did.Now I'll say this: Jimmy Carter\u2014I was surprised that he would make a statement. I saw it. It was not a big thing but I saw the statement. And it's\u2014you know a lot of Democrats like to make that statement. He's been trashed within his own party. He's been badly trashed. I felt badly for him because if you look over the years his party has virtually\u2014he's like the forgotten President. And I understand why they say that. He was not a good President. Look at what happened with . That was a disaster. What did to him they tied him up in knots. The reason Ronald Reagan probably because President. So you know it's a Democrat talking point.Yes please. Go ahead.

He follows you on Twitter?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI guess so because we got a call very quickly. [] A lot of people follow it. But you know they've contacted us and they'd like to see if they can do something. And we're not talking about for you know extended. Just a quick hello.And we get along. I get along with him and I get along with other people. Like you know for instance on Jim's question it's a fair question but I really have great relationships with everybody.I think\u2014you know I said a long time ago that maybe I'll be a sleeper on foreign policy. And if you look at what's happened on foreign policy\u2014now we are working on and we'll see what happens. I think they'd like to make a deal. I think they'd be very smart to want to make a deal but we're going to see what happens. I'm okay. I have all the time in the world.They're doing very poorly. They were doing\u2014they were very brutal when I first came in. Eighteen sites of confliction meaning where they were behind. But I think on foreign policy if you look at what's happening\u2014and the other thing that's happening is we're not being taken for suckers anymore.I mean we have countries where we'd lose on defending them because we defend a tremendous percentage of the world. And they don't pay us for it. And then on top of it we lose money with that same country on trade. And it's all changing. And they understand it's changing. And they expect it to change. They can't believe.Honestly like I'd ask Prime Minister Abe\u2014I said How did this happen where you send us billions and billions of dollars' worth of cars and other things and we send you practically nothing? He said Nobody ever complained. Same thing with China. I said: You know you send a car to us. We charge you essentially nothing. It's 2\u00bd percent but basically you don't have to\u2014there are ways around that. So you send a car to us and you pay nothing. We send a car to you made in the United States and we have to pay 45-percent tariff. How did that happen? He said We just kept lifting it lifting it lifting it. I mean they're being honest with me. We just kept lifting it and nobody called. But I call. I call.Go ahead Jon.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHe follows you on Twitter?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Did you agree that Huawei can sell to the U.S. or that U.S. companies can sell to Huawei? The President. U.S. companies can sell their equipment to Huawei. We're talking about equipment where there is no great national emergency problem with it. But the U.S. companies can sell their equipment. So we have a lot of the great companies in Silicon Valley and based in different parts of the country that make extremely complex equipment. We're letting them sell to Huawei.Turkey/Turkey's Purchase of Russian S-400 Antiaircraft System  Q. And then, on Turkey, sir, will Turkey face sanctions if it goes ahead with the S-400 purchases?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nOkay so Turkey is an interesting case\u2014because there's another one Jim that I get along with very well and he's a tough cookie okay? Right? President Erdogan. He's tough but I get along with him. And maybe that's a bad thing but I think it's a really good thing. Because frankly he wanted to wipe out\u2014he has a big problem with the Kurds as everyone knows. And he had a 65000-man army at the border and he was going to wipe out the Kurds who helped us with ISIS. We took out the caliphate. We have a hundred percent of the caliphate.And I called him and I asked him not to do it. They are I guess natural enemies of his or Turkey's. And he hasn't done it. He had\u2014they were lined up to go out and wipe out the people that we just defeated the ISIS caliphate with and I said You can't do that. You can't do it. And he didn't do it.So I have a relationship. But let me tell you\u2014so he goes out during the Obama administration; he wants to buy our Patriot missile. Right? They wouldn't sell it to him. He wants to buy\u2014even though he's a member of NATO and in theory he could be an ally if he respected the President. He\u2014and he's got a big army and he's\u2014you know they're fighters. Turkey is\u2014big fighters. And we're working on Idlib Province together because he doesn't want to see 3 million people killed and neither do I\u2014in Syria. But\u2014and I mentioned that. That was another thing I mentioned folks to President Putin. I said Please take it easy with Idlib. Because you know they've been encircling that.I think if I didn't put out a statement 6 months ago that would've been catastrophic. But they have 30000 terrorists in Idlib Province. You have 3 million people. And you know getting terrorists is okay but you don't want to kill 3 million people or a million people to get the terrorists.So anyway\u2014so we get along great. But what happened with Turkey\u2014and I will tell you when it's fair and when it's not fair. He wanted to buy the Patriot missile. President Obama's group said no. He kept wanting to buy it. They kept saying no no no. Couldn't buy it. Now he needed it for defense. He needed it. So he then went to Russia and he bought the S-400. Made a deal to buy it because he couldn't get it. They wouldn't allow him to buy it. They wouldn't allow it. This administration meaning this administration previous to mine would not let him buy it.So he goes out he goes to Russia and he makes a deal for the S-400. And let's assume it's not nearly as good but he made a deal. He paid them money a lot of money. Put up a lot of money. And he bought it. As soon as he bought it people went back to him from our country and they said Listen we don't want you to use that system because it's not the NATO system et cetera et cetera\u2014you know all the reasons: We don't want you to use that system. Do us a favor we'll sell you the Patriot. He said It's too late. I already bought it. There was nothing he could do; he already bought it.In the meantime he bought over a hundred F-35s the greatest fighter jet in the world. It's stealth. You can't see it. It's real hard to beat something when you can't see it. But he bought over a hundred. I think he bought 116. But he bought over a hundred. A lot. And he has options for more. And now he wants delivery. He's paid a tremendous amount of money up front to Lockheed our company our jobs everything. And now they're saying he's using the S-400 system which is incompatible with our system and if you use the S-400 system Russia and other people can gain access into the genius of the F-35.But honestly I'm all for our country but he got treated very unfairly. He was told you can't buy it you can't buy it. You know it's the old secret when you can't have something all of a sudden he ends up going and getting something else and then they were\u2014they said\u2014first they said: We'll sell it to you. You can have it in 4 years. Then they said We'll get it to you immediately. But he said: I can't do it. I bought. I've spent a fortune on buying another system\u2014similar system\u2014from Russia. The problem is he already bought the planes. And the planes aren't compatible from our standpoint.

You don't seem like you want to go ahead with the sanctions?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI love our country but I have to tell you President Erdogan who has done\u2014he gave me our pastor back Pastor Brunson. Nobody else could get him back. Remember? They couldn't get him back. President Obama he was in jail for 35 years. He was going to be in jail forever. Pastor Brunson he was an innocent man.I called him. And after a very short period of time Pastor Brunson was standing in the Oval Office with me. And he was back. So you know he's been\u2014from my standpoint\u2014and he's a tough guy. Okay? When you talk about tough. He's tough. But I get along with him.I think he was unfairly treated where you were told you can't have it and then after he bought another system we were said\u2014we said: We'll sell it to you. We'll give it to you right away. But he couldn't use it then. But by that time he had already bought the plane.So it's a complicated deal. We're working on it.

But we could do it quickly. We could do it in a day. We could do it in an hour. We could reform asylum very quickly. We could get rid of the loopholes very quickly. These are horrible loopholes.And the reason that Mexico is so good\u2014because they do have very very tough immigration. They don't have the kind of things and the kind of stupidity that we have. I mean where somebody touches one foot on our sand and we now have to bring them into a court. We then have to register them. We then have to catch and release them. And they go and they live in our country. Then they're supposed to come back in 3 years for a court case and about 2 percent come back very\u2014as you know. I mean you know it just as well as anybody I really think. Maybe better than most.But the fact is they come back\u2014but nobody comes back. Two percent come back. It's a horrible system. Now what we're doing is they come in illegally and we're bringing them out legally. But at the request of some you know very good Democrats they asked me if I could hold it. And I did for a couple of weeks. And we have a week left.

That's humanitarian\u2014no that's a different\u2014that's humanitarian. We needed that just to take care\u2014because we're running now hospitals. I mean the Border Patrol\u2014these are incredible people\u2014they're doing what they\u2014you know nobody ever thought they were going to be doing this.And people are coming up\u2014the reason people are coming up is because we're doing so well as a country. In past years we weren't doing well. In past years Mexico was doing better. You know they took 32 percent of our car business. They were doing better than we were doing in the past. Now we're the hot country in the world and people are coming up because they want a piece of that action.And the other reason children are coming up is because we had a separation policy. Okay? Under President Obama we had separation. President Obama built those cells. They were in 2014. They were built. They all said Oh look how horrible. Then it turned out that it was built by President Obama. And I'm not blaming anybody. I'm not blaming him.I just say this: They had a separation policy. Right? I ended it. But when I ended it I put out a statement: I think it's going to bring more children up because you're ending it. You're saying now the child can stay with the parent. So I said ending it is nice in one way but in terms of what we're doing it makes it even tougher.But the really bad thing is the cartels\u2014and I really think that Mexico\u2014because you know they did 6000; now they're doing 16000 on our border\u2014I think that Mexico is looking to swamp the cartels. And those kind of numbers will do it. It would be a great thing. What Mexico is doing for us is great.By the way without the tariffs they wouldn't have done it folks. We've been after\u2014we've been after them for many years to do it.But they have really so far\u2014it's only a week\u2014the numbers are way down.

Edward Szall with TruNews. President Trump, your administration just unveiled the economic portion of the deal of the century. My question to you is: Why were no Palestinians members of the White House peace plan committee?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell they are a very important part of it but they don't really have to be. We're just getting started.We have\u2014and as you know we have a very good\u2014David Friedman a great gentleman. One of the most successful lawyers in New York who loves Israel\u2014David Friedman. Jason Greenblatt who worked for me and my company great great lawyer. Great talent. Jared Kushner. And with me being President if you don't get that deal done it will never happen. We'll have to see what happens.But I think the Palestinians basically\u2014I'm not sure\u2014I know they want to make a deal but they want to be a little bit cute and that's okay. I fully understand where they're coming from.As you know I've ended the money to\u2014that was\u2014we were paying them $550 million a year and I ended that money because a year ago I heard they were saying nasty things. I said: Wait a minute. We're trying to make a deal. We're trying to help them and they're saying these nasty things? We're not going to pay.Now if a deal is made we would go back on a humanitarian basis. Not so different from the border. Because you see the problems and what's going on. It's terrible. But I think we have a very good chance of making a deal and a lot of people think that's probably the toughest deal of all. And it may very well be the toughest deal of all. A lot of people think it can't be made. I mean over the years a lot of people would say That's a deal that can't be made no matter what.But you know hey I like to\u2014we're going to try. But I really believe that\u2014I went to other negotiators from past years. For many many years they've been trying to make this deal. And I said Did you ever take the money away? Because they were always very hostile. And they said: No we wouldn't do that. That's inappropriate. Why is it inappropriate? I mean they're saying bad things. Why is it inappropriate?And what I've done is said Look as long\u2014if you're not negotiating and if you don't want to make peace we're not going to pay you. So let's see what happens.I think they want to make a deal and I've had a very good relationship with some of their leaders. And obviously I've had a good relationship with Israel.Now the transaction was thrown up in the air a little bit because of what happened with Bibi Netanyahu's election. They thought he won and then all of a sudden they couldn't put together the coalition. And now they're back to campaigning again. So that was something that came up that\u2014who would have expected that. Maybe something will happen faster but you know that's going to be going on for about 3 months.There's a good chance we could\u2014there's a chance. I don't want to even say good chance on that one because people say it's the hardest deal. I've heard\u2014when I was young I'd say What do you think of this? They'd say Oh that's tougher than Israel and the Palestinians making a deal. They used to use that as like the metaphor. They used to use that as the excuse for a deal that was very tough to make. So it's probably about the toughest deal to make.I actually think that there's a good chance.Yes sir. Please go ahead. Yes. White shirt. No the gentleman behind you. Yes. Okay go ahead.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhy were no Palestinians members of the White House peace plan committee?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

You praised this G-20 summit as extremely successful, yet it was a G-19 against one summit if we look at climate change.

So we have the best numbers that we've ever had recently. And I'm not looking to put our companies out of business. I'm not looking to create a standard that is so high that we're going to lose 20 25 percent of our production. I'm not willing to do that. We have the cleanest water we've ever had. We have the cleanest air. You saw the reports come out recently. We have the cleanest air we've ever had. But I'm not willing to sacrifice the tremendous power of what we've built up over a long period of time and what I've enhanced and revived. I'm not\u2014I'm just not willing to do that.And they understand where I stand. And you know I'm not necessarily sure I agree. I can tell you I'm not sure that I agree with certain countries what they're doing. Because I think they're losing a lot of the power of what they can do with factories and with\u2014and I'm not talking about political power although that comes with it\u2014I'm talking about the powering of a plant. It doesn't always work with a windmill. When the wind goes off the plant isn't working. It doesn't always work with solar because solar is just not strong enough.And a lot of them want to go to wind which has caused a lot of problems. And you know the problem with wind is in the United States we're subsidizing these wind towers all over the place because wind doesn't work\u2014for the most part doesn't work without subsidy. And I don't want to be subsidizing things that don't have to be subsidized.The United States is paying tremendous amounts of money on subsidies for wind. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't want to do that.We'll take a few more. Go ahead.

Is it possible\u2014would you say it's a possibility that Huawei is going to be removed from the list? The President. Is it going to what? Q. Removed from the entity list. Is it possible?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI don't want to talk about it now. I mean we're looking at that very carefully. Huawei is very much in play in terms of our country and in terms of intelligence and the intelligence community. We know a lot about Huawei. But I don't want to mention that right now. I just think it's inappropriate.I will say that we're not making it\u2014other than what I told you already we're not making it a big subject. We're going to save that for later.

I just will tell you very strongly that I think Germany is making a tremendous mistake by relying so heavily on the pipeline. And I think it's a tremendous mistake for Germany. But again, Germany is running their affairs. And they'll do just fine.But I was critical. I had been critical of it. It's a tremendous amount of their energy will be supplied by that pipeline.At the same time, having nothing to do with Germany, Poland said that we would like to build a facility, a great facility, and we'd like to have you come to that facility. So we're going to be there with a limited force, but we'll be there. And we appreciate Poland doing what they're doing. It's a great location. It's a tremendous\u2014it's a tremendous plant, tremendous facility. And we\u2014it's our honor to be there.Poland has been a tremendous friend of ours for a long time. And when Melania and I were there not so long ago, it was a very special day. I think it was a special day for Poland, also. But it was a very special day for our country. So I appreciate that.

A question to President Duda. Mr. President, so far, we have been talking about a rotational presence of U.S. troops in our country. Right now we are talking about permanent or enduring presence. What does that mean in concrete terms? And when can we expect those additional U.S. troops to arrive?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI understand it in the follow way: President Donald Trump and myself are implementing a very calm but consistent policy in terms of security. The presence of the United States in Poland\u2014the military presence\u2014the presence of U.S. troops, which today is about 4,500 troops present on a permanent basis. In other words, it is a rotational presence but it is back-to-back presence. So there is no moment where there are no American troops in the territory of Poland.And today we signed a document and further cooperation: a Joint Declaration on Defense Cooperation Regarding the United States Force Posture in the Republic of Poland. This is of a breakthrough character because it moves us to another era. So far, we can say that the Americans were testing the situation in Poland: how it looks, how it feels; what about logistics; whether it is possible to stay in Poland and to successfully attain the goals and implement the tasks of defensive nature.I think that the commanders of U.S. Army are convinced that this is simply possible. And today, the documents speaks about this enduring presence, the presence which is a fact and which will stay there.It is a rotational presence as it is because this is most beneficial from today's perspective to train soldiers through rotational presence. By having rotational presence, more soldiers can come to a country, be present there, look at a culture and the condition in place in a given country. So this is beneficial for this barely understood\u2014a development of the Armed Forces. Therefore, this is an enduring presence. However, it is implementing this particular way.And we hope it's going to develop 1,000 troops, mentioned by President Trump today, which is also\u2014the numbers stipulated in the agreement signed today is very differentiated. It is not one single unit. We are talking about special operation forces. We are talking about logistics component. We are also talking about the already-mentioned division headquarters.So there is a multitude of forums in which the United States is going to be gradually ever-more present in our territory, from the military standpoint. And this will encompass different fields of cooperation. So we're not talking about just one single beat, but we're talking about a more comprehensive cooperation. We're talking about logistics health protection for soldiers and a number of other elements happening. Please remember that right now there is this missile defense facility being built in Redzikowo. So, talking about the elements of Polish-American cooperation, there are more and more of these elements, and the number is growing. I'm very happy with that. Thank you very much. Let's see, who do I like? [] Nobody. That's the end. []Go ahead.

A question to President Duda. Mr. President, so far, we have been talking about a rotational presence of U.S. troops in our country. Right now we are talking about permanent or enduring presence. What does that mean in concrete terms? And when can we expect those additional U.S. troops to arrive?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI understand it in the follow way: President Donald Trump and myself are implementing a very calm but consistent policy in terms of security. The presence of the United States in Poland\u2014the military presence\u2014the presence of U.S. troops, which today is about 4,500 troops present on a permanent basis. In other words, it is a rotational presence but it is back-to-back presence. So there is no moment where there are no American troops in the territory of Poland.And today we signed a document and further cooperation: a Joint Declaration on Defense Cooperation Regarding the United States Force Posture in the Republic of Poland. This is of a breakthrough character because it moves us to another era. So far, we can say that the Americans were testing the situation in Poland: how it looks, how it feels; what about logistics; whether it is possible to stay in Poland and to successfully attain the goals and implement the tasks of defensive nature.I think that the commanders of U.S. Army are convinced that this is simply possible. And today, the documents speaks about this enduring presence, the presence which is a fact and which will stay there.It is a rotational presence as it is because this is most beneficial from today's perspective to train soldiers through rotational presence. By having rotational presence, more soldiers can come to a country, be present there, look at a culture and the condition in place in a given country. So this is beneficial for this barely understood\u2014a development of the Armed Forces. Therefore, this is an enduring presence. However, it is implementing this particular way.And we hope it's going to develop 1,000 troops, mentioned by President Trump today, which is also\u2014the numbers stipulated in the agreement signed today is very differentiated. It is not one single unit. We are talking about special operation forces. We are talking about logistics component. We are also talking about the already-mentioned division headquarters.So there is a multitude of forums in which the United States is going to be gradually ever-more present in our territory, from the military standpoint. And this will encompass different fields of cooperation. So we're not talking about just one single beat, but we're talking about a more comprehensive cooperation. We're talking about logistics health protection for soldiers and a number of other elements happening. Please remember that right now there is this missile defense facility being built in Redzikowo. So, talking about the elements of Polish-American cooperation, there are more and more of these elements, and the number is growing. I'm very happy with that. Thank you very much. Let's see, who do I like? [] Nobody. That's the end. []Go ahead. Yes.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhen can we expect additional U.S. troops to arrive?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, sir. Regarding China, what is your deadline, if you have one, for China to make progress on trade before you impose the tariffs on the other $325 billion in goods?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, we're going to be meeting\u2014President Xi and myself\u2014and you know we have a very good relationship. But, again, he's for China, and I'm for the U.S. It's a big difference. And we thought we had a deal. We didn't have a deal. And I would never make something that would be less than what we already had.We had China opened up to trade. That's a big thing. They've never done that before. We had intellectual property theft taken care of and taken care of beautifully. And all of the sudden, those things started to disappear at the end, after they were fully negotiated.But that's\u2014you know, that's their decision. I think if they had to do again\u2014and in light of the fact that we have 25 percent on $250 billion of goods coming into the United States. And unlike a lot of countries, they subsidize those goods. We haven't had inflation. And you know, they keep saying that the American taxpayer is paying for it. No. No. Very little.And what it really does mean is that a lot of those companies that are in China are going to be moving back to the U.S. You have car companies\u2014General Motors, as an example\u2014that built plants in China. Well, that doesn't work out too well when you have the tariff wall up because now they're going to have to get through that and they can't really get through that. So maybe they'll start building plants in the United States instead.I think that we'll end up making a deal with China. We have a very good relationship, although it's a little bit testy right now, as you would expect. I think they really have to make a deal. A lot of companies are leaving China, as you know. It's in all the reports. And they're going to Vietnam and various other places, and they're also coming to the United States to make their product because they don't want to pay the tariff.And there is no tariff if you do it in the United States. People don't realize that. You know, they say the tariff, but there is no tariff if you don't do it\u2014you know, if you just do exactly as I say: You bring your company back to the United States.And as far as Mexico is concerned, which was a very big topic yesterday\u2014and now people are finding out that the reports that were written were totally false\u2014we would never have had a deal with Mexico without imposing tariffs. Once the tariffs were imposed\u2014and they've been trying to make this deal with Mexico for 20 years, 25 years. The older reporters, those great reporters with the very gray hair in the back\u2014you know who I'm talking about; they know exactly what I'm talking about\u2014you would have never made the deal with Mexico.We have a great deal with Mexico. I actually think we have a much better relationship right now with Mexico because they respect us again. But you would never have had that deal if I didn't impose the tariffs. And those tariffs were ready to go to on Monday morning, and we made the deal on, essentially, Sunday night.And that extra little page of the deal that you saw that brilliantly\u2014I had gained such respect for you people when I held it up to the sunlight and it was closed, and you were able to read it through the sunlight. That was not anticipated. But regardless, I mean, you knew enough of what it said. And I didn't do it on purpose, but we have a lot of strength in 45 days if we decide to use that strength. Maybe we will, and maybe we won't. But there's a lot of power right now in the border.And I will say this: Mexico is, right now, doing more for the United States on illegal immigration and all of the problems of crime and other problems on the border than the Democrats. We can solve our problem on the border in 15 minutes if the Democrats would sit down, straighten out asylum\u2014which is a total mess, but very uncomplicated\u2014straighten out asylum, and get rid of the loopholes. It would take, Jeff, 15 minutes.Okay? Thank you. Please.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat is the deadline for China to make progress on trade before imposing tariffs on the remaining $325 billion in goods?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

And, President Duda, if I could just throw one your way as well: You said in the Oval Office earlier that democracy in Poland was strong. Not all of your European Union counterparts agree with that. How is forcing Supreme Court justices to retire early consistent with democratic principles? And, President Trump, is that something that you support?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNo. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very complex issue. And it's hard to answer this question because a lot of people in Western Europe\u2014I think also in the U.S.\u2014do not fully understand this problem because they have not grown up in a country such as mine.I was born in 1972, in a Poland which was in the Russian sphere of influence, in which a career could be made only, actually, when somebody enrolled as member of the Communist Party and who followed these people's power who was the supreme authority. And this is what was happening for many years.Although, as you know, ladies and gentlemen, as Solidarity movement grew, people were imprisoned, people were tortured, people were killed during the martial law, and after as well\u2014be it openly or in a secret way. And this was the reality of Poland until 1989.And now imagine, ladies and gentlemen, that no so long ago\u2014a few years ago\u2014I was surprised to discover that, in the Polish Supreme Court, there was a whole group of justices who were issuing sentencing as judges\u2014members of the Communist Party\u2014before 1990, who were even passing sentences during the martial law, sentencing people to prisons based on the law of the Communist martial law.And when I was asked whether the Supreme Court needs to be reformed, I said yes. If Poland is supposed to be a truly democratic, free, and sovereign country, if it is supposed to be a country we want it to be for our children, for the generation who was born after, in 1989, then for God's sake, those people have to leave. They have to retire. And this is what we did.As a matter of fact, everything that we were doing was aimed at retiring those people. But, as you can see, unfortunately, although 30 years have passed, they have got influence, the influence which they were building after 1989 where they assumed a new identity of an elite of a new state. So this influence is still strong. This is what I can say.And let me assure you of one thing: that freedom of speech is absolutely respected in Poland. Poland absolutely respects all constitutional standards, just as in the United States: the right to assemble; the right to the freedom of speech. There is free media in Poland. There is everything that is functioning in a normal democracy.One can announce what they think, one can demonstrate, one can say what they think. In Poland, people are not attacked during demonstrations as it happens in other Western European countries. Police do not use truncheons or tear gas against people. People can speak their mind. They can express that they're not pleased with something. This is their right in democracy.Please ask Polish journalists, When was the last time\u2014when was the last demonstration in Poland when some kind of tension happened? No, it didn't, because in Poland we respect the right to demonstrate and to express your concern, because we believe that this is one of the foundations of democracy. In Poland, there is absolutely free and just elections. All the standards are respected.So, please, ladies and gentleman, come to Poland and see Poland with your own eyes. Please do not repeat certain stereotypes that are repeated in the West. Poland, today, has got quite a conservative government, that is true. And this government has got certain standards of action. Not everybody subscribes to those standards, especially people of more leftist views. But this is the nature of democracy.So once you have got one side of the political scene in power, and then people make a different choice and another side of the political stage comes to power. There is nothing extraordinary about that. And this is the change that is happening in Poland.But when somebody wins the elections, they then have the right to implement the program which they announced before the elections. Excuse me, however, realizing that implementing the program, which you presented in your election campaign, is not only the right, but I think an obligation resting on a politician. And this is exactly what is happening in Poland.Visa Waiver Program\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nIs that something that President Trump supports?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

And, President Duda, if I could just throw one your way as well: You said in the Oval Office earlier that democracy in Poland was strong. Not all of your European Union counterparts agree with that. How is forcing Supreme Court justices to retire early consistent with democratic principles? And, President Trump, is that something that you support?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNo. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very complex issue. And it's hard to answer this question because a lot of people in Western Europe\u2014I think also in the U.S.\u2014do not fully understand this problem because they have not grown up in a country such as mine.I was born in 1972, in a Poland which was in the Russian sphere of influence, in which a career could be made only, actually, when somebody enrolled as member of the Communist Party and who followed these people's power who was the supreme authority. And this is what was happening for many years.Although, as you know, ladies and gentlemen, as Solidarity movement grew, people were imprisoned, people were tortured, people were killed during the martial law, and after as well\u2014be it openly or in a secret way. And this was the reality of Poland until 1989.And now imagine, ladies and gentlemen, that no so long ago\u2014a few years ago\u2014I was surprised to discover that, in the Polish Supreme Court, there was a whole group of justices who were issuing sentencing as judges\u2014members of the Communist Party\u2014before 1990, who were even passing sentences during the martial law, sentencing people to prisons based on the law of the Communist martial law.And when I was asked whether the Supreme Court needs to be reformed, I said yes. If Poland is supposed to be a truly democratic, free, and sovereign country, if it is supposed to be a country we want it to be for our children, for the generation who was born after, in 1989, then for God's sake, those people have to leave. They have to retire. And this is what we did.As a matter of fact, everything that we were doing was aimed at retiring those people.

Thank you, Mr. President.[At this point, the reporter spoke in Polish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]Mr. President, the visa waiver program appeared on many occasions but then it did not come into practice.

I'm optimistic about that because I think this is the first U.S. administration which has treated this problem in such a serious way and in such a comprehensive way. So, both.When we talk with Mr. President, we\u2014the President expresses his deep care about that. Also, when I talk with President, Mosbacher\u2014the U.S. Ambassador to Warsaw\u2014she looks at the problem all the time. And I firmly believe that, in accordance with the law binding the United States\u2014because this is something that I want to stress very strongly\u2014according to the law, binding in the United States, by all the actions which are necessary in this respect such as today's signing of the agreement on preventing and committing serious crimes, I believe that, through all these sanctions, this visa waiver program\u2014covering Poles with visa waiver program\u2014is going to be possible soon. Anyway, that it is going to be possible before the end of the first term of President Donald Trump. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

[Inaudible]\u2014what do you say to him?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I don't know Jeremy Corbyn. Never met him. Never spoke to him. He wanted to meet today or tomorrow, and I decided that I would not do that. I think that he is\u2014from where I come from\u2014somewhat of a negative force. I think that the people should look to do things correctly as opposed to criticize. I really don't like critics as much as I like and respect people that get things done. So I've decided not to meet.As far as the protests, I have to tell you, because I commented on it yesterday: We left the Prime Minister, the Queen, the Royal Family; there were thousands of people on the streets cheering. And even coming over today, there were thousands of people cheering. And then, I heard that there were protests. I said: Where are the protests? I don't see any protests. I did see a small protest today when I came, very small. So a lot of it is fake news, I hate to say. But you saw the people waving the American flag, waving your flag; it was tremendous spirit and love. There was great love. It was an alliance. And I didn't see the protesters until just a little while ago, and it was a very, very small group of people, put in for political reasons. So it was fake news. Thank you.. And I would say to both the mayor of London and to Jeremy Corbyn: The discussions that we have had today are about the future of this most important relationship between the U.S. and the U.K.As the President described it: the greatest alliance the world has seen. It is this deep, special relationship and partnership between the United States and the United Kingdom that ensures our safety and security, and the safety and security of others around the world too. And it is this relationship that helps to ensure there are jobs that employ people here in the U.K. and in the United States that underpins our prosperity and our future. That is a relationship we should cherish. It is a relationship we should build on. It is a relationship we should be proud of.Mr. President, would you like to\u2014\u2014 It's very big, and this really is a very big and important alliance. And I think people should act positively toward it, because it means so much for both countries. It means so much and it's been so good.Steve Holland [Steve A. Holland, Reuters], yes.

This is a great, great country, and it wants its own identity. It wants to have its own borders. It wants to run its own affairs. This is a very, very special place. And I think it deserves a special place. And I thought maybe for that reason\u2014and for others\u2014but that reason, it was going to happen.Yes, I think it will happen, and I believe the Prime Minister has brought it to a very good point where something will take place in the not-too-distant future. I think she's done a very good job. I believe it would be good for the country, yes.. And from my point of view, I believe it is important for us to deliver Brexit. We gave that choice to the British people. Parliament overwhelmingly gave the choice to the British people. We should now deliver on that choice. I continue to believe that, actually, it's in the best interests of the U.K. to leave the European Union in an orderly way with a deal. I think we have a good deal. Sadly, the Labour Party and other MPs have, so far, stopped us from delivering Brexit and that deal.But we will\u2014but obviously, this is an issue that is going to continue here in the U.K. I think the important thing is we deliver Brexit.

If I could just follow up on a related matter: Mr. President, are you prepared to impose limits on intelligence-sharing with Britain if they do not put in place some restrictions on Huawei?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNo, because we're going to have absolutely an agreement on Huawei and everything else. We have an incredible intelligence relationship, and we will be able to work out any differences. I think we're not going to have it. We did discuss it. I see absolutely no limitations. We've never had limitations. This is a truly great ally and partner, and we'll have no problem with that. Okay?. Thank you.

And what do you think of Republicans who say that they make take action to block you imposing those tariffs?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nOh, I don't think they will do that. I think if they do, it's foolish. There's nothing more important than borders. I've had tremendous Republican support. I have a 90-percent\u201494-percent approval rating, as of this morning, in the Republican Party. That's an alltime record. Can you believe that? Isn't that something? I love records. [] But we have a 94-percent approval rating in the Republican Party.I want to see security at our border. I'm going to see great trade. I'm going to see a lot of things happening. And that is happening.And as you know, Mexico called. They want to meet. They're going to meet on Wednesday. Secretary Pompeo is going to be at the meeting, along with a few others that are very good at this. And we are going to see if we can do something.But I think it's more likely that the tariffs go on. And we'll probably be talking during the time that the tariffs are on and they're going to be paid. And if they don't step up and give us security for our Nation\u2014look, millions of people are flowing through Mexico. That's unacceptable. Millions and millions of people are coming right through Mexico. It's a 2,000-mile journey. And they're coming up to our border.And our Border Patrol, which is incredible, they're apprehending them, but our laws are bad, because the Democrats don't want to pass laws that could be passed in 15 minutes, that could be passed quickly. In 1 day, it could change.But even beyond the laws, Mexico shouldn't allow millions of people to try and enter our country. And they could stop it very quickly, and I think they will. And if they won't, we're going to put tariffs on. And every month, those tariffs go from 5 percent, to 10 percent, to 15 percent, to 20, and then to 25 percent. And what will happen then is, all of those companies that have left our country and gone to Mexico are going to be coming back to us. And that's okay. That's okay.But I think Mexico will step up and do what they should have been done. And I don't want to hear that Mexico is run by the cartels and the drug lords and the coyotes. I don't want to hear about that. A lot of people are saying that. Mexico has something to prove. But I don't want to hear that they're run by the cartels. You understand. You report on it all the time. A lot of people do. That would be a terrible thing.Mexico should step up and stop this onslaught, this invasion into our country, John.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat do you think of Republicans who say that they may take action to block you imposing those tariffs?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Mr. President, Prime Minister. Mr. President, I hope you'll indulge me with two questions since we're far from home. The first one is: So if Kim Jong Un is not violating his promise to you by firing small weapons, as you said in your tweet yesterday, what would you consider a violation exactly?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, let me say that I think that Kim Jong Un, or Chairman Kim, as some people say, is looking to create a nation that has great strength economically. I think he's very much\u2014I talk to him a lot about it, and he's very much into the fact that\u2014he believes, like I do, that North Korea has tremendous economic potential like perhaps few other developing nations anywhere in the world.And I think that he is looking to develop that way. He knows that, with nuclear, that's never going to happen. Only bad can happen. He understands that. He is a very smart man. He gets it well.So I think that he is going to try, at some point. I'm in no rush at all. The sanctions remain. We have our hostages back. We, as you know, are getting the remains, continuing to get the remains. A lot of good things are happening.And, very importantly, there's been no nuclear testing for 2 years. I looked at a chart the other day. During the past administration, there were many numbers that were very high, like 10 and 12 and 18, having to do with missile launches and nuclear testing. And for the last 2 years, on the bottom, it had zero and zero. So I am very happy with the way it's going. And intelligent people agree with me.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat would the president consider a violation of Kim Jong Un's promise?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you. One more question, Mr. President. Last week, you declared that you won't work with Democrats in Congress until they stop investigating you. So how are you going to explain to your voters when it comes at the expense of some of the promises that you made to them?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, there's never been a President more transparent. The Mueller report came out: no obstruction, no collusion. No nothing. It's a beautiful report.The Democrats cannot understand what happened. They really thought they had some people on their side, because, as you know, the people doing the investigation were 18 extremely angry Democrats, many of whom worked for Hillary Clinton and supported Hillary Clinton.And Bob Mueller, I guess you could say, he wasn't a friend of mine, but he did something that was really the right thing to do. They were very disappointed. They can't get over the fact that\u2014never spoke to Russia, never dealt with Russia, having to do with the subject we're talking about.And I will say this: That without question, we have done a job like few Presidents have done. The only thing you can say about me, that some people may not like, is that I've created one of the greatest economies anywhere in the world. In fact, when I first met with, yesterday\u2014with Prime Minister Abe, the first thing he did was congratulate me on the incredible economy that we have in the United States. So I think that we will work with them. We have a USMCA. We have a deal with Canada and Mexico that everybody wants, I think. It's all done. And I think they probably want to be doing that.As you know, Ambassador Lighthizer is here, right now. That's a deal that's gotten universal praise. Unions love it. Farmers love it. Manufacturers love it. You won't have companies leaving and going to Mexico and going to Canada and going like they were for many, many years. It's a great deal. I would imagine that Nancy Pelosi will approve that. I would think it would be very hard not to, but we'll see.But certainly, as things get approved I would love to sign them. It's only good for our country. I'm only interested in what's good for our country. It's very important.

Thank you, sir. I'm going to follow Vivian's lead and ask two questions, if I can. First is a follow-up on trade. Can you lay out specifically, Mr. President, what Japan needs to do to avoid auto tariffs? And before you come back to the G-20 in another month or so, do you expect talks with China to get back on track this year at all?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nFirst of all, getting to the G-20, I think that we are very much discussing different things with Japan. We have an unbelievably large imbalance\u2014as you know, trade imbalance\u2014which has been there for many, many years; Japan having the big advantage. They are brilliant businesspeople, brilliant negotiators, and put us in a very tough spot. But I think we will have a deal with Japan.Likewise, I think we will have a deal with China sometime into the future. Many companies are leaving China right now because of the tariffs. China is subsidizing a lot of industry because\u2014you know, foolishly, some people said that the American taxpayer is paying the tariffs of China. No, no, no\u2014it's not that way. They're paying a small percentage, but our country is taking in billions and billions of dollars.Our farmers\u2014out of all of that money, the tens of billions of dollars\u2014we're giving a relatively small percentage to our farmers, who have really been a focal point of what's gone on with trade. As you know, they've earmarked, and they've gone after the farmer, thinking that if they hurt the farmer, I'm going to negotiate a bad deal for the rest of the country.I'll tell you, the American farmer, these are patriots. These are great patriots. They don't want subsidy. We've had meetings\u2014and I've had meetings with 32, 35, 40 farmers at one time, numerous times. And they don't want subsidy. I've told that to you before, Jeff. They want a level playing field. That's all they want, because they're better than anybody in the world.And they've told me. I said, You know, I'm going to get you subsidy while China takes advantage of us and China takes advantage of you, by pinpointing you. They say: We don't want subsidies, sir. All we want is a laying play\u2014really, a level playing field.The American farmer, these are great patriots. They are unbelievable people. And they're with me, a hundred percent. I believe that we will have a very good deal with China sometime into the future, because I don't believe that China can continue to pay these, really, hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. I don't believe they can do that.You know, businesses are leaving China by the hundreds, by the thousands, going into areas that are nontariffed, including the United States, by the way. But they're going to different parts of Asia: Vietnam; frankly, Japan. But they're going to a lot of places, but they're also coming to the United States, because people don't want to pay the tariff.And if you look, there is no tariff to pay. All you have to do is move your company to the United States. There is no 25-percent tariff.But with all of that being said, I think that there's a very good chance that the United States and China will have a very good trade deal.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo you expect talks with China to get back on track this year?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

There have been no ballistic missiles going out. There have been no long-range missiles going out. And I think that someday we'll have a deal. I'm not in a rush.

But in terms of criticism that you're, sort of, supporting a dictator instead of an American Vice President?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, when I look at what's been done by our Vice President and the President, when I look at the horrible Iran deal that they made, look what happened since I terminated the Iran deal. Look what has happened to Iran.Iran, when I first came into office, was a terror. They were fighting in many locations all over the Middle East. They were behind every single major attack, whether it was Syria, whether it was Yemen, whether it was individual, smaller areas, whether it was taking away oil from people. They were involved with everything.Now they're pulling back, because they're got serious economic problems. We have massive\u2014as you know, massive sanctions and other things. I mean, we just said the other day: steel, copper, different elements of what they used to sell. The oil is essentially dried up. And I'm not looking that\u2014to hurt Iran at all. I'm looking to have Iran say, No nuclear weapons. We have enough problems in this world right now with nuclear weapons. No nuclear weapons for Iran.And I think we'll make a deal. I think Iran\u2014again, I think Iran has tremendous economic potential. And I look forward to letting them get back to the stage where they can show that. I think Iran\u2014I know so many people from Iran. These are great people. It has a chance to be a great country, with the same leadership. We're not looking for regime change. I just want to make that clear. We're looking for no nuclear weapons.If you look at the deal that Biden and President Obama signed, they would have access\u2014free access\u2014to nuclear weapons, where they wouldn't even be in violation, in just a very short period of time. What kind of a deal is that?So we can't have that. Plus, there were many other things they did that were very bad. So I don't take sides as to who I'm in favor or who I'm not, but I can tell you that Joe Biden was a disaster. His administration, with President Obama, they were basically a disaster when it came to so many things, whether it was economy, whether it was military, defense. No matter what it was, they had a lot problems. So I'm not a fan.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nBut in terms of criticism that you're, sort of, supporting a dictator instead of an American Vice President?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

But we can go a lot tougher if we need to do that.But it's a very sad thing, and we're not looking for anything other than taking care of a lot of people that are starving and dying in the streets.

Therefore, these reserved issues, which may be discussed if they have not yet, will not become public, evidently.I remember on a debate here in the United States when a candidate asked another candidate what he would do to fight the Islamic State. He said, If I say, I will no longer be able to beat it. So it's a matter of strategy.

I've been telling everybody: They have tremendous potential. Unbelievable potential. But we're going to see.But it was about sanctions.

Two questions, if I may. First, did you learn anything new about Chairman Kim through this meeting?And secondly, of course, while this was going on, the drama back in Washington, your former lawyer, Michael Cohen\u2014who worked for you for 10 years; his office right next to yours, right by yours at Trump Tower\u2014he called you a liar, a conman, a racist. What's your response to Michael Cohen?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, it's incorrect. And you know, it's very interesting, because I tried to watch as much as I could. I wasn't able to watch too much because I've been a little bit busy. But I think having a fake hearing like that and having it in the middle of this very important summit is really a terrible thing. They could've made it 2 days later or next week, and it would've been even better. They would've had more time.But having it during this very important summit is sort of incredible. And he lied a lot, but it was very interesting, because he didn't lie about one thing. He said no collusion with the Russian hoax. And I said, I wonder why he didn't just lie about that, too, like he did about everything else?I mean, he lied about so many different things, and I was actually impressed that he didn't say, Well, I think there was collusion for this reason or that. He didn't say that. He said, No collusion. And I was, you know, a little impressed by that, frankly. Could've\u2014he could've gone all out. He only went about 95 percent instead of 100 percent.But the fact is, there is no collusion. And I call it the witch hunt. This should never happen to another President. This is so bad for our country. So bad. You look at this whole hoax, it's a\u2014I call it the Russian witch hunt and now add the word hoax. It's a very, very bad thing for our country. But I was impressed with the fact that he\u2014when\u2014you know, because the most important question up there was the one on collusion. And he said he saw no collusion. So we'll see what happens.
