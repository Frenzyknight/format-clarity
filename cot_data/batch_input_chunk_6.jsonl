Thank you, Mr. President. The President. Thank you.Hong Kong/China  Q. I would like to ask your opinion about what recently happened in Hong Kong, the recent attack on press freedom in Hong Kong. And Jimmy Lai was arrested; his newsroom was raided. What\u2014how will the U.S. respond to this?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I think it's a terrible thing. But one thing that we have done\u2014you know, we gave tremendous incentives to Hong Kong because of freedom. We want freedom. And we were giving tremendous economic incentives to Hong Kong. And we have now withdrawn all of those incentives, and it will be impossible for Hong Kong to compete with the United States with respect to that. It just won't be, because we've taken all of the incentives away.If you look at China\u2014with the World Trade Organization, as an example\u2014they're getting tremendous, because they're considered a developing nation, which is ridiculous. Why should they be a developing nation, but we're not? And they get tremendous incentives.We have\u2014by the way, I told them it's unacceptable, and we've been doing that for a long time. They understand exactly how we feel, and big changes are being made. But with respect to Hong Kong, they get tremendous financial incentives so that they could do business and compete in the world.We've now withdrawn all of those incentives. It's going to be very hard for Hong Kong to compete. And I will tell you that the United States\u2014and I say this from any standpoint you want to hear it\u2014will end up making a lot more money because of it. Because we lost a lot of business to Hong Kong. We made it very convenient for people to go there, for companies to go there. We've withdrawn all of that. And the United States will be a big beneficiary from an economic standpoint, but I hate to see what happened to Hong Kong, because freedom is a great thing.Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow will the U.S. respond to these events?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to highlight a kind of odd situation. In the last hour or so, if you Googled antifa.com, it would take you straight to Joe Biden's website, his official campaign website. Odd situation. We don't know who's behind that.But it raises an interesting leadership question: Should Joe Biden, the Democrat Party, Kamala Harris\u2014should they publicly denounce the Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThey should. I think they're afraid to. It's\u2014in my book it's virtually a part of their campaign: Antifa. The Democrats act like Gee I don't know exactly what that is. Take a look at Portland. Take a look at any place you want to take a look at and they're all over the place. They were here. We put on a 10-year prison sentence if you knocked down any statues 2 months ago. And since then we haven't seen much of them.We had to send border security\u2014and we sent actually Homeland and Border and different forms of Homeland to Portland in order to\u2014you know what we had to do. We had to save\u2014they wanted to knock down a courthouse\u2014a $500 million courthouse\u2014they wanted to burn it down knock it down. And they were easily able to defend. But the mayor and the Governor of the State they didn't want to do that.And we actually sent our people there and they did a great job. And they were\u2014they did it easily. But in the meantime they went to other parts of the city and they're doing damage. And we're recommending to the Governor that they call in national security call in the National Guard. We're willing to get\u2014we would stop that problem in one hour.We sent just defensive measures to protect and save that courthouse from being burned down or knocked down. We also saved a couple of other buildings\u2014Federal buildings\u2014because they were unable to do the job.I have to say this: They have really good police. They have a great group of people that if they would be allowed to do their job\u2014same with Chicago and same with New York and a couple of other cities\u2014if they allowed\u2014you have in Chicago 25000 police and they're really good but they're not allowed to do their job.In New York you have New York's Finest but they've totally taken away their incentive. They've taken away their lives in a sense because they don't allow them to do their job. They could do that job so easily; you wouldn't have a problem in New York. And that includes with terrorism and everything else. They disbanded\u2014they've cut by $1 billion their budget in New York. One billion dollars. And crime is up by 200 percent 250 percent depends on what week you're looking at. It's crazy what's going on in New York.We could solve that problem easily but we don't have to because they should be able to do it themselves. But they have to give the honor back. It's the\u2014it's an honor. They have to give the honor back to their law enforcement groups. New York is great; so is Chicago. And in Portland they could do the job. If they don't want to do that we would send in\u2014gladly if they want\u2014the National Guard will take care of it in 1 hour. It will go very quickly.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nShould Joe Biden, the Democrat Party, Kamala Harris\u2014should they publicly denounce the Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Other countries\u2014we're doing much better than all other major countries peer countries. This chart came out just a little while ago. I thought I'd say\u2014see it's that kind of a question\u2014a wise-guy question\u2014because I just went over the whole thing. We're doing better than almost everyone with the economy. And I think we're\u2014you know we face a headwind because Democrats perhaps for political reasons don't want to open up their States. And that's having a huge toll\u2014that's taking a huge toll on people within those States.When you look at North Carolina you have\u2014a man doesn't want to open it up. You have\u2014you look at Michigan you look at some States\u2014I mean they just want to keep these people in their houses in their prisons. They call them prisons. And I think a lot of it is for political reasons because they want to look as bad as possible on November 3. But I don't think it's going to matter because we're doing so well in so many ways.As far as the plague is concerned when you look at the numbers take a look at what's going on now with other countries they're having flare-ups that are very very substantial and we've done very well. We're helping a lot of those countries. And those were model countries that you used to talk about and say how well they were doing except they just exploded. They just had very big flare-ups. You understand that. No we're doing very well. And I don't have to show you the charts again but those charts are at a level that nobody even thought possible.I think we're going to have a fantastic third quarter. I think next year will be one of the strongest years we've had. And this is with California being closed down.

Thanks, Mr. President. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris just appeared together in their first campaign event, right before you've got up on this podium. Can you tell us if you watched their remarks and give us your reaction to them?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI didn't watch. I saw just a moment of him speaking a moment of her speaking and it was enough.Look he made a choice: He picked her. I watched her. I watched her poll numbers go boom boom boom down to almost nothing. And she left angry. She left mad. There was nobody more insulting to Biden than she was. She said horrible things about him including accusations made about him by a woman where she I guess believed the woman. And now all of a sudden she's running to be Vice President saying how wonderful he is.I thought it was a very unusual pick because she said such bad things. And you know better than anybody what\u2014you know you won't write it because you know you don't want to do that\u2014but you know better than anybody. She said horrible things about him. Horrible things. And she mocked him openly mocked him. That's why I thought that was a very risky pick because I'm sure that'll be played back\u2014not necessarily by me but others\u2014it will be played back.The other thing if you look she wants a $3 trillion tax hike. No fracking. How do you think no fracking in Pennsylvania is going to play? That's a big fracking State. If you didn't have energy produced that way you would have taxes that would triple and you'd have unemployment that you wouldn't believe.And Pennsylvania last year had the best year they've ever had. Texas last year had the best year they've ever had. Oklahoma best year. Almost every State in our Nation last year had the best year they've ever had. And they're going to have that again next year. And you can see that by what\u2014but think of it: She wants no fossil fuels. No fossil fuels. Really? Tell that to Texas.And then I hear Trump is only one point up in Texas. No they said the same thing with Crooked Hillary Clinton. They said: Texas is in play. Trump is down in Texas. And then I won Texas. Immediately when they said the polls are closed Trump has won Texas. And I won by a lot. And I won Georgia by a lot. It's the same thing over\u2014it's almost like a duplication of what happened before except we have much more energy now than we ever did in 2016 and we had a lot. We had record amounts in 2016.But you take a look at the tax cuts. We gave the biggest tax cut in the history of our country and the biggest regulation cuts in the history of our country by far. Right? He wants to increase everybody's taxes. And she's one of the people that wants that.I mean you take a look at that. She wants to defund or at least substantially reduce money going to police departments. And you can't do that. You can't do that. It's actually got to be the opposite. I've been endorsed by so many police departments. I'm getting a really good one this week that you'll be seeing really big really good.But who could ever\u2014what police department what law enforcement group could ever support Joe Biden where he said things that are so bad and so foolish\u2014frankly so stupid\u2014in terms of crime and what would happen. So we're getting all of law enforcement.We're getting the military. She wants to spend much less on our military. I've rebuilt the military. We have the strongest military now. Much of the equipment is coming in all made in the United States; $2.5 trillion we spent.When I took over we had a military that was totally\u2014it was in terrible terrible shape. It was depleted. It was a depleted military: old planes old tanks old everything. And we have a beautiful brandnew military with the best people in the world. We never had anything like it. Some of the equipment is still coming in.No we have\u2014we've done a real job. And I think we're going to be extremely successful. I was surprised that he picked her\u2014very surprised\u2014because of the horrible way she talked about him. And frankly because she dropped like a rock.I didn't when I ran. I ran against 17 people mostly Governors and Senators some others. Ben Carson was very strong very good. A couple of others but mostly Governors mostly Senators. And I ran and I went up.She ran and she went down to rock bottom. I don't think she ever got to run her first\u2014to take a vote in her first\u2014in the first State. And so generally speaking you don't want to pick somebody that went down and she went down. But she went down in a very terrible way and she said horrible things about Biden.She said far worse about Biden than I ever did. And now she's running as Vice President. So how does that work?Please in the back.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nCan you tell us if you watched their remarks and give us your reaction to them?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

What exactly do you mean by invasion?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWhat I mean is people are going to become\u2014they are going to be opening up areas of your neighborhood\u2014which they're doing and now they're going to do\u2014they wanted to expand it. And they will expand it. If for any reason\u2014they're going to in my opinion destroy suburbia.And just so you understand 30 percent-plus of the people living in suburbia are minorities. African American Asian American Hispanic American\u2014they're minorities. Thirty percent. The number is even higher it's\u2014they say 35 but I like to cut it a little bit lower. You know why? That way I can never get myself in too much trouble with the fake news. But 30 percent-plus are minorities living in suburbia.And when they go in and they want to change zoning so that you have lots of problems where they want to build low-income housing\u2014you want something where people can aspire to be there not something where it gets hurt badly. And that's what happens.So with suburban women suburban men I think they feel very strongly about what I'm doing. It's a very\u2014I mean it's a very fair question. It's a very important question. But they fought all their lives to be there and then all of a sudden they have\u2014something happened that changes their life and changes what they fought for for so many years.John [John Roberts Fox News] please.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat exactly do you mean by invasion?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

That includes China. That includes every country in the world. We've done more testing. We have better testing than any country in the world. They call; they want to know: Where do we get it? How do we get it? We have better testing than any country in the world.When you do as much testing as us however as you understand you develop more cases.

We've done the best job of any country in the world and that includes from making ventilators that nobody else could have done. We are the ventilator king of the world. We're supplying the whole world now in a few short months with ventilators that are very hard to produce very expensive very complex very delicate very very important.

The Justice Department IG has found out, with the Carter Page foreign application. But we were actually warned in 2013 that the Surveillance Court was, allegedly, a rubber stamp. It was approving surveillance.And I was wondering: I don't think, as President, you've commented on Edward Snowden, but do you think he should be allowed to return without going to prison?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nSo as far FISA abuse is concerned, there was tremendous FISA abuse. It's amazing that it's taken this long. And everyone knows that it's been proven very substantially. Not only FISA abuse, changing documents and putting documents in front of the FISA Court and courts that are disgraceful that they could have done it.And the fact is we caught Joe Biden, President Obama, the whole group. You can look at Brennan and Comey and Clapper, the whole group. We caught them spying on our campaign. This was an illegal act like no other illegal act. This was treason. This was at the highest level of treason. And Obama and Biden got caught spying on my campaign, using intelligence agencies of the United States Government to do it, both before and after the election. So before the election and then after I won, they continued. It's totally illegal activity, and now we just have to see what's happening.But as far as Kamala is concerned, she's a big tax raiser, she's a big slasher of funds for our military, and she's got a lot of difficult things that she's going to have to explain. Plus, she was very, very nasty to\u2014one of the reasons it surprised me, she was very\u2014she was probably nastier than even Pocahontas to Joe Biden. She was very disrespectful to Joe Biden. And it's hard to pick somebody that's that disrespectful. When she said things during the debates\u2014during the Democrat primary debates\u2014that were horrible about Sleepy Joe. And I would think that he wouldn't have picked.OAN, please. Please.

Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday Seattle City Council voted to cut funding for their police department, and the chief\u2014the police chief there, Carmen Best, the first Black woman to serve in that capacity\u2014she resigned hours later. What does this say about our country? And what does this say about the defund police movement?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I think that Seattle, in spite of all that they've been through, with the embarrassment of having a radical left group\u2014Antifa and others\u2014take over a big portion of the city of Seattle\u2014we're talking about a big city, a major city. That they allowed that to happen is incredible. That it took so long to fix is incredible. And the only reason they went in is because they knew we were going in the following day, and so they preceded us. They didn't want that to happen. They don't want to be embarrassed. And the people just gave up. They weren't\u2014they were exhausted from having taken over a city for so long.The police commissioner seems like a very good woman. They were going to slash her salary by 40 or 50 percent. And they cut a tremendous amount off the police department, really, where people are saying it's not sustainable as a good police department. And, again, those police are good also, but they're not allowed to do their job.So I think it's a shame. I hate to see her go, because she did, in her own way, a very good job, but she wasn't effective in convincing the mayor and the city council to give the funds that were needed or just leave the funds the way they are.They've done a big\u2014a big defund, a big part of it. And it will probably get worse before people realize this is a tragic error, before people start dying and getting hurt very badly. So I think Seattle has made a tragic mistake. I think Portland has no clue as to what they're doing. They have no clue. And hopefully, there'll be asking for help, because we can solve their problem very, very quickly.Yes, go ahead.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat does this say about the defund police movement?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

And what does this say about the defund police movement?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I think that Seattle, in spite of all that they've been through, with the embarrassment of having a radical left group\u2014Antifa and others\u2014take over a big portion of the city of Seattle\u2014we're talking about a big city, a major city. That they allowed that to happen is incredible. That it took so long to fix is incredible. And the only reason they went in is because they knew we were going in the following day, and so they preceded us. They didn't want that to happen. They don't want to be embarrassed. And the people just gave up. They weren't\u2014they were exhausted from having taken over a city for so long.The police commissioner seems like a very good woman. They were going to slash her salary by 40 or 50 percent. And they cut a tremendous amount off the police department, really, where people are saying it's not sustainable as a good police department. And, again, those police are good also, but they're not allowed to do their job.So I think it's a shame. I hate to see her go, because she did, in her own way, a very good job, but she wasn't effective in convincing the mayor and the city council to give the funds that were needed or just leave the funds the way they are.They've done a big\u2014a big defund, a big part of it. And it will probably get worse before people realize this is a tragic error, before people start dying and getting hurt very badly. So I think Seattle has made a tragic mistake. I think Portland has no clue as to what they're doing. They have no clue. And hopefully, there'll be asking for help, because we can solve their problem very, very quickly.Yes, go ahead.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat does the resignation of Seattle's police chief and the decision to cut funding for the police department say about our country?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, Mr. President. In Ohio, a few days ago, you said, quote, Joe Biden has hurt God; he's against God. The Vice President has said that he's a man of deep Catholic faith, and he has credited it for helping him endure some immense personal tragedy. So, sir, what did you mean by that, when you said that Joe Biden has hurt God or is against God?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, if you look at the manifesto that that they've come up with, and if you look at their stance on religion and things having to do, very importantly, with aspects of religion and faith: I don't think a man of deep religion would be agreeing to the Bernie Sanders plan. You take a look at what they have in, and you just\u2014you can't put that into the realm of a religious group of people, I will say that.And I think it's one of the reasons why, if you look at polls, which\u2014I'm not a big believer in polls. I wouldn't\u2014if I was, I guess I wouldn't be standing here right now.And by the way, our poll numbers are going up very rapidly, as you know, and Joe's are going down very rapidly. He'll have to come out of the basement, it looks like, pretty soon, because that\u2014you know, it's one of those things.But no, if you look at the manifesto\u2014I call it the manifesto. A lot of people are calling it a manifesto. My opinion: It's further left than where Bernie was before. So normally, he'd be left, and you'd bring it somewhere a little bit toward the center. But some of the things that they have down there\u2014and I'm not only talking in terms of religion; I'm not talking, even, in terms of religion\u2014but some of the things they have in the agreement made\u2014and this was an agreement made by Bernie Sanders and Joe\u2014it's a terrible thing. It would be a terrible thing for our country.It will destroy our country. We will go into a depression. We will put on regulation. We will double and triple taxes. We will\u2014it will be terrible for health care. Just terrible. You'll have 180 million people lose their healthcare. It will be a terrible, terrible thing for our country.Okay.

[Inaudible]\u2014if 160,000 people had died on President Obama's watch, do you think you would have called for his resignation?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNo, I wouldn't have done that. I think it's been amazing what we've been able to do. If we didn't close up our country, we would have had 1\u00bd or 2 million people already dead. We've called it right; now we don't have to close it. We understand the disease.Nobody understood it because nobody has ever seen anything like this. The closest thing is, in 1917, they say, right? The great pandemic certainly was a terrible thing, where they lost, anywhere from 50 to 100 million people. Probably ended the Second World War; all the soldiers were sick. That was a terrible situation. And this is highly contagious. This one is highly, highly contagious.No, if I would have listened to a lot of people, we would have kept it open. And by the way, we keep it open now, all the way. We keep it open. But we would have kept it open, and you could be up to a million and a half or 2 million people right now\u20141\u00bd to 2 million people.Our people have done a fantastic job, our consultants and our doctors. You know, and with disagreements and with a lot of things happening. What we've done with ventilators has been amazing. What we've done with medical equipment has been incredible. We've supplied the Governors. Nobody, not one person in this country that needed a ventilator didn't get it. And you know, at the beginning, there was a big shortage of ventilators. Nobody had stockpiles or anything comparable to what you had to have.So we would have lost\u2014if you think about it, you had mentioned 160,000 people. Multiply that times 10 right now. I think it would have been unsustainable and unacceptable. But that's what would have happened had we kept it open.So no, I think we're a very large country. We are\u2014one person\u2014and I say it all the time; a lot of people like to leave that out\u2014one person is too many. It should have never happened. But they've done a\u2014really, an extraordinary job. They'll never be given the credit\u2014and I'm not talking about me. The people that have worked on this so hard will never be given the credit, but they've done an extraordinary job with a very large, diverse country. Really, an extraordinary job.And a lot of the Governors who, as you know, they sort of do the micro in their States, and they go up, and I think I can tell you that a lot of the Governors have done an extraordinary job too.Yes, please go ahead.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nIf 160,000 people had died on President Obama's watch, do you think you would have called for his resignation?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

And, as a general point, what rate, then, would you want in there: a percentage or a flat rate?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWe are looking at it. We're also looking at various other things that I'm allowed to do under the system, and\u2014such as the payroll tax suspension. And so we're allowed to do things.We're talking with the Democrats. They seem to be much more interested in solving the problems of some of the Democrat-run States and cities that have suffered greatly through bad management. I mean, really bad management. So that seems to be where they're looking for a trillion dollars to help out with cities that are run by Democrats, in some cases, radical-left Democrats that have not done a good job.I appreciate\u2014today the Wall Street Journal said very good things\u2014that we did a great job in Portland by having our people go in. Homeland Security, Chad Wolf, and the folks\u2014we went into Portland, and we've done a great job. And they had that in an editorial, that we really won that situation. But we want the whole\u2014we did save the courthouse. The courthouse was going to be burned down or knocked down. It was in tremendous danger. We went in. We took care of it. And we appreciated what the Wall Street Journal said.As far as the various things that I may or may not sign: I may not have to sign. I mean, progress is being made, as you know very well, on the Hill. We'll see what happens. But I have the right\u2014including the payroll tax suspension. We may do some things.We want to take care of the eviction problem. People are being evicted very unfairly. It's not their fault. It's China's fault; it's not their fault. And people are being evicted, and we can do that with an Executive order. So if we don't get\u2014and we want to do it relatively quickly.I mean, even from the standpoint of COVID, people get evicted, and then they go into shelters, and there are thousands of people in the shelters. And this is not a time\u2014you never want to be in a shelter, but this is not a time to be in a shelter with the COVID. They catch it, they get it, and it's no good.So I may have to do something on evictions too, because the Democrats, amazingly, don't want to do it. We offered them short-term deals, and we offered them lots of alternatives. But so far, the only thing they really want to do is bail out States that have been poorly managed by Democrats.Okay. Please, go ahead.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat rate, then, would you want in there: a percentage or a flat rate?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}
