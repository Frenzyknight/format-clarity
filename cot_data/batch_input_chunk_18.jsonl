You're about to embark on your final foreign trip. What will you say to other world leaders about your successor? They've expressed many of the same misgivings that you have about Donald Trump. Should they be worried about the future of U.S. foreign policy? And separately, as Democrats scramble to regroup after a pretty shocking upset, what is your advice about where the party goes now? And who should lead your party?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nGood. One of the great things about the United States is that when it comes to world affairs, the President obviously is the leader of the executive branch, the Commander in Chief, the spokesperson for the Nation, but the influence and the work that we have is the result not just of the President. It is the result of countless interactions and arrangements and relationships between our military and other militaries and our diplomats and other diplomats and intelligence officers and development workers. And there is enormous continuity beneath the day-to-day news that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order and promoting prosperity around the world. That will continue. In my conversation with the President-elect, he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships. And so one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the transatlantic alliance. I think that's one of the most important functions I can serve at this stage, during this trip, is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America's commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO relationship and a recognition that those alliances aren't just good for Europe, they're good for the United States, and they're vital for the world.With respect to the Democratic Party, look, as I said in the Rose Garden right after the election, when your team loses, everybody gets deflated, and it's hard, and it's challenging. And so I think it's a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to go through some reflection. I think it's important for me not to be big-footing that conversation. I think we want to see new voices and new ideas emerge. That's part of the reason why I think term limits are a really useful thing.I think the Democrats should not waver on our core beliefs and principles: the belief that we should have an economy that works for everybody, not just a few; the belief that America, at its best, is inclusive and not exclusive, that we insist on the dignity and God-given potential and worth of every child, regardless of race or gender or sexual orientation or what ZIP Code they were born in. That we are committed to a world in which we keep America safe, but we recognize that our power doesn't just flow from our extraordinary military, it also flows from the strength of our ideals and our principles and our values.So there are going to be a core set of values that shouldn't be up for debate, should be our north star. But how we organize politically I think is something that we should spend some time thinking about. I believe that we have better ideas. But I also believe that good ideas don't matter if people don't hear them. And one of the issues that Democrats have to be clear on is that, given population distribution across the country, we have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere. We have to work at a grassroots level, something that's been a running thread in my career.I won Iowa not because the demographics dictated that I would win Iowa, it was because I spent 87 days going to every small town and fair and fish fry and VFW hall. And there were some counties where I might have lost, but maybe I lost by 20 points instead of 50 points. There are some counties maybe I won that people didn't expect because people had a chance to see you and listen to you and get a sense of who you stood for and who you were fighting for.And the challenge for a national party is, how do you dig in there and create those kinds of structures so that people have a sense of what it is that you stand for? And that increasingly is difficult to do just through a national press strategy. It's increasingly difficult to do because of the splintering of the press.And so I think the discussions that have been taking place about how do you build more grassroots organizing, how do you build up State parties and local parties and schoolboard elections you're paying attention to and State rep races and city council racesthat all, I think, will contribute to stronger outcomes in the future.And I'm optimistic that will happen. And Ifor Democrats who are feeling completely discouraged, I've been trying to remind them everybody remembers my Boston speech in 2004; they may not remember me showing up here in 2005 when John Kerry had lost a close election, Tom Daschle, the leader of the Senate, had been beaten in an upset. Ken Salazar and I were the only two Democrats that won nationally. Republicans controlled the Senate and the House. And 2 years later, Democrats were winning back Congress, and 4 years later, I was President of the United States.Things change pretty rapidly. But it doesn'tthey don't change inevitably. They change because you work for it. Nobody said democracy is supposed to be easy. This is hard. And in a big country like this, it probably should be hard.Mark Knoller [ABC News].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat is your advice about where the party goes now?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

And Ifor Democrats who are feeling completely discouraged, I've been trying to remind them everybody remembers my Boston speech in 2004; they may not remember me showing up here in 2005 when John Kerry had lost a close election, Tom Daschle, the leader of the Senate, had been beaten in an upset. Ken Salazar and I were the only two Democrats that won nationally. Republicans controlled the Senate and the House. And 2 years later, Democrats were winning back Congress, and 4 years later, I was President of the United States.Things change pretty rapidly. But it doesn'tthey don't change inevitably. They change because you work for it. Nobody said democracy is supposed to be easy. This is hard.

You're about to embark on your final foreign trip. What will you say to other world leaders about your successor? They've expressed many of the same misgivings that you have about Donald Trump. Should they be worried about the future of U.S. foreign policy? And separately, as Democrats scramble to regroup after a pretty shocking upset, what is your advice about where the party goes now? And who should lead your party?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nGood. One of the great things about the United States is that when it comes to world affairs, the President obviously is the leader of the executive branch, the Commander in Chief, the spokesperson for the Nation, but the influence and the work that we have is the result not just of the President. It is the result of countless interactions and arrangements and relationships between our military and other militaries and our diplomats and other diplomats and intelligence officers and development workers. And there is enormous continuity beneath the day-to-day news that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order and promoting prosperity around the world. That will continue. In my conversation with the President-elect, he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships. And so one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the transatlantic alliance. I think that's one of the most important functions I can serve at this stage, during this trip, is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America's commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO relationship and a recognition that those alliances aren't just good for Europe, they're good for the United States, and they're vital for the world.With respect to the Democratic Party, look, as I said in the Rose Garden right after the election, when your team loses, everybody gets deflated, and it's hard, and it's challenging. And so I think it's a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to go through some reflection. I think it's important for me not to be big-footing that conversation. I think we want to see new voices and new ideas emerge. That's part of the reason why I think term limits are a really useful thing.I think the Democrats should not waver on our core beliefs and principles: the belief that we should have an economy that works for everybody, not just a few; the belief that America, at its best, is inclusive and not exclusive, that we insist on the dignity and God-given potential and worth of every child, regardless of race or gender or sexual orientation or what ZIP Code they were born in. That we are committed to a world in which we keep America safe, but we recognize that our power doesn't just flow from our extraordinary military, it also flows from the strength of our ideals and our principles and our values.So there are going to be a core set of values that shouldn't be up for debate, should be our north star. But how we organize politically I think is something that we should spend some time thinking about. I believe that we have better ideas. But I also believe that good ideas don't matter if people don't hear them. And one of the issues that Democrats have to be clear on is that, given population distribution across the country, we have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere. We have to work at a grassroots level, something that's been a running thread in my career.I won Iowa not because the demographics dictated that I would win Iowa, it was because I spent 87 days going to every small town and fair and fish fry and VFW hall. And there were some counties where I might have lost, but maybe I lost by 20 points instead of 50 points. There are some counties maybe I won that people didn't expect because people had a chance to see you and listen to you and get a sense of who you stood for and who you were fighting for.And the challenge for a national party is, how do you dig in there and create those kinds of structures so that people have a sense of what it is that you stand for? And that increasingly is difficult to do just through a national press strategy. It's increasingly difficult to do because of the splintering of the press.And so I think the discussions that have been taking place about how do you build more grassroots organizing, how do you build up State parties and local parties and schoolboard elections you're paying attention to and State rep races and city council racesthat all, I think, will contribute to stronger outcomes in the future.And I'm optimistic that will happen.

Good to see you. Mr. President, what can you tell us about the learning curve on becoming President?

And did you discuss this matter with President-elect Trump?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nAbout a week ago, I started feeling pretty good. [] No, look, I think the learning curve always continues. This is a remarkable job. It is like no other job on Earth. And it is a constant flow of information and challenges and issues. That is truer now than it has ever been, partly because of the nature of information and the interconnection between regions of the world.If you were President 50 years ago, the tragedy in Syria might not even penetrate what the American people were thinking about on a day-to-day basis. Today, they're seeing vivid images of a child in the aftermath of a bombing. There was a time when if you had a financial crisis in Southeast Asia somewhere, it had no impact on our markets; today, it does.So the amount of information, the amount of incoming that any administration has to deal with today, and respond to much more rapidly than ever before, that makes it different. I was watching a documentary, that during the Bay of Pigs crisis, JFK had about 2 weeks before anybody reported on it. Imagine that. I think it's fair to say that if something like that happens under a current President, they've got to figure out in about an hour what their response is.So these are the kinds of points that I shared with the President-elect. It was a free-flowing and, I think, useful conversation. I hope it was. I tried to be as honest as I could about the things I think any President coming in needs to think about. And probably the most important point that I made was that how you staffparticularly your Chief of Staff, your National Security Adviser, your White House Counselhow you set up a process and a system to surface information, generate options for a President, understanding that, ultimately, the President is going to be the final decisionmaker, that that's something that has to be attended to right away.I have been blessed by havingand I admittedly am biasedsome of the smartest, hardest working, good people in my administration that I think any President has ever had. And as a consequence of that team, I've been able to make good decisions. And if you don't have that around you, then you'll get swamped. So I hope that he appreciated that advice.What I also discussed was the fact that I had been encouraged by his statements on election night about the need for unity and his interest in being the President for all people, and that how he staffs, the first steps he takes, the first impressions he makes, the reset that can happen after an electionall those things are important and should be thought about. And I think it's important to give him the room and the space to do that. It takes time to put that together.But I emphasized to him that, look, in an election like this that was so hotly contested and so divided, gestures matter. And how he reaches out to groups that may not have supported him, how he signals his interest in their issues or concerns, I think those are the kinds of things that can set a tone that will help move things forward once he's actually taken office.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nLearning curve on becoming President\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Good to see you. Mr. President, what can you tell us about the learning curve on becoming President? Is\u2014can you tell us how long it took you before you were fully at ease in the job, if that ever happens? And did you discuss this matter with President-elect Trump?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nAbout a week ago, I started feeling pretty good. [] No, look, I think the learning curve always continues. This is a remarkable job. It is like no other job on Earth. And it is a constant flow of information and challenges and issues. That is truer now than it has ever been, partly because of the nature of information and the interconnection between regions of the world.If you were President 50 years ago, the tragedy in Syria might not even penetrate what the American people were thinking about on a day-to-day basis. Today, they're seeing vivid images of a child in the aftermath of a bombing. There was a time when if you had a financial crisis in Southeast Asia somewhere, it had no impact on our markets; today, it does.So the amount of information, the amount of incoming that any administration has to deal with today, and respond to much more rapidly than ever before, that makes it different. I was watching a documentary, that during the Bay of Pigs crisis, JFK had about 2 weeks before anybody reported on it. Imagine that. I think it's fair to say that if something like that happens under a current President, they've got to figure out in about an hour what their response is.So these are the kinds of points that I shared with the President-elect. It was a free-flowing and, I think, useful conversation. I hope it was. I tried to be as honest as I could about the things I think any President coming in needs to think about. And probably the most important point that I made was that how you staffparticularly your Chief of Staff, your National Security Adviser, your White House Counselhow you set up a process and a system to surface information, generate options for a President, understanding that, ultimately, the President is going to be the final decisionmaker, that that's something that has to be attended to right away.I have been blessed by havingand I admittedly am biasedsome of the smartest, hardest working, good people in my administration that I think any President has ever had. And as a consequence of that team, I've been able to make good decisions. And if you don't have that around you, then you'll get swamped. So I hope that he appreciated that advice.What I also discussed was the fact that I had been encouraged by his statements on election night about the need for unity and his interest in being the President for all people, and that how he staffs, the first steps he takes, the first impressions he makes, the reset that can happen after an electionall those things are important and should be thought about. And I think it's important to give him the room and the space to do that. It takes time to put that together.But I emphasized to him that, look, in an election like this that was so hotly contested and so divided, gestures matter. And how he reaches out to groups that may not have supported him, how he signals his interest in their issues or concerns, I think those are the kinds of things that can set a tone that will help move things forward once he's actually taken office.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDiscussion with President-elect Trump about the matter\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, Mr. President. You said more than once that you did not believe that Donald Trump would ever be elected President, and that you thought he was unfit for the office. Now that you've spent time with him, sitting down and talking to him for an hour and a half in the Oval Office, do you now think that President-elect Trump is qualified to be President?And if I can do a compound question, the other one is, you mentioned staffing and tone. What do you say to those Americans who may not doubt that there will be a peaceful transition, but that are concerned about some of the policies and sentiments, either expressed by President-elect Trump himself or his supporters that may seem hostile to minorities and others? Specifically, I'm talking about the announcement that Steve Bannon, who is a proponent of the so-called alt-right movement, what many call the White nationalist movement, is going to have a prominent role in the White House under a President Trump as his chief strategist and senior adviser. What message does that send to the country, to the world?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nOkay. Athena, without copping out, I think it's fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on every appointment that the President-elect starts making if I want to be consistent with the notion that we're going to try to facilitate a smooth transition.Look, the people have spoken. Donald Trump will be the next President, the 45th President of the United States. And it will be up to him to set up a team that he thinks will serve him well and reflect his policies. And those who didn't vote for him have to recognize that that's how democracy works. That's how this system operates.When I won, there were a number of people who didn't like me and didn't like what I stood for. And I think that whenever you've got an incoming President of the other side, particularly in a bitter election like this, it takes a while for people to reconcile themselves with that new reality. Hopefully, it's a reminder that elections matter and voting counts. And so I don't know how many times we have to relearn this lesson, because we ended up having 43 percent of the country not voting who were eligible to vote. But it makes a difference.So given that President-elect Trump is now trying to balance what he said in the campaign and the commitments he made to his supporters with working with those who disagreed with him and Members of Congress and reaching out to constituencies that didn't vote for him, I think it's important for us to let him make his decisions. And I think the American people will judge over the course of the next couple of years whether they like what they see and whether these are the kinds of policies and this is the direction that they want to see the country go in.And my role is to make sure that when I hand off this White House that it is in the best possible shape and that I've been as helpful as I can to him in going forward and building on the progress that we've made.And my advice, as I said, to the President-elect when we had our discussions was that campaigning is different from governing. I think he recognizes that. I think he's sincere in wanting to be a successful President and moving this country forward. And I don't think any President ever comes in saying to himself, I want to figure out how to make people angry or alienate half the country. I think he's going to try as best he can to make sure that he delivers, not only for the people who voted for him, but for the people at large. And the good thing is, is that there are going to be elections coming up, so there's a built-in incentive for him to try to do that.But it's only been 6 days. And I think it will be important for him to have the room to staff up, to figure out what his priorities are, to be able to distinguish between what he was campaigning on and what is practical, what he can actually achieve. There are certain things that make for good sound bites, but don't always translate into good policy. And that's something that he and his team, I think, will wrestle with, in the same way that every President wrestles with.I did say to him, as I've said publicly, that because of the nature of the campaigns and the bitterness and ferocity of the campaigns, that it's really important to try to send some signals of unity and to reach out to minority groups or women or others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign. And I think that's something that he will want to do. But this is all happening real fast. He's got commitments to supporters that helped to get him here, and he's going to have to balance those. And over the coming weeks and months and years, my hope is, is that those impulses ultimately win out. But it's a little too early to start making judgments on that.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo you now think that President-elect Trump is qualified to be President?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

What choice do you think the American people made last week? And is there still a chance for what you called a course correction before Europeans make some of their choices?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI think the American people recognize that the world has shrunk, that it's interconnected, that you're not going to put that genie back in the bottle. The American people recognize that their careers or their kids' careers are going to have to be more dynamic, that they might not be working at a single plant for 30 years, but they might have to change careers. They might have to get more education. They might have to retool or retrain.And I think the American people are game for that. They want to make sure that the rules of the game are fair. And what that means is that if you look at surveys around Americans' attitudes on trade, the majority of the American people still support trade. But they're concerned about whether or not trade is fair and whether we've got the same access to other countries' markets as they have with us. Is there just a race to the bottom when it comes to wages and so forth?Now, I made an argumentthus far, unsuccessfullythat the trade deal we had organized, TPP, did exactly that: that it strengthened workers' rights and environmental rights, leveled the playing field, and as a consequence, would be good for American workers and American businesses. But that's a complex argument to make when people remember plants closing and jobs being offshored.So part of what I think this election reflected was people wanting that course correction that you described. And the message around stopping surges of immigration, not creating new trade deals that may be unfair, I think those were themes that played a prominent role in the campaign. As we now shift to governing, my argument is that we do need to make sure that we have an orderly, lawful immigration process, but that if it is orderly and lawful, immigration is good for our economy. It keeps this country young. It keeps it dynamic. We have entrepreneurs and strivers who come here and are willing to take risks. And that's part of the reason why America, historically, has been successful. It's part of the reason why our economy is stronger and better positioned than most of our other competitors, is because we've got a younger population that's more dynamic.When it comes to trade, I think when you're governing, it will become increasingly apparent that if you were to just eliminate trade deals with Mexico, for example, well, you've got a global supply chain. The parts that are allowing auto plants that were about to shut down to now employ double shifts is because they're bringing in some of those parts to assemble out of Mexico. And so it's not as simple as it might have seemed.And the key for uswhen I say us, I mean Americans, but I think particularly for progressivesis to say your concerns are real, your anxieties are real, here's how we fix them: higher minimum wage; stronger worker protections so workers have more leverage to get a bigger piece of the pie; stronger financial regulations, not weaker ones; yes to trade, but trade that ensures that these other countries that trade with us aren't engaging in child labor, for example; being attentive to inequality and not tone deaf to it, but offering prescriptions that are actually going to help folks in communities that feel forgotten.That's going to be our most important strategy. And I think we can successfully do that. People will still be looking to the United States. Our example will still carry great weight. And it continues to be my strong belief that the way we are going to make sure that everybody feels a part of this global economy is not by shutting ourselves off from each other even if we could, but rather by working together more effectively than we have in the past.Martha Raddatz [ABC News].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat choice do you think the American people made last week?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

And it continues to be my strong belief that the way we are going to make sure that everybody feels a part of this global economy is not by shutting ourselves off from each other even if we could, but rather by working together more effectively than we have in the past.Martha Raddatz [ABC News].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nIs there still a chance for what you called a course correction before Europeans make some of their choices?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thanks, Mr. President. Given some of the harsh words you had about Mr. Trump, calling him temperamentally unfit to be Commander in Chief, did anything surprise you about President-elect Trump when you met with him in your office? And also I want to know, does anything concern you about a Trump Presidency?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, we had a very cordial conversation. And that didn't surprise me to some degree, because I think that he is obviously a gregarious person. He's somebody who, I think, likes to mix it up and to have a vigorous debate.And what's clear is that he was able to tap into, yes, the anxieties, but also the enthusiasm of his voters in a way that was impressive. And I said so to him, because I think that to the extent that there were a lot of folks who missed the Trump phenomenon, I think that connection that he was able to make with his supporters that was impervious to events that might have sunk another candidate, that's powerful stuff.I also think that he is coming to this office with fewer set, hard-and-fast policy prescriptions than a lot of other Presidents might be arriving with. I don't think he is ideological. I think ultimately, he's pragmatic in that way. And that can serve him well, as long as he's got good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction.Do I have concerns? Absolutely. Of course, I've got concerns. He and I differ on a whole bunch of issues. But the Federal Government and our democracy is not a speedboat, it's an ocean liner, as I discovered when I came into office. It took a lot of really hard work for us to make significant policy changes, even in our first 2 years, when we had larger majorities than Mr. Trump will enjoy when he comes into office.And one of the things I advised him to do was to make sure that before he commits to certain courses of action, he's really dug in and thought through how various issues play themselves out. I'll use a obvious example where we have a difference, but it will be interesting to see what happens in the coming year, and that's the Affordable Care Act.So, obviously, this has been the holy grail for Republicans over the last 6, 7 yearswas, We've got to kill Obamacare. Now, that has been taken as an article of faith, that this is terrible, it doesn't work, and we have to undo it.But now that Republicans are in charge, they've got to take a look and say, let's see, we've got 20 million people who have health insurance who didn't have it before; health care costs generally have gone up at a significantly slower rate since Obamacare was passed than they did before, which has saved the Federal Treasury hundreds of billions of dollars; people who have health insurance are benefiting in all sorts of ways that they may not be aware of, everything from no longer having lifetime limits on the claims that they can make, to seniors getting prescription drug discounts under Medicare, to free mammograms.Now, it's one thing to characterize thesethis thing as not working when it's just an abstraction. Now, suddenly, you're in charge, and you're going to repeal it. Okay, well, what happens to those 20 million people who have health insurance? Are you going to just kick them off, and suddenly, they don't have health insurance? And in what ways are their lives better because of that? Are you going to repeal the provision that ensures that if you do have health insurance on your job and you lose your job or you change jobs or you start a small business, that you're not discriminated against because you've got a preexisting condition? That's really popular. How are you going to replace it? Are you going to change the policy that kids can stay on their parent's health insurance plan until they're 26? How are you going to approach all these issues?Now, my view is that if they can come up with something better that actually works, and a year or two after they've replaced the Affordable Care Act with their own plan, that 25 million people have health insurance, and it's cheaper and better and running smoothly, I'll be the first ones to say, that's great, congratulations.If, on the other hand, whatever they're proposing results in millions of people losing coverage and results in people who already have health insurance losing protections that were contained in the legislation, then we're going to have a problem. And I think that's not going to be unique to me; I think the American people will respond that way.So I think on a lot of issues, what you're going to see is, now comes the hard part. Now is governance. We are going to be able to present to the incoming administration a country that is stronger; a Federal Government that is working better and more efficiently; a national security apparatus that is both more effective and truer to our values; energy policies that are resulting in not just less pollution, but also more jobs.And I think the President-elect, rightly, would expect that he's judged on whether we improve from that baseline and on those metrics, or things get worse. And if things get worse, then the American people will figure that out pretty quick. And if things get better, then more power to him. And I'll be the first to congratulate him.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nConcerns about a Trump Presidency\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

But you, sir\u2014Mr. President, you had talked specifically about his temperament. Do you still have any concern about his temperament?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nAs I saidbecause, Athena asked the questionwhatever you bring to this office, this office has a habit of magnifying and pointing out, and hopefully, then you correct for it.This may seem like a silly example, but I know myself well enough to know I can't keep track of paper. I am not well organized in that way. And so pretty quickly, after I'm getting stacks of briefing books coming in every night, I say to myself, I've got to figure out a system, because I have bad filing, sorting, and organizing habits. And I've got to find some people who can help me keep track of this stuff. Now, that seems trivial, but actually, it ends up being a pretty big piece of business.I think what will happen with the President-elect is, there are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them. Because when you're a candidate and you say something that is inaccurate or controversial, it has less impact than it does when you're President of the United States. Everybody around the world is paying attention. Markets move. National security issues require a level of precision in order to make sure that you don't make mistakes. And I think he'she recognizes that this is different, and so do the American people.All right, I'm going to take just a couple more questions, and then I get out of here.Nadia Bilbassy [Nadia Bilbassy-Charters, Al Arabiya].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo you still have any concern about his temperament?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about two things that might be on your desk over the next couple months as you prepare for a Trump administration. One is at least three-quarters of a million undocumented immigrants provided the Federal Government information about themselves and their families as part of your deferred action program. I'm wondering if there's anything you can do to either reassure them or shield that information from the incoming Trump administration, considering his stance on immigration.And the second is, the administration and you have long maintained that the legal restraints upon you by Congress governing the movement of detainees from Gitmo are an unconstitutional infringement on your right as Commander in Chief. Considering that the gradual transfers that you've pursued are unlikely to continue under a Trump administration, is this now the time to, sort of, test that theory by moving the detainees and seeing where the chips end up lying?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThose are both excellent questions. On the deferred action program that we have, known as DACA, that relates to DREAMers who are currently benefiting from these provisions, I will urge the President-elect and the incoming administration to think long and hard before they are endangering the status of what for all practical purposes are American kids.I mean, these are kids who were brought here by their parents. They did nothing wrong. They've gone to school. They have pledged allegiance to the flag. Some of them have joined the military. They've enrolled in school. By definition, if they're part of this program, they are solid, wonderful young people of good character. And it is my strong belief that the majority of the American people would not want to see suddenly those kids have to start hiding again. And that's something that I will encourage the President-elect to look at.With respect to Guantanamo, it is true that I have not been able to close the darn thing[]because of the congressional restrictions that have been placed on us. What is also true is, we have greatly reduced the population. You now have significantly less than a hundred people there. There are some additional transfers that may be taking place over the next 2 months.There is a group of very dangerous people that we have strong evidence of having been guilty of committing terrorist acts against the United States. But because of the nature of the evidencein some cases, that evidence being compromisedit's very difficult to put them before a typical Article III court. And that group has always been the biggest challenge for us. My strong belief and preference is that we would be much better off closing Gitmo, moving them to a different facility that was clearly governed by U.S. jurisdiction. We'd do it a lot cheaper and just as safely.Congress disagrees with me, and I gather that the President-elect does as well. We will continue to explore options for doing that. But keep in mind that it's not just a matter of what I'm willing to do. One of the things you discover about being President is that there are all these rules and norms and laws and you've got to pay attention to them. And the people who work for you are also subject to those rules and norms. And that's a piece of advice that I gave to the incoming President.I am very proud of the fact that we willknock on woodleave this administration without significant scandal. We've made mistakes, there have been screw-ups, but I will put the ethics of this administration and our track record in terms of just abiding by the rules and norms and keeping trust with the American peopleI will put this administration against any administration in history.And the reason is because, frankly, we listened to the lawyers. And we had a strong White House Counsel's Office. We had a strong Ethics Office. We had people in every agency whose job it was to remind people, this is how you're supposed to do things. It doesn't mean everybody always did everything exactly the way it's supposed to, because we've got 2 million people working in the Federal Government, if you're including the military, and so we had to just try to institutionalize this as much as we could. And that takes a lot of work. And one of my suggestions to the incoming President is, is that he take that part of the job seriously as well. Again, you wouldn't know this if you were listening to some news outlets or some members of oversight committees in Congress. [] But if you actually look at the facts, it works.And this is just one example of the numerous ways in which the Federal Government is much better today than it was, without people really knowing. You look at VA. People remember the legitimate problems that were publicized in Phoenix. It was scandalous what happened. What people don't remember is, is that we've brought in well over a million people who are getting benefits that weren't getting it before, driven the backlog for disability benefits way down, cut homelessness in half. Just made the agency work betternot work perfect, but work better.And one of the mottos I always had with my staff was, better is good. Perfect is unattainable. Better is possible.And so we will try to share the lessons that we've learned over these last 8 years with the incoming President. And my hope is, he makes things better. And if he does, we'll all benefit from it.All right? Thank you, everybody. You guys, some of you who are traveling, you'll get a chance to ask more questions.

And while we're talking about legacy items, if I could just ask another quick one on Guantanamo Bay. You have 4 months left, 60 prisoners left. At this point, are you willing to acknowledge that the prison will be open by the time you leave office?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, in terms of my reception here, as far as I can tell, it's been terrific. I don't know if you've gone and talked to some people in Laos. They seem pretty happy about my visit. Everywhere we've gone, we've had a great reception, just as earlier when we went to Vietnam we got a great reception. You'll recall, there were millions of people lining the streets.So if this theory about my reception and my rebalance policy is based on me going down the short stairs in China, yes, I think that is overblown. [] And I think that any reasonable person, certainly any person in the region, would be puzzled as to how this became somehow indicative of the work that we've done here.If you look at the remarks of leaders, if you look at the remarks of ordinary people, if you look at the concrete work that we've gotten done on everything from economic programs to development programs, to legacy of war issues, to promoting civil society and young people, the concern that I've heard is not that what we've done hasn't been important and successful. The concern that I've heard is, will it continue? And almost uniformly, the question I get from other leaders is, we hope that America's interest and presence and engagement is sustained.And my hope and expectation is, is that my successor will, in fact, sustain this kind of engagement, because there is a lot happening here. You've got countries here that are taking off. You've got one of the most dynamic and youngest populations in the world. This is where the action is going to be when it comes to commerce and trade and ultimately creating U.S. jobs by being able to sell to this market.And that's the only feedback that I've received. And that's not just based on what leaders tell me. If you read local newspapers or you talk to people, that's been the same commentary that we receive generally.With respect to Guantanamo, I am not ready to concede that it may still remain open, because we're still working diligently to continue to shrink the population. I continue to believe that Guantanamo is a recruitment tool for terrorist organizations, that it's\u2014clouds and sours some of the counterterrorism cooperation that we need to engage in. And it's not necessary, and it's hugely expensive for U.S. taxpayers.Is there strong resistance in Congress? Absolutely. But as we continue to shrink the population to the point where we're looking at 40 or 50 people and are maintaining a multimillion-dollar operation to house these handfuls of individuals, I think the American people should be asking the question, why are we spending this kind of money that could be spent on other things when it's not necessary for our safety and security?So there's no doubt that because of the politics in Congress right now, it is a tough road to hoe. But I expect to work really hard over the next 4 months\u20145 months\u20144\u00bd months.

Well, I just came out of a long day of meetings\u2014[]\u2014so I just heard about some of this. But I have seen some of those colorful statements in the past, and so clearly, he's a colorful guy.

Obviously, the Filipino people are some of our closest friends and allies, and the Philippines is a treaty ally of ours. But I always want to make sure that if I'm having a meeting, that it's actually productive and we're getting something done.We recognize the significant burden that the drug trade plays just not just in the Philippines, but around the world. And fighting narcotrafficking is tough. But we will always assert the need to have due process and to engage in that fight against drugs in a way that's consistent with basic international norms. And so, undoubtedly, if and when we have a meeting, that this is something that's going to be brought up, and my expectation, my hope is, is that it could be dealt with constructively.But I'll have my team discuss this.

Thank you, Mr. President. Heading into Laos, what are the main things you can offer its leaders? And what do you plan to push for in return? On the offering side, for example, I'm wondering how you view U.S. responsibility for unexploded ordnance. On the asking side, what are you pushing for most? Is it human rights? Closer U.S. ties in the face of China? Improving their problems with governance and corruption? What's the priority?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell look, symbolically, this is important. I'll be the first U.S. President to visit Laos. And when you think about the history of the United States and Laos, I think it's useful to see what's happened in the evolution of our relationship with Vietnam, a country that I just visited recently.At the outset, as we're trying to build trust, a lot of work can be done around war legacy issues. For the Lao, that involves dealing with unexploded ordnance, which is still plaguing big chunks of the countryside. And since Laos is still a relatively poor country that is developing, their capacity alone to clean that up is hampered by a lack of resources. We should help. And my expectation is, is that in our meetings over the course of several days, that we'll be able to provide some really concrete assistance that ensures that innocent kids who are running through a field or a farmer that's trying to clear a field or a business that's trying to get set up, that they're not endangered by the possibility of an explosion.Likewise, we have deep commitments to accounting for those who were lost during that war. And as was true with Vietnam\u2014to the extent that we're able to find out more about our missing in action and our POWs\u2014that not only provides enormous comfort and meaning for families and is consistent with our traditions, but it also ends up being a show of good faith on the part of the country and a way for us to move into a next phase of a relationship.And so a lot of the conversation, I think, will start there, but it doesn't end there. We've had an initiative, for example, helping all the countries along the Mekong Delta to find ways to harness development and deal with environmental issues. And that's something that we've been doing through ASEAN over the course of several years now. For us to be able to expand some of that work, I think, would be important. Establishing people-to-people exchanges is another area that historically has been important.I do think Laos, seeing the enormous economic progress that Vietnam and China and others have made, are going to be very interested in finding ways in which they can advance into the global economy and help themselves grow, and I think that we can be a useful partner there.So I think there will be a broad-based agenda. But if you think about the visit I made to Ho Chi Minh City and driving through those streets and the enormous wellspring of good will that you saw, that started with some of the same kinds of steps that we're going to be taking with Laos. But I think we can, hopefully, do it faster, make more progress faster than we did over the course of 10, 15 years, because we've learned some things. And I think Laos is very eager to engage with us, and we're eager to engage with them.So I look forward to visiting what I hear is a beautiful country.

I'll be the first U.S. President to visit Laos. And when you think about the history of the United States and Laos, I think it's useful to see what's happened in the evolution of our relationship with Vietnam, a country that I just visited recently.At the outset, as we're trying to build trust, a lot of work can be done around war legacy issues. For the Lao, that involves dealing with unexploded ordnance, which is still plaguing big chunks of the countryside. And since Laos is still a relatively poor country that is developing, their capacity alone to clean that up is hampered by a lack of resources. We should help. And my expectation is, is that in our meetings over the course of several days, that we'll be able to provide some really concrete assistance that ensures that innocent kids who are running through a field or a farmer that's trying to clear a field or a business that's trying to get set up, that they're not endangered by the possibility of an explosion.Likewise, we have deep commitments to accounting for those who were lost during that war. And as was true with Vietnam\u2014to the extent that we're able to find out more about our missing in action and our POWs\u2014that not only provides enormous comfort and meaning for families and is consistent with our traditions, but it also ends up being a show of good faith on the part of the country and a way for us to move into a next phase of a relationship.And so a lot of the conversation, I think, will start there, but it doesn't end there. We've had an initiative, for example, helping all the countries along the Mekong Delta to find ways to harness development and deal with environmental issues. And that's something that we've been doing through ASEAN over the course of several years now. For us to be able to expand some of that work, I think, would be important.

And if I may, on one other business topic, how would you assess the likelihood of the actions taken on steel today of making a difference in overcapacity?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nGood. No, those are both great questions. This issue of tax avoidance and tax evasion is something that we have actively promoted as an issue for the G-20 to tackle. We've worked with not only the G-20 countries, but also some of the multilateral organizations, like the OECD, to refine how we can approach these problems. It's a complicated piece of business.We did not bring up the specific case of Apple, because as a general rule, I don't want to bring up a single case in a forum like this, where we're trying to shape broader policy. But at home, we have been focused\u2014whether it's on the inversion rules that we put forward, the proposals that we put forward to define who the beneficiaries are behind the veil so that we can catch people who are avoiding their taxes\u2014we're doing a bunch of stuff at home, and we want to coordinate better norms internationally. The one thing that we have to make sure we do is to move in concert with other countries, because there's always a danger that if one of us acts unilaterally, that it's not just a matter of a U.S. company being impacted, but it may also have an effect in terms of our ability to collect taxes from that same company. And so you might end up with a situation where they pay into Europe, and U.S.\u2014the U.S. Treasury is shortchanged. So if there is not some coordination between various tax authorities, you get a problem there.In the same way that we think there has to be some coordination about even some of our closest allies racing to the bottom in terms of how they enforce their tax policies in ways that lead to revenue shifting and tax avoidance in our country.So this is not something that I think is going to be sorted out overnight. I do think that if we are to regain the trust of ordinary people that the system is not rigged and deal with these trends of inequality that have risen out of globalization and technological change, that we've got to make sure we tackle this issue in an effective way.And we've made some progress, but not as much as we need to. And my hope is, is that it's recognized that it's in the interest of all countries, whether they're developed countries or developing countries, to work together to put a stop to this. Because developed countries are losing revenue, and that erodes their tax base and their ability to educate kids and build universities and build infrastructure, but it also wallops developing countries because oftentimes, tax avoidance can go hand in hand with corrupt practices that impede development.In terms of excess capacity, this is an issue that we wanted to get on the agenda. We got it on the agenda. In my bilateral conversations with President Xi, there was an agreement that we would make progress on dealing with steel overcapacity, which, by the way, is consistent with the plans that President Xi himself has had to reorient the economy so that it's not so heavily dependent on state-owned enterprises and an export model.So we've made some progress\u2014not as much as we'd like to see\u2014but some progress on that front bilaterally. Multilaterally, the way this was resolved was, the G-20 agreed to put together an intensive process of gathering all the data, determining what the best steps are, which will then be reported in the G-20 in Hamburg next year. And I think there was a validation of the basic principle that, to the extent that overcapacity is the result not just of market forces, but specific policy decisions that are distorting a well-functioning market, that that needs to be fixed.And so it was one of a number of examples that aren't always sexy and don't attract a lot of headlines of where issues that we've raised in the G-20 get adopted, and then a bunch of work gets done, and the following year, you start seeing action, and slowly, we strengthen and build up international norms.If you look at the issue of IT and the digital economy, we were able to get the G-20 to adopt a range of principles about an open Internet, net neutrality, making sure that businesses and vendors and providers aren't discriminated across borders, reflecting a lot of the foundational principles that have led to this digital revolution over the last several years.And that will, in turn, generate a bunch of new work. And there will still be conflicts about how people deal with censorship or how they deal with cybersecurity issues, but we chip away at it, and over time, what you get is sturdier international norms that everybody abides to and will help all countries grow and help people prosper. So I'm\u2014my parting words at the G-20 were, having watched this process over the last 8 years, I think we all have to recognize, these are turbulent times. A lot of countries are seeing volatile politics. Sometimes, you read the headlines, and you can get discouraged about whether the international community and leadership are able to shape solutions fast enough for the scale of the problems, whether it's migrants and refugees or climate change or terrorism or making sure the international economy is working for everybody. But then, when you look back over the course of 8 years, actually, you find out, things have gotten better, not always as fast as we'd like, but in significant ways.You look at the progress we've made on the financial system. The American banking system now has $700 billion more in capital; it is much safer and much sturdier. But it's not just us. Because of the G-20, you also have a Basel III agreement in which all countries are having to strengthen their capital requirements and put in place some basic safeguards to prevent what happened at Lehmans. And that's true across the board.So, as always, I'd always like to see even more get done, but I'm cautiously optimistic about the progress that we made. I tell my staff when they feel worn out sometimes that better is always good. It may not be everything that needs to get done, but if it's better than before we started, we'll take it. All right?Thank you very much, everybody.[.]Thank you, guys.

Are you satisfied that the United States and its allies have shifted strategy sufficiently to address that change?And secondly, given your comments this week about Donald Trump's volatility and lack of fitness to be President, are you concerned that he will be receiving security briefings about ISIS and other sensitive national security issues?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nOkay. I'm never satisfied with our response, because if you're satisfied that means the problem is solved, and it's not. So we just spent a couple hours meeting with my top national security folks to look at what more can be done.It is absolutely necessary for us to defeat ISIL in Iraq and Syria. It is not sufficient, but it is necessary. Because so long as they have those bases, they can use their propaganda to suggest that somehow there's still some caliphate being born, and that can insinuate itself then in the minds of folks who may be willing to travel there or carry out terrorist attacks. It's also destabilizing for countries in the region at a time when the region is already unstable.So I am pleased with the progress that we've made on the ground in Iraq and Syria. We're far from freeing Mosul and Raqqa. But what we've shown is, is that when it comes to conventional fights, ISIL can be beaten with partners on the ground so long as they've got the support from coalition forces that we've been providing.In the meantime, though, you're seeing ISIL carry out external terrorist acts, and they've learned something they've adapted from Al aida, which had a much more centralized operation and tried to plan very elaborate attacks. And what ISIL has figured out is that if they can convince a handful of people, or even one person, to carry out an attack on a subway or at a parade or some other public venue and kill scores of people, as opposed to thousands of people, it still creates the kinds of fear and concern that elevates their profile.So, in some ways, rooting out these networks for smaller, less complicated attacks is tougher, because it doesn't require as many resources on their part or preparation. But it does mean that we've got to do even more to generate the intelligence and to work with our partners in order to degrade those networks.And the fact is, is that those networks will probably sustain themselves even after ISIL is defeated in Raqqa and Mosul. But what we've learned from our efforts to defeat Al aida is that if we stay on it, our intelligence gets better, and we adapt as well. And eventually, we will dismantle these networks also.This is part of the reason why, however, it is so important for us to keep our eye on the ball and not panic, not succumb to fear. Because ISIL can't defeat the United States of America or our NATO partners. We can defeat ourselves, though, if we make bad decisions. And we have to understand that as painful and as tragic as these attacks are, that we are going to keep on grinding away, preventing them wherever we can, using a whole-of-Government effort to knock down their propaganda, to disrupt their networks, to take their key operatives off the battlefield, and that eventually, we will win.But if we start making bad decisions\u2014indiscriminately killing civilians, for example, in some of these areas, instituting offensive religious tests on who can enter the country\u2014those kinds of strategies can end up backfiring. Because in order for us to ultimately win this fight, we cannot frame this as a clash of civilizations between the West and Islam. That plays exactly into the hands of ISIL and the perversions\u2014the perverse interpretations of Islam that they're putting forward.As far as Mr. Trump, we are going to go by the law, which is that\u2014and in both tradition and the law\u2014that if somebody is the nominee, the Republican nominee for President, they need to get a security briefing so that if they were to win, they are not starting from scratch in terms of being prepared for this office.And I'm not going to go into details of the nature of the security briefings that both candidates receive. What I will say is that they have been told these are classified briefings. And if they want to be President, they've got to start acting like President, and that means being able to receive these briefings and not spread them around.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAre you satisfied that the United States and its allies have shifted strategy sufficiently to address that change?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, Mr. President. What is your response to critics who say the $400 million in cash that you sent to Iran was a ransom payment? Was it really simply a pure coincidence that a sum that was\u2014a payment that was held up for almost four decades was suddenly sent at the exact same time that the American prisoners were released? And can you assure the American people that none of that money went to support terrorism?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nOkay. The\u2014it's been interesting to watch this story surface. Some of you may recall, we announced these payments in January, many months ago. There wasn't a secret. Right? We announced them to all of you. Josh did a briefing on them. This wasn't some nefarious deal. And at the time, we explained that Iran had pressed a claim before an international tribunal about them recovering money of theirs that we had frozen; that, as a consequence of its working its way through the international tribunal, it was the assessment of our lawyers that we were now at a point where there was significant litigation risk and we could end up costing ourselves billions of dollars. It was their advice and suggestion that we settle. And that's what these payments represent. And it wasn't a secret. We were completely open with everybody about it. And it's interesting to me how suddenly this became a story again. That's point number one.Point number two: We do not pay ransom for hostages. We've got a number of Americans being held all around the world. And I meet with their families, and it is heartbreaking. And we have stood up an entire section of interagency experts who devote all their time to working with these families to get these Americans out.But those families know that we have a policy that we don't pay ransom. And the notion that we would somehow start now in this high-profile way and announce it to the world\u2014even as we're looking into the faces of other hostage families\u2014families whose loved ones are being held hostage and say to them that we don't pay ransom\u2014defies logic. So that's point number two. We do not pay ransom. We didn't here. And we don't\u2014we won't in the future, precisely because if we did, then we would start encouraging Americans to be targeted, much in the same way that some countries that do pay ransom end up having a lot more of their citizens being taken by various groups.Point number three is that the timing of this was, in fact, dictated by the fact that as a consequence of us negotiating around the nuclear deal, we actually had diplomatic negotiations and conversations with Iran for the first time in several decades. So the issue is not so much that it was a coincidence as it is that we were able to have a direct discussion.John Kerry could meet with the Foreign Minister, which meant that our ability to clear accounts on a number of different issues at the same time converged. And it was important for us to take advantage of that opportunity both to deal with this litigation risk that had been raised\u2014it was important for us to make sure that we finished the job on the Iran nuclear deal\u2014and since we were in a conversation with them, it was important for us to be able to push them hard in getting these Americans out.And let me make a final point on this. It's now been well over a year since the agreement with Iran to stop its nuclear program was signed. And by all accounts, it has worked exactly the way we said it was going to work. You will recall that there were all these horror stories about how Iran was going to cheat and this wasn't going to work and Iran was going to get $150 billion to finance terrorism and all these kinds of scenarios, and none of them have come to pass. And it's not just the assessment of our intelligence community, it's the assessment of the Israeli military and intelligence community\u2014the country that was most opposed to this deal\u2014that acknowledges this has been a game changer and that Iran has abided by the deal and that they no longer have the sort of short-term breakout capacity that would allow them to develop nuclear weapons.So what I'm interested in is, if there's some news to be made, why not have some of these folks who were predicting disaster say, you know what, this thing actually worked? [] Now, that would be a shock. [] That would be impressive, if some of these folks who had said the sky is falling suddenly said, you know what, we were wrong, and we are glad that Iran no longer has the capacity to break out in short term and develop a nuclear weapon. But of course, that wasn't going to happen.Instead, what we have is the manufacturing of outrage in a story that we disclosed in January. And the only bit of news that is relevant on this is the fact that we paid cash, which brings me to my last point. The reason that we had to give them cash is precisely because we are so strict in maintaining sanctions and we do not have a banking relationship with Iran that we couldn't send them a check and we could not wire the money.And it is not at all clear to me why it is that cash, as opposed to a check or a wire transfer, has made this into a news story. Maybe because it kind of feels like some spy novel or some crime novel because cash was exchanged. The reason cash was exchanged is because we don't have a banking relationship with Iran, which is precisely part of the pressure that we were able to apply to them so that they would ship a whole bunch of nuclear material out and close down a bunch of facilities that, as I remember, 2 years ago, 3 years ago, 5 years ago, was people's top fear and priority, that we make sure Iran doesn't have breakout nuclear capacity. They don't.

So the issue is not so much that it was a coincidence as it is that we were able to have a direct discussion.John Kerry could meet with the Foreign Minister, which meant that our ability to clear accounts on a number of different issues at the same time converged. And it was important for us to take advantage of that opportunity both to deal with this litigation risk that had been raised\u2014it was important for us to make sure that we finished the job on the Iran nuclear deal\u2014and since we were in a conversation with them, it was important for us to be able to push them hard in getting these Americans out.And let me make a final point on this. It's now been well over a year since the agreement with Iran to stop its nuclear program was signed. And by all accounts, it has worked exactly the way we said it was going to work. You will recall that there were all these horror stories about how Iran was going to cheat and this wasn't going to work and Iran was going to get $150 billion to finance terrorism and all these kinds of scenarios, and none of them have come to pass. And it's not just the assessment of our intelligence community, it's the assessment of the Israeli military and intelligence community\u2014the country that was most opposed to this deal\u2014that acknowledges this has been a game changer and that Iran has abided by the deal and that they no longer have the sort of short-term breakout capacity that would allow them to develop nuclear weapons.So what I'm interested in is, if there's some news to be made, why not have some of these folks who were predicting disaster say, you know what, this thing actually worked? [] Now, that would be a shock. [] That would be impressive, if some of these folks who had said the sky is falling suddenly said, you know what, we were wrong, and we are glad that Iran no longer has the capacity to break out in short term and develop a nuclear weapon. But of course, that wasn't going to happen.Instead, what we have is the manufacturing of outrage in a story that we disclosed in January. And the only bit of news that is relevant on this is the fact that we paid cash, which brings me to my last point. The reason that we had to give them cash is precisely because we are so strict in maintaining sanctions and we do not have a banking relationship with Iran that we couldn't send them a check and we could not wire the money.And it is not at all clear to me why it is that cash, as opposed to a check or a wire transfer, has made this into a news story. Maybe because it kind of feels like some spy novel or some crime novel because cash was exchanged. The reason cash was exchanged is because we don't have a banking relationship with Iran, which is precisely part of the pressure that we were able to apply to them so that they would ship a whole bunch of nuclear material out and close down a bunch of facilities that, as I remember, 2 years ago, 3 years ago, 5 years ago, was people's top fear and priority, that we make sure Iran doesn't have breakout nuclear capacity. They don't. This worked.Josh Lederman [Associated Press].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nCan the President assure the American people that none of the money went to support terrorism?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, Mr. President. Repeatedly now, Donald Trump has said that this election will be rigged against him, challenging really the core foundation of our democratic system. Can you promise the American people that this election will be conducted in a fair way? And are you worried that comments like his could erode the public's faith in the outcome of the election? And if he does win, given that you have just declared him unfit, what will you say to the American people?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, at the end of the day, it's the American people's decision. I have one vote. I have the same vote you do. I have the vote that all the voters who are eligible all across the country have. I've offered my opinion, but ultimately, it's the American people's decision to make collectively. And if somebody wins the election and they are President, then my constitutional responsibility is to peacefully transfer power to that individual and do everything I can to help them succeed.It is\u2014I don't even really know where to start on answering this question. [] Of course, the elections will not be rigged. What does that mean? [] The Federal Government doesn't run the election process. States and cities and communities all across the country, they are the ones who set up the voting systems and the voting booths. And if Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country, including in places like Texas, where typically it's not Democrats who are in charge of voting booths, that's ridiculous. That doesn't make any sense. And I don't think anybody would take that seriously.Now, we do take seriously\u2014as we always do\u2014our responsibilities to monitor and preserve the integrity of the voting process. If we see signs that a voting machine or system is vulnerable to hacking, then we inform those local authorities who are running the elections that they need to be careful. If we see jurisdictions that are violating Federal laws in terms of equal access and aren't providing ramps for disabled voters or are discriminating in some fashion or are otherwise violating civil rights laws, then the Justice Department will come in and take care of that.But this will be an election like every other election. And I think all of us at some points in our lives have played sports or maybe just played in a schoolyard or a sandbox. And sometimes, folks, if they lose, they start complaining that they got cheated. But I've never heard of somebody complaining about being cheated before the game was over or before the score is even tallied. So my suggestion would be go out there and try to win the election.If Mr. Trump is up 10 or 15 points on election day and ends up losing, then maybe he can raise some questions.

First, back to ISIS and Iraq and Syria, your very own national counterterrorism operation has found that despite all of the decisive defeats that the U.S. and coalition have dealt ISIS on the battlefield, that they've expanded their threat worldwide to include as many as 18 operational bases. In the 6 years you've been dealing, do you feel any personal disappointment that there hasn't been more progress? And in any discussions you've had with the U.S. military and your intelligence agencies, have you come up with any new ideas on how to deal or defeat ISIS?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nEvery time there is a terrorist attack, I feel disappointment, because I'd like to prevent all of them. And that's true not just when the attacks are in Europe or in the United States. When you read stories about attacks in Lebanon or Iraq or Afghanistan or distant parts of the world that don't get as much attention, they get my attention, because that's somebody's kid and that's somebody's mom and that's somebody who was just going about his business, and mindlessly, senselessly, this person was murdered.So I haven't gotten numb to it. It bugs me whenever it happens and wherever it happens. And we are constantly pushing ourselves to see, are there additional ideas that we can deploy to defeat this threat?Now, it is important that we recognize, terrorism as a tactic has been around for a long time. And if you look at the seventies or the eighties or the nineties, there was some terrorist activity somewhere in the world that was brutal. And as much as I would like to say that during my 8-year Presidency, we could have eliminated terrorism completely, it's not surprising that that hasn't happened, and I don't expect that will happen under the watch of my successors.I do think that because of our extraordinary efforts, the homeland is significantly safer than it otherwise would be. Now, some\u2014in some ways, this is arguing the counterfactuals, but the attacks we prevent I take great satisfaction in, and I am grateful for the extraordinary work that our teams do. I don't think there's any doubt that had we not destroyed Al aida in the FATA that more Americans would have been killed, and we might have seen more attacks like we saw on 9/11. And we have maintained vigilance, recognizing that those threats still remain, those aspirations in the minds of these folks still remain, but it is much harder for them to carry out large-scale attacks like that than it used to be.What we have seen is that these lower level attacks carried out by fewer operatives or an individual with less sophisticated and less expensive weapons can do real damage. And that, I think, points to the need for us to not just have a military strategy, not just have a traditional counterterrorism strategy that's designed to bust up networks and catch folks before they carry out their attacks\u2014although those still are necessary, and we have to be more and more sophisticated about how we carry those out; it still requires us to have much greater cooperation with our partners around the world\u2014but it points to the fact that we're going to have to do a better job in draining the ideology that is behind these attacks; that right now is emanating largely out of the Middle East and a very small fraction of the Muslim world a perversion of Islam that has taken root and has been turbocharged over the Internet; and that is appealing to even folks who don't necessarily know anything about Islam and aren't even practicing Islam in any serious way, but have all kinds of psychosis and latch on to this as some way of being important and magnifying themselves.And that's tougher because that involves both changes in geopolitics in places like Syria. It requires cultural changes in regions like the Middle East and North Africa that are going through generational changes and shifts as the old order collapses. It requires psychology and thinking about how do these messages of hate reach individuals and are there ways in which we can intervene ahead of time. And all that work is being done. And we've got the very best people at it, and each day, they're making a difference in saving lives, not just here, but around the world.But it's a challenge precisely because if you're successful 99 percent of the time, that 1 percent can still mean heartbreak for families. And it's difficult because in a country, let's say, of 300 million people here in the United States, if 99.9 percent of people are immune from this hateful ideology, but one-tenth of 1 percent are susceptible to it, that's a lot of dangerous people running around. And we can't always anticipate them ahead of time because they may not have criminal records. So this is going to be a challenge.I just want to end on the point that I made earlier. How we react to this is as important as the efforts we take to destroy ISIL, prevent these networks from penetrating. You can't separate those two things out. The reason it's called terrorism, as opposed to just a standard war, is that these are weak enemies that can't match us in conventional power, but what they can do is make us scared. And when it make\u2014and when societies get scared, they can react in ways that undermine the fabric of our society. It makes us weaker and makes us more vulnerable and creates politics that divide us in ways that hurt us over the long term.And so if we remain steady and steadfast and vigilant, but also take the long view and maintain perspective and remind ourselves of who we are and what we care about most deeply, and what we cherish and what's good about this country and what's good about the international order and civilization that was built in part because of the sacrifices of our men and women after a 20th century full of world war\u2014if we remember that\u2014then we're going to be okay. But we're still going to see, episodically, these kinds of tragedies, and we're going to have to keep working on it until we make things better.

First, back to ISIS and Iraq and Syria, your very own national counterterrorism operation has found that despite all of the decisive defeats that the U.S. and coalition have dealt ISIS on the battlefield, that they've expanded their threat worldwide to include as many as 18 operational bases. In the 6 years you've been dealing, do you feel any personal disappointment that there hasn't been more progress? And in any discussions you've had with the U.S. military and your intelligence agencies, have you come up with any new ideas on how to deal or defeat ISIS?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nEvery time there is a terrorist attack, I feel disappointment, because I'd like to prevent all of them. And that's true not just when the attacks are in Europe or in the United States. When you read stories about attacks in Lebanon or Iraq or Afghanistan or distant parts of the world that don't get as much attention, they get my attention, because that's somebody's kid and that's somebody's mom and that's somebody who was just going about his business, and mindlessly, senselessly, this person was murdered.So I haven't gotten numb to it. It bugs me whenever it happens and wherever it happens.

Now, you\u2014I'm sure you're not surprised that some in the military are not supportive of that deal. Some European allies think it would be a deal with the devil. What makes you so confident that you can trust the Russians and Vladimir Putin?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI'm not confident that we can trust the Russians and Vladimir Putin, which is why we have to test whether or not we can get an actual cessation of hostilities that includes an end to the kinds of aerial bombing and civilian death and destruction that we've seen carried out by the Asad regime. And Russia may not be able to get there either because they don't want to or because they don't have sufficient influence over Asad. And that's what we're going to test.So we go into this without any blinders on. We're very clear that Russia has been willing to support a murderous regime that has\u2014and an individual, in Asad, who has destroyed his country just to cling on to power. What started with peaceful protests has led to a shattering of an entire and pretty advanced society. And so whenever you're trying to broker any kind of deal with an individual like that or a country like that, you've got to go in there with some skepticism.On the other hand, if we are able to get a genuine cessation of hostilities that prevents indiscriminate bombing, that protects civilians, that allows humanitarian access and creates some sort of pathway to begin the hard work of political negotiations inside of Syria, then we have to try, because the alternative is a perpetuation of civil war.I've been wrestling with this now for a lot of years. I am pretty confident that a big chunk of my gray hair comes out of my Syria meetings. [] And there is not a meeting that I don't end by saying, is there something else we could be doing that we haven't thought of. Is there a plan F, G, H that we think would lead to a resolution of this issue so that the Syrian people can put their lives back together again and we can bring peace and relieve the refugee crisis that's taken place? And the options are limited when you have a civil war like this, when you have a ruler who doesn't care about his people, when you've got terrorist organizations that are brutal and would impose their own kind of dictatorship on people, and you have a moderate opposition and ordinary civilians who are often outgunned and outmanned. And that's a very difficult situation to deal with. But we've got to give it a chance.There are going to be some bottom lines that we expect for us to cooperate with Russia beyond the sort of deconfliction that we're currently doing. And that means restraint on the part of the regime that so far has not been forthcoming.Early on in this version of the cessation of hostilities, we probably saw some lives saved and some lessening of violence. The violations of this cessation have grown to the point where it just barely exists, particularly up in the northwestern part of the country. So we're going to test and see if we can get something that sticks. And if not, then Russia will have shown itself very clearly to be an irresponsible actor on the world stage that is supporting a murderous regime and will have to be\u2014will have to answer to that on the international stage.All right? Thank you very much, everybody.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat makes you so confident that you can trust the Russians and Vladimir Putin?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, Mr. President. Given the Republican nominee's recent comments about the Khan family and his statement that, if President, he would consider recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea, does it make you question his fitness to be President?And secondly, sir, on Libya. You've said in the past that the worst mistake of your Presidency may have been your failure to plan for the aftermath of that 2011 NATO intervention in Libya. Do you see your new decision to bomb ISIS there as a direct result of that?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes, I think the Republican nominee is unfit to serve as President. I said so last week, and he keeps on proving it. The notion that he would attack a Gold Star family that had made such extraordinary sacrifices on behalf of our country, the fact that he doesn't appear to have basic knowledge around critical issues in Europe, in the Middle East, in Asia, means that he's woefully unprepared to do this job.And this is not just my opinion. I think what's been interesting is the repeated denunciations of his statements by leading Republicans, including the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader and prominent Republicans like John McCain. And the question, I think, that they have to ask themselves is, if you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him? What does this say about your party that this is your standard bearer? This isn't a situation where you have an episodic gaffe. This is daily and weekly, where they are distancing themselves from statements he's making. There has to be a point in which you say, this is not somebody I can support for President of the United States, even if he purports to be a member of my party.And the fact that that has not yet happened makes some of these denunciations ring hollow. I don't doubt their sincerity. I don't doubt that they were outraged about some of the statements that Mr. Trump and his supporters made about the Khan family. But there has to come a point at which you say, somebody who makes those kinds of statements doesn't have the judgment, the temperament, the understanding to occupy the most powerful position in the world.Because a lot of people depend on the White House getting stuff right, and this is different than just having policy disagreements. Now, I recognize that they all profoundly disagree with myself or Hillary Clinton on tax policy or on certain elements of foreign policy. But there have been Republican Presidents with whom I disagreed with, but I didn't have a doubt that they could function as President. I think I was right and Mitt Romney and John McCain were wrong on certain policy issues, but I never thought that they couldn't do the job. And had they won, I would have been disappointed, but I would have said to all Americans, they are\u2014this is our President, and I know they're going to abide by certain norms and rules and common sense, will observe basic decency, will have enough knowledge about economic policy and foreign policy and our constitutional traditions and rule of law that our Government will work, and then we'll compete 4 years from now to try to win an election.But that's not the situation here. And that's not just my opinion; that is the opinion of many prominent Republicans. There has to come a point at which you say, enough. And the alternative is that the entire party, the Republican Party, effectively endorses and validates the positions that are being articulated by Mr. Trump. And as I said in my speech last week, I don't think that actually represents the views of a whole lot of Republicans out there.With respect to Libya, I have said on several occasions that we did the right thing in preventing what could have been a massacre, a blood bath in Libya. And we did so as part of an international coalition and under U.N. mandate. But I think that all of us, collectively, were not sufficiently attentive to what had to happen the day after and the day after and the day after that, in order to ensure that there were strong structures in place to assure basic security and peace inside of Libya.The good news is, is that we now have the beginnings of a government in the Government of National Accord. They are serious about trying to bring all the factions together to start creating a basic security structure to begin to monitor Libya's borders and to cooperate internationally to deal with issues like ISIL penetration on their territory. And at the request of that Government, after they had already made significant progress against ISIL and had essentially pushed ISIL into a very confined area in and around Sirte, it is in America's national security interests in our fight against ISIL to make sure that they're able to finish the job. And so we're working in partnership with them to assure that ISIL does not get a stronghold in Libya, even as Libya begins what is going to be a long process to establish a functioning government and security system there.So the good news is that they recognize these\u2014this terrorist organization in their midst is contrary to their national interests, as well as the world's. And we're hopeful that having completed this process of driving ISIL out, they will then be in a position to start bringing the parties together inside that country. And not only us, but the Europeans and other countries around the world have a great interest in seeing stability in Libya, because that\u2014the absence of stability has helped to fuel some of the challenges that we've seen in terms of the migration crisis in Europe and some of the humanitarian tragedies that we've seen in the open seas between Libya and Europe.

Thank you, PM Lee and President Obama. First question is for Prime Minister Lee. You've spoken about the continuation of the U.S. rebalance being a significant part of peace and stability in Asia. How do you envision this continuation proceeding in the next 50 years? And what role do you see Singapore playing in this context? What are some of the hot-button issues that we're likely to face as the U.S., hopefully, continues its rebalance?Second question. You've mentioned the strong bipartisan links that Singapore has had with nine different U.S. Presidents from both sides of the political divide, a very strong record there. How would we address a U.S. leader which adopts a stance that it's more closed off, more antiglobalization, for example, if we see that in November?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nS., especially coming on the heels of the latest announcement of the medical team to the global coalition against ISIS. With the rising threat of terror in Asia and indeed the rest of the world, the potential for military confrontation in the South China Sea, how do you see Singapore featuring in U.S. plans to address this going forward?And last question, Four more years is a phrase that I think you've been hearing a little bit in the past few weeks and months. And while that's not possible\u2014[]\u2014if it were, how would you continue developing relationships with Singapore? What would be your key focus going forward, maybe the next 50 years as well? Thank you. Well, 50 years is a very long time. [] Fifty years ago, nobody imagined what the world would be like today or what Singapore would be like today, and that we would have such a deep and broad relationship and so many things to do together.We would like to build on this for the next 50 years. It depends on how we\u2014each of our countries does: in Singapore, whether we are able to remain stable, prosperous, open, successful; in America, whether you remain one of the dynamic, vibrant, leading economies in the world, in a world in which there are other powers, other centers of creativity and technology and science and progress, but yet it's a unique participant with a history of contributing to the world not just for your own interests, but because you believe that the world should be a better place for all countries.And if America can do that, and if Singapore can maintain our success, then I think there are many opportunities for us to make common cause together. And then, the rebalancing, which the President has enunciated and executed, will sustain and endure for many years to come. It will be a very different world. The countries will grow; other countries will slow down. Demographics will have a big factor to come. I mean, if we look at Japan, their population has been shrinking, and they will have to do something, somehow, to turn it around. Otherwise, 50 more years of population shrinking and you have a very small country left in terms of economy, in terms of influence internationally.Singapore, too, has demographic issues. America has a demographic change\u2014the population is not shrinking, but the composition is changing. And in this situation, we have to adjust to a new world, maintaining our position and our ability to compete and yet knowing that it's not going to be the same as it was in 1946, when America was about half the world's GDP. So\u2014or one-quarter of the world's GDP.So that's the crucial factor over the next 50 years. As for what we do over bipartisan links, if there's a U.S. leader who is more closed off and wants to turn inward, I don't think this is the right forum or indeed there is any right forum for me to talk about U.S. politics in public at this moment. We will work with whoever is the U.S. administration, whichever party. We've worked with five Republican and four Democratic administrations. And our experience of American elections, Presidential elections, has been that many pressures build up during the election campaign. And after the elections, in a calmer, cooler atmosphere, positions are rethought, strategies are nuanced, and a certain balance is kept in the direction of the ship of state. It doesn't turn completely upside down.The Americans take pride in having a system with checks of\u2014with checks and balances so that it is not so easy to do things, but it is not so easy to completely mess things up. [] No. And we admire that, and sometimes, we depend upon that. [] The\u2014he's absolutely right. [] The wisdom of our Founders.With respect to military cooperation, obviously, Singapore is a small country, but as I've said before, it punches above its weight. Because so much of our work in the Asia-Pacific region is not a matter of active conflict, but rather creating an architecture, a framework of rules and norms that keeps the peace and that has underwritten security for the region and for us for many years now. And Singapore is so often the adult in the room, the level head, that can help us work with a wide range of countries around certain issues, help defuse tensions. In many ways, the diplomatic work and collaboration that we do with Singapore is as critical, if not more critical, than the work militarily.But what is also true is the nature of threats today, when you think of cyber threats or our concern about enforcing sanctions against North Korea to ensure nonproliferation of nuclear materials or being able to countermessage ISIL in a place like Southeast Asia and ensure information sharing with countries where there may be a budding terrorist threat, those are all issues of military finesse and intelligence and precision, and that\u2014those are areas where Singapore excels.So in addition to being a very important logistical hub and center for our operations, the partnership that we're able to maintain helps us to work with a whole range of other countries much more effectively than we would if Singapore weren't there and we were having to just try to gather up all these countries individually. And that's where ASEAN and the East Asia Summit, I think, has also been very important, because it is institutionalizing many of these practices in ways that, hopefully, avoids conflict in the first place, which would be in everybody's interest.With the\u2014as far as where the relationship goes, I think the Prime Minister is absolutely right: Fifty years from now, it's very hard to anticipate where we're going, but there are certain trends that I think are inevitable. The Asia-Pacific region will continue to grow and will continue to account for a larger share of the world's economy. There are going to be countries in the Southeast Asian region that look to follow the path of Singapore into a mature, advanced economy. It is going to be a big market. And the United States is still going to have a massive interest in maintaining itself as a Asia-Pacific power and in maintaining strong bonds of trade and commerce and scientific exchange and educational exchange.And given the close strategic interests, but maybe even more importantly, the close people-to-people ties between America and Singapore, I think we can anticipate that that will be just as strong 50 years from now as it is today.The\u2014Singapore has to take into account not just American interests. China is a big neighbor, and there are strong commercial ties and cultural ties there as well. And in that sense, Singapore actually can serve as a useful partner with us and with China to assure that the U.S.-Sino relationship moves in a productive way, which I think would be in the interests of both countries.So this is going to be a central engine for world growth. And if we do a good job in maintaining stability, ensuring a rules-based order, continuing to promote greater transparency and reducing corruption in the region so that all people are benefiting from the rapid growth that is taking place, then I think the future 50 years from now will be bright.Jordan Fabian [The Hill].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat role do you see Singapore playing in this context?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

It depends on how we\u2014each of our countries does: in Singapore, whether we are able to remain stable, prosperous, open, successful; in America, whether you remain one of the dynamic, vibrant, leading economies in the world, in a world in which there are other powers, other centers of creativity and technology and science and progress, but yet it's a unique participant with a history of contributing to the world not just for your own interests, but because you believe that the world should be a better place for all countries.And if America can do that, and if Singapore can maintain our success, then I think there are many opportunities for us to make common cause together. And then, the rebalancing, which the President has enunciated and executed, will sustain and endure for many years to come. It will be a very different world. The countries will grow; other countries will slow down. Demographics will have a big factor to come. I mean, if we look at Japan, their population has been shrinking, and they will have to do something, somehow, to turn it around. Otherwise, 50 more years of population shrinking and you have a very small country left in terms of economy, in terms of influence internationally.Singapore, too, has demographic issues. America has a demographic change\u2014the population is not shrinking, but the composition is changing. And in this situation, we have to adjust to a new world, maintaining our position and our ability to compete and yet knowing that it's not going to be the same as it was in 1946, when America was about half the world's GDP. So\u2014or one-quarter of the world's GDP.So that's the crucial factor over the next 50 years. As for what we do over bipartisan links, if there's a U.S. leader who is more closed off and wants to turn inward, I don't think this is the right forum or indeed there is any right forum for me to talk about U.S. politics in public at this moment. We will work with whoever is the U.S. administration, whichever party. We've worked with five Republican and four Democratic administrations. And our experience of American elections, Presidential elections, has been that many pressures build up during the election campaign. And after the elections, in a calmer, cooler atmosphere, positions are rethought, strategies are nuanced, and a certain balance is kept in the direction of the ship of state. It doesn't turn completely upside down.The Americans take pride in having a system with checks of\u2014with checks and balances so that it is not so easy to do things, but it is not so easy to completely mess things up. [] No. And we admire that, and sometimes, we depend upon that. [] The\u2014he's absolutely right. [] The wisdom of our Founders.With respect to military cooperation, obviously, Singapore is a small country, but as I've said before, it punches above its weight. Because so much of our work in the Asia-Pacific region is not a matter of active conflict, but rather creating an architecture, a framework of rules and norms that keeps the peace and that has underwritten security for the region and for us for many years now. And Singapore is so often the adult in the room, the level head, that can help us work with a wide range of countries around certain issues, help defuse tensions. In many ways, the diplomatic work and collaboration that we do with Singapore is as critical, if not more critical, than the work militarily.But what is also true is the nature of threats today, when you think of cyber threats or our concern about enforcing sanctions against North Korea to ensure nonproliferation of nuclear materials or being able to countermessage ISIL in a place like Southeast Asia and ensure information sharing with countries where there may be a budding terrorist threat, those are all issues of military finesse and intelligence and precision, and that\u2014those are areas where Singapore excels.So in addition to being a very important logistical hub and center for our operations, the partnership that we're able to maintain helps us to work with a whole range of other countries much more effectively than we would if Singapore weren't there and we were having to just try to gather up all these countries individually. And that's where ASEAN and the East Asia Summit, I think, has also been very important, because it is institutionalizing many of these practices in ways that, hopefully, avoids conflict in the first place, which would be in everybody's interest.With the\u2014as far as where the relationship goes, I think the Prime Minister is absolutely right: Fifty years from now, it's very hard to anticipate where we're going, but there are certain trends that I think are inevitable. The Asia-Pacific region will continue to grow and will continue to account for a larger share of the world's economy. There are going to be countries in the Southeast Asian region that look to follow the path of Singapore into a mature, advanced economy. It is going to be a big market. And the United States is still going to have a massive interest in maintaining itself as a Asia-Pacific power and in maintaining strong bonds of trade and commerce and scientific exchange and educational exchange.And given the close strategic interests, but maybe even more importantly, the close people-to-people ties between America and Singapore, I think we can anticipate that that will be just as strong 50 years from now as it is today.The\u2014Singapore has to take into account not just American interests. China is a big neighbor, and there are strong commercial ties and cultural ties there as well. And in that sense, Singapore actually can serve as a useful partner with us and with China to assure that the U.S.-Sino relationship moves in a productive way, which I think would be in the interests of both countries.So this is going to be a central engine for world growth. And if we do a good job in maintaining stability, ensuring a rules-based order, continuing to promote greater transparency and reducing corruption in the region so that all people are benefiting from the rapid growth that is taking place, then I think the future 50 years from now will be bright.Jordan Fabian [The Hill].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat are some of the hot-button issues that we're likely to face as the U.S. continues its rebalance?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to specifically ask about the Dallas shooting and the attacker there. Now that we know more about the man who, we believe, did those crimes, I'm wondering if you could help us understand how you describe his motives. Do you consider this an act of domestic terrorism? Was this a hate crime? Was this a mentally ill man with a gun? How should Americans understand why that happened? And then, also, on the issue of political division and looking for solutions, there have been some critics who noted that you immediately mentioned your call for gun control soon after the attacks. Do you think that in any way encourages or ensures that people retreat to their corners as they think about this?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes. First of all, I think it's very hard to untangle the motives of this shooter. As we've seen in a whole range of incidents with mass shooters, they are, by definition, troubled. By definition, if you shoot people who pose no threat to you\u2014strangers\u2014you have a troubled mind. What triggers that, what feeds it, what sets it off, I'll leave that to psychologists and people who study these kinds of incidents.What I can say is that although he may have used as an excuse his anger about previous incidents\u2014as has been indicated, at least, in the press, and as Chief Brown, I think, indicated\u2014in no way does that represent what the overwhelming majority of Americans think.Americans, to a large degree, want to make sure that we have a police force that is supported, because they know our police officers do a really tough, dangerous job. And witness the professionalism of our Dallas police officers. As they were being shot at, the fact that they helped to clear the area, they helped to get the fallen and the injured out of there, they were able to isolate the suspect, and that you didn't have other casualties as a consequence of the police shooting back\u2014that just gives you an indication of what a tough job they have and how well they do it on a regular basis.So I think the danger, as I said, is that we somehow suggest that the act of a troubled individual speaks to some larger political statement across the country. It doesn't. When some White kid walks into a church and shoots a bunch of worshippers who invite him to worship with them, we don't assume that somehow he's making a political statement that's relevant to the attitudes of the rest of America. And we shouldn't make those assumptions around a troubled Muslim individual who is acting on their own in that same way.Now, with respect to the issue of guns, I am going to keep on talking about the fact that we cannot eliminate all racial tension in our country overnight; we are not going to be able to identify ahead of time and eliminate every madman or troubled individual who might want to do harm against innocent people; but we can make it harder for them to do so.And if you look at the pattern of death and violence and shootings that we've experienced over the course of the last year or the last 5 years or the last 10 years\u2014I've said this before\u2014we are unique among advanced countries in the scale of violence that we experience. And I'm not just talking about mass shootings. I'm talking about the hundreds of people who have already been shot this year in my hometown of Chicago, the ones that we just consider routine.Now, we may not see that issue as connected to what happened in Dallas, but part of what's creating tensions between communities and the police is the fact that police have a really difficult time in communities where they know guns are everywhere. And as I said before, they have a right to come home, and now they have very little margin of error in terms of making decisions. So if you care about the safety of our police officers, then you can't set aside the gun issue and pretend that that's irrelevant.At the protest in Dallas, one of the challenges for the Dallas Police Department\u2014as they're being shot at\u2014is because this is an open-carry State, there are a bunch of people participating in the protest who have weapons on them. Imagine if you're a police officer and you're trying to sort out who is shooting at you and there are a bunch of people who have got guns on them.In Minneapolis, we don't know yet what happened, but we do know that there was a gun in the car that apparently was licensed, but it caused in some fashion those tragic events.So, no, we can't just ignore that and pretend that that's somehow political or the President is pushing his policy agenda. It is a contributing factor\u2014not the sole factor, but a contributing factor\u2014to the broader tensions that arise between police and the communities where they serve. And so we have to talk about that.And as I've said before, there is a way to talk about that that is consistent with our Constitution and the Second Amendment. The problem is, even mention of it somehow evokes this kind of polarization.And you're right, when it comes to the issue of gun safety, there is polarization between a very intense minority and a majority of Americans who actually think that we could be doing better when it comes to gun safety. But that expresses itself in stark terms when it comes to legislation in Congress or in State legislatures. And that's too bad. We're going to have to tackle that at some point. And I'm not going to stop talking about it, because if we don't talk about it, we're not going to solve these underlying problems. It's part of the problem.Carol Lee [Wall Street Journal].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo you consider this an act of domestic terrorism?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

And we shouldn't make those assumptions around a troubled Muslim individual who is acting on their own in that same way.Now, with respect to the issue of guns, I am going to keep on talking about the fact that we cannot eliminate all racial tension in our country overnight; we are not going to be able to identify ahead of time and eliminate every madman or troubled individual who might want to do harm against innocent people; but we can make it harder for them to do so.And if you look at the pattern of death and violence and shootings that we've experienced over the course of the last year or the last 5 years or the last 10 years\u2014I've said this before\u2014we are unique among advanced countries in the scale of violence that we experience. And I'm not just talking about mass shootings. I'm talking about the hundreds of people who have already been shot this year in my hometown of Chicago, the ones that we just consider routine.Now, we may not see that issue as connected to what happened in Dallas, but part of what's creating tensions between communities and the police is the fact that police have a really difficult time in communities where they know guns are everywhere. And as I said before, they have a right to come home, and now they have very little margin of error in terms of making decisions. So if you care about the safety of our police officers, then you can't set aside the gun issue and pretend that that's irrelevant.At the protest in Dallas, one of the challenges for the Dallas Police Department\u2014as they're being shot at\u2014is because this is an open-carry State, there are a bunch of people participating in the protest who have weapons on them. Imagine if you're a police officer and you're trying to sort out who is shooting at you and there are a bunch of people who have got guns on them.In Minneapolis, we don't know yet what happened, but we do know that there was a gun in the car that apparently was licensed, but it caused in some fashion those tragic events.So, no, we can't just ignore that and pretend that that's somehow political or the President is pushing his policy agenda. It is a contributing factor\u2014not the sole factor, but a contributing factor\u2014to the broader tensions that arise between police and the communities where they serve. And so we have to talk about that.And as I've said before, there is a way to talk about that that is consistent with our Constitution and the Second Amendment. The problem is, even mention of it somehow evokes this kind of polarization.And you're right, when it comes to the issue of gun safety, there is polarization between a very intense minority and a majority of Americans who actually think that we could be doing better when it comes to gun safety. But that expresses itself in stark terms when it comes to legislation in Congress or in State legislatures. And that's too bad. We're going to have to tackle that at some point. And I'm not going to stop talking about it, because if we don't talk about it, we're not going to solve these underlying problems.

Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to specifically ask about the Dallas shooting and the attacker there. Now that we know more about the man who, we believe, did those crimes, I'm wondering if you could help us understand how you describe his motives. Do you consider this an act of domestic terrorism? Was this a hate crime? Was this a mentally ill man with a gun? How should Americans understand why that happened? And then, also, on the issue of political division and looking for solutions, there have been some critics who noted that you immediately mentioned your call for gun control soon after the attacks. Do you think that in any way encourages or ensures that people retreat to their corners as they think about this?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes. First of all, I think it's very hard to untangle the motives of this shooter. As we've seen in a whole range of incidents with mass shooters, they are, by definition, troubled. By definition, if you shoot people who pose no threat to you\u2014strangers\u2014you have a troubled mind. What triggers that, what feeds it, what sets it off, I'll leave that to psychologists and people who study these kinds of incidents.What I can say is that although he may have used as an excuse his anger about previous incidents\u2014as has been indicated, at least, in the press, and as Chief Brown, I think, indicated\u2014in no way does that represent what the overwhelming majority of Americans think.Americans, to a large degree, want to make sure that we have a police force that is supported, because they know our police officers do a really tough, dangerous job. And witness the professionalism of our Dallas police officers. As they were being shot at, the fact that they helped to clear the area, they helped to get the fallen and the injured out of there, they were able to isolate the suspect, and that you didn't have other casualties as a consequence of the police shooting back\u2014that just gives you an indication of what a tough job they have and how well they do it on a regular basis.So I think the danger, as I said, is that we somehow suggest that the act of a troubled individual speaks to some larger political statement across the country. It doesn't. When some White kid walks into a church and shoots a bunch of worshippers who invite him to worship with them, we don't assume that somehow he's making a political statement that's relevant to the attitudes of the rest of America. And we shouldn't make those assumptions around a troubled Muslim individual who is acting on their own in that same way.Now, with respect to the issue of guns, I am going to keep on talking about the fact that we cannot eliminate all racial tension in our country overnight; we are not going to be able to identify ahead of time and eliminate every madman or troubled individual who might want to do harm against innocent people; but we can make it harder for them to do so.And if you look at the pattern of death and violence and shootings that we've experienced over the course of the last year or the last 5 years or the last 10 years\u2014I've said this before\u2014we are unique among advanced countries in the scale of violence that we experience.

And if I may, could I ask the other question, because I think it might get an interesting response. You, last May, passed a milestone in that you are now were President longer when the country was at war than your predecessor, George W. Bush. And if you complete your Presidency, as you will, with troops in Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq, you will be the only two-term President in American history to have served with the country at war. And I wonder, given the way that you ran for office and the aspirations you brought into office, how you feel about that reality? And then, a second follow-up on that: Should the American people simply resign themselves to living in a state of perpetual war, even if that war is not the all-out war that we think of in the 20th century?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nOkay. That was an interesting question so\u2014first of all, with respect to the State Department, I am concerned. And the challenge that we've got is primarily driven by the changing nature of how information flows. Look, the advent of e-mail and texts and smartphones is just generating enormous amounts of data. Now, it is hugely convenient. It means that in real time I'm getting information that some of my predecessors might not have gotten for weeks.But what it also is doing is creating this massive influx of information on a daily basis, putting enormous pressure on the Department to sort through it, classify it properly, figure out what are the various points of entry because of the cyber-attack risks that these systems have, knowing that our adversaries are constantly trying to hack into these various systems. If you overclassify, then all the advantages of this new information suddenly go away because it's taking too long to process. And so we've been trying to think about this in a smart way. And I think Secretary Kerry has got a range of initiatives to try to get our arms around this. It reflects a larger problem in Government. We just recently, for example\u2014I just recently signed a bill about FOIA requests, Freedom of Information Act requests, that built on a number of reforms that we've put in place. We're processing more Freedom of Information Act requests and doing so faster than ever before. The problem is the volume of requests has skyrocketed. The amount of information that answers the request has multiplied exponentially.So, across Government, you're seeing this problem. And it's a problem in terms of domestic affairs. It becomes an even bigger problem when you're talking about national security issues. So it is something that we're going to have to take care of.With respect to reflections on war, when I came into office, we had 180,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, we have a fraction of that. They are not involved in active combat situations, but are involved in train, advise, and assist situations, other than the direct attacks that we launch against ISIL in conjunction with the Iraq Government and the Syrian Government [partners on the ground in Syria; White House correction.].So, in some ways, Mark, I think you'd recognize that our military operations today in Iraq and Afghanistan are fundamentally different than the wars that we were engaged in when I came into office. But I think you are making an important point, which is when we are dealing with nonstate actors, and those nonstate actors are located in countries with limited capacity, our ultimate goal is to partner with those countries so that they can secure their borders and, themselves, eliminate these terrorist threats.But as we've seen in Afghanistan, for example, that takes some time. The Afghans are fighting. They are much more capable now than they were when I came into office. But they still need support, because it's really tough territory, and it's a really poor country with really low literacy rates and not much experience in things that we take for granted like logistics.And so we have an option of going in, taking out Al aida, pulling out, potentially then seeing a country crumble under the strains of continued terrorist activity or insurgency, and then going back in. Or we can try to maintain a limited partnership that allows them to continue to build their capacity over time and selectively take our own actions against those organizations that we know are trying to attack us or our allies.Because they're nonstate actors, it's very hard for us ever to get the satisfaction of McArthur and the Emperor meeting and a war officially being over. AI was defeated in the sense that we were able to execute a transition to a democratically elected Iraqi Government. But for all of our efforts and the incredible courage and bravery and sacrifice of our troops, the political structure there was still uneven. You had continued Sunni resentments, continued de-Baathification, and as a consequence, those vestiges of AI were able to reconstitute themselves, move into Syria as Syria began to engage in civil war, rebuild, and then come back in.Some have argued that this is the reason why we should have never pulled out of Iraq, or at least, we should have left some larger presence there. Of course, the problem was that we didn't have an Iraqi Government that wanted them, unlike Afghanistan, where we've been invited. And it's very difficult for us to\u2014for me, as Commander in Chief, to want to put our troops in a precarious situation where they're not protected. So I think what we've been trying to do, what I've been trying to do, is to create an architecture, a structure\u2014and it's not there yet\u2014that emphasizes partnerships with countries, emphasizes building up fragile states, resolving internal conflicts wherever we can, trying to do as much as we can through our local partners, preserving the possibility, the necessity to take strikes ourselves against organizations or individuals that we know are trying to kill Americans or Belgians or French or Germans, combine that with much more effective intelligence gathering. But it becomes more of a hybrid approach to national security. And that I do think is probably going to be something that we have to continue to grapple with for years to come.The good news is that there are fewer wars between states than ever before and almost no wars between great powers. And that's a great legacy of leaders in the United States and Europe and Asia, after the cold war\u2014or after the end of World War II that built this international architecture. That's worked. And we should be proud of that and preserve it.But this different kind of low-grade threat, one that's not an existential threat, but can do real damage and real harm to our societies and creates the kind of fear that can cause division and political reactions\u2014we have to do that better. We have to continually refine it.So, for example, the reason that I put out our announcement about the civilian casualties resulting from drone attacks\u2014understanding that there are those who dispute the numbers\u2014what I'm trying to do there is to institutionalize a system where we begin to hold ourselves accountable for this different kind of national security threat and these different kinds of operations.And it's imperfect, still. But I think we can get there. And what I can say honestly is, whether we're talking about how the NSA operates or how drone strikes operate or how we're partnering with other countries or my efforts to close Guantanamo, that by the end of my Presidency\u2014or banning torture\u2014by the end of my Presidency, I feel confident that these efforts will be on a firmer legal footing, more consistent with international law and norms, more reflective of our values and our ethics. But we're going to have more work to do. It's not perfect, and we have to wrestle with these issues all the time.And as Commander in Chief of the most powerful military in the world, I spend a lot of time brooding over these issues. And I'm not satisfied that we've got it perfect yet. I can say honestly, it's better than it was when I came into office.Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Poland.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow do you feel about the fact that last May, you passed a milestone where you became President longer than your predecessor, George W.

They are not involved in active combat situations, but are involved in train, advise, and assist situations, other than the direct attacks that we launch against ISIL in conjunction with the Iraq Government and the Syrian Government [partners on the ground in Syria; White House correction.].So, in some ways, Mark, I think you'd recognize that our military operations today in Iraq and Afghanistan are fundamentally different than the wars that we were engaged in when I came into office. But I think you are making an important point, which is when we are dealing with nonstate actors, and those nonstate actors are located in countries with limited capacity, our ultimate goal is to partner with those countries so that they can secure their borders and, themselves, eliminate these terrorist threats.But as we've seen in Afghanistan, for example, that takes some time. The Afghans are fighting. They are much more capable now than they were when I came into office. But they still need support, because it's really tough territory, and it's a really poor country with really low literacy rates and not much experience in things that we take for granted like logistics.And so we have an option of going in, taking out Al aida, pulling out, potentially then seeing a country crumble under the strains of continued terrorist activity or insurgency, and then going back in. Or we can try to maintain a limited partnership that allows them to continue to build their capacity over time and selectively take our own actions against those organizations that we know are trying to attack us or our allies.Because they're nonstate actors, it's very hard for us ever to get the satisfaction of McArthur and the Emperor meeting and a war officially being over. AI was defeated in the sense that we were able to execute a transition to a democratically elected Iraqi Government. But for all of our efforts and the incredible courage and bravery and sacrifice of our troops, the political structure there was still uneven. You had continued Sunni resentments, continued de-Baathification, and as a consequence, those vestiges of AI were able to reconstitute themselves, move into Syria as Syria began to engage in civil war, rebuild, and then come back in.Some have argued that this is the reason why we should have never pulled out of Iraq, or at least, we should have left some larger presence there. Of course, the problem was that we didn't have an Iraqi Government that wanted them, unlike Afghanistan, where we've been invited. And it's very difficult for us to\u2014for me, as Commander in Chief, to want to put our troops in a precarious situation where they're not protected. So I think what we've been trying to do, what I've been trying to do, is to create an architecture, a structure\u2014and it's not there yet\u2014that emphasizes partnerships with countries, emphasizes building up fragile states, resolving internal conflicts wherever we can, trying to do as much as we can through our local partners, preserving the possibility, the necessity to take strikes ourselves against organizations or individuals that we know are trying to kill Americans or Belgians or French or Germans, combine that with much more effective intelligence gathering. But it becomes more of a hybrid approach to national security. And that I do think is probably going to be something that we have to continue to grapple with for years to come.The good news is that there are fewer wars between states than ever before and almost no wars between great powers. And that's a great legacy of leaders in the United States and Europe and Asia, after the cold war\u2014or after the end of World War II that built this international architecture. That's worked. And we should be proud of that and preserve it.But this different kind of low-grade threat, one that's not an existential threat, but can do real damage and real harm to our societies and creates the kind of fear that can cause division and political reactions\u2014we have to do that better. We have to continually refine it.So, for example, the reason that I put out our announcement about the civilian casualties resulting from drone attacks\u2014understanding that there are those who dispute the numbers\u2014what I'm trying to do there is to institutionalize a system where we begin to hold ourselves accountable for this different kind of national security threat and these different kinds of operations.And it's imperfect, still. But I think we can get there. And what I can say honestly is, whether we're talking about how the NSA operates or how drone strikes operate or how we're partnering with other countries or my efforts to close Guantanamo, that by the end of my Presidency\u2014or banning torture\u2014by the end of my Presidency, I feel confident that these efforts will be on a firmer legal footing, more consistent with international law and norms, more reflective of our values and our ethics. But we're going to have more work to do. It's not perfect, and we have to wrestle with these issues all the time.And as Commander in Chief of the most powerful military in the world, I spend a lot of time brooding over these issues. And I'm not satisfied that we've got it perfect yet. I can say honestly, it's better than it was when I came into office.Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Poland.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nGiven the way you ran for office and the aspirations you brought into office, how do you feel about the reality of serving as President during times of war?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

And if I may, could I ask the other question, because I think it might get an interesting response. You, last May, passed a milestone in that you are now were President longer when the country was at war than your predecessor, George W. Bush. And if you complete your Presidency, as you will, with troops in Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq, you will be the only two-term President in American history to have served with the country at war. And I wonder, given the way that you ran for office and the aspirations you brought into office, how you feel about that reality? And then, a second follow-up on that: Should the American people simply resign themselves to living in a state of perpetual war, even if that war is not the all-out war that we think of in the 20th century?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nOkay. That was an interesting question so\u2014first of all, with respect to the State Department, I am concerned. And the challenge that we've got is primarily driven by the changing nature of how information flows. Look, the advent of e-mail and texts and smartphones is just generating enormous amounts of data. Now, it is hugely convenient. It means that in real time I'm getting information that some of my predecessors might not have gotten for weeks.But what it also is doing is creating this massive influx of information on a daily basis, putting enormous pressure on the Department to sort through it, classify it properly, figure out what are the various points of entry because of the cyber-attack risks that these systems have, knowing that our adversaries are constantly trying to hack into these various systems. If you overclassify, then all the advantages of this new information suddenly go away because it's taking too long to process. And so we've been trying to think about this in a smart way. And I think Secretary Kerry has got a range of initiatives to try to get our arms around this. It reflects a larger problem in Government. We just recently, for example\u2014I just recently signed a bill about FOIA requests, Freedom of Information Act requests, that built on a number of reforms that we've put in place. We're processing more Freedom of Information Act requests and doing so faster than ever before. The problem is the volume of requests has skyrocketed. The amount of information that answers the request has multiplied exponentially.So, across Government, you're seeing this problem. And it's a problem in terms of domestic affairs. It becomes an even bigger problem when you're talking about national security issues. So it is something that we're going to have to take care of.With respect to reflections on war, when I came into office, we had 180,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, we have a fraction of that. They are not involved in active combat situations, but are involved in train, advise, and assist situations, other than the direct attacks that we launch against ISIL in conjunction with the Iraq Government and the Syrian Government [partners on the ground in Syria; White House correction.].So, in some ways, Mark, I think you'd recognize that our military operations today in Iraq and Afghanistan are fundamentally different than the wars that we were engaged in when I came into office.

Thank you, Mr. President. Given how the Brexit vote shook the stability of the global economy, do you feel that you need to do more to calm the markets quickly and perhaps encourage a quick exit, rather than something that's long and drawn out? Do you still feel that the U.K. should be at the back of the queue for a trade deal with the United States? And are you going to make a full-throated pitch for the TPP, for your prescription, when you're out on the campaign trail this summer, stumping for Secretary Clinton?And, Prime Minister Trudeau, both\u2014I mean, you seem to be quite careful when you talk about Mr. Trump. Renegotiating NAFTA or tearing it up would be such a disaster for Canada. Why not come out and say that forcefully?And, President Pe\u00f1a Nieto, in March you compared Mr. Trump to Hitler and Mussolini. I'm wondering if you still stand by that. And how worried are you that this time next year there will be a wall up on your border?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nOkay. [] Excellent questions, Roberta. She doesn't sound Canadian. [] That was pretty mean. [] Canadians are a little more subtle. []I'm actually going to help out my friends a little bit on your last question, even though it wasn't directed at me, and just say, when I visit other countries, it's not my job to comment on candidates in the middle of a race, just because they may end up winning. And the relationship between governments tend to transcend whoever is in power at any given time. So it's a tough question. It's\u2014I'm not saying they shouldn't answer it, I'm just\u2014I'm helping them out a little bit. [] Because there's no doubt that when I visit countries, there are times where I've got preferences, but I'd rarely express them.With respect to Brexit, first of all, I think you've seen the markets settle down a little bit over the last couple of days. I didn't follow the markets today. But we're monitoring very carefully whether there's any systemic strains on the system. And so far, what you've seen is reactions in the market, stock prices, currencies. But I think the preparations that were done by central banks and Finance Ministers, our Treasury Secretary, indicate the degree to which the global economy in the short run will hold steady. I think there are some genuine longer term concerns about global growth if in fact Brexit goes through and that freezes the possibilities of investment in Great Britain or in Europe as a whole. At a time when global growth rates were weak already, this doesn't help.And so when we attend the G-20 summit in China later this year, one of the major topics\u2014which is something that I've continually advocated for during the 7\u00bd years that I've been President\u2014is we all have to look at what we can do to boost global demand: whether it's the United States adopting a more robust budget for infrastructure improvements and fixing water systems in Flint, Michigan, or repairing airports that are not as efficient as they should be or rebuilding our power grid so that it can take advantage of clean energy; whether it's Germany, a country with a surplus, doing more in terms of spending, or Europe as a whole lifting some of the austerity constraints that have been placed on them; whether it's China shifting to a more consumer-based, domestic-based growth strategy as opposed to trying to export its way out of problems. There are going to be a whole host of measures that all of us can take to fortify the global economy, and that should be a top priority of ours.With respect to the actual Brexit negotiations, my main message to David Cameron, Angela Merkel and others is: Everybody should catch their breath, come up with a plan and a process that is orderly, that's transparent, that people understand, and then proceed, understanding that both sides have a stake in getting this right. And I think that that will be a difficult, challenging process, but it does not need to be a panicky process. I think it can be a steady, sensible process.Obviously, leadership issues in Great Britain will need to be resolved for it to move as crisply and as effectively as it needs to, but that\u2014I think that's recognized, and that should happen fairly quickly. And I know that, speaking with Chancellor Merkel, that her interest is not in retribution, her interest is in making sure that the process works. And I have a lot of confidence in people being able to do that. And we will help in any way that we can to facilitate that.And then, the last part of your question is with respect to the U.K. and any trade agreement with the United States. Frankly, we will be the least of their problems right now, because their first order of business is going to be to address the market where they sell half their goods, which is Europe. And these things are not easily negotiated, particularly because we've been spending our time trying to negotiate with the European Union. And so to suddenly go off on another track will be challenging. But I think their first and primary concern is going to be to try to figure out how they interact with the European Union and the European market if in fact\u2014and when in fact\u2014they leave.I have emphasized throughout, though, that the special relationship that we have with Great Britain does not change; that the ties of affection and family and language and institutions and culture and the business relationships that exist, those are so deep and so long lasting\u2014the cooperation we have on security issues and on global challenges, those are so fundamental\u2014that our relationship with the U.K. fundamentally doesn't change.We are concerned that their absence from the European Union and the potential disruptions within Europe make it harder for us to solve some of the other challenges that have to be solved.[.] One of the things that's easy to forget amid the inflated rhetoric of an election campaign is that the relationship between our three countries goes far deeper than any individual leaders. And if the three of us get along, it's not just because we're aligned in many different values and priorities, it is very much because we serve citizens who are, they themselves, tremendously aligned in terms of priorities, in terms of hopes and dreams, in terms of desire for success and ways to reach it.So when you look at the level of integration, of our supply chains, of our markets, of the flow back and forward across borders of goods, of people, and the tremendous benefits that have come from proximity and strong relationships to individual citizens across this continent, it's essential that we understand that regardless of electoral rhetoric, Canada, the United States, and Mexico will continue to have tremendously close relationships economically, culturally, socially, familialy, historically, and towards the future.So as I've said many times, and I'll say again, I look forward to working with whomever the American people choose to elect as their President in November. I know that we will always be able to find shared priorities and challenges that we want to work together to overcome. And I know that our commitment to doing what's right and what's best for our citizens will lead us to much more alignment than differentiation. Roberta, I'll go straight to the point to describe the stand of my administration and my own very personal point of view. I've said it, and I'll say it again: My Government will respect fully the domestic electoral process in the United States. I don't think I've said anything different from what I'm stating once again here. What I have said is that today\u2014and I did not make reference to a specific place\u2014my words reinforce what I believe.I believe that in this global scenario\u2014and I'll use President Obama's words, and as he said, he gave us a hand to address this question\u2014we are facing a global reality. We have a populist world, an interconnected world with its own challenges. What I have said is that, in the world we're living, in different places, we have political leaders, political stakeholders that use demagoguery and have the populistic slogans that want to eliminate and destroy what has been built, what has taken decades to build to go back to problems of the past. And yes, it is true, all the benefits have not reached society as we whole. That is true. But those leaderships, those political actors, by using populism and demagoguery, they choose the easiest way to solve the challenges of today's world. And things are not that simplistic. It's not as easy as that. To lead a country, to take on a responsibility to rule a country, it goes beyond giving the easiest answer. It is complex and it is difficult to lead a country.And I just said it: What we have reached so far\u2014the level of development, the level of well-being that we have in the world\u2014without a doubt makes contrast with what the situation that we lived 30 years back. Never before a global society\u2014or the societies, at least, of our three countries\u2014had lived the level of development and well-being that we enjoy today. Never before had our countries had a high life expectancy as we have today. Never before had we had the opportunity to have access to the knowledge of the world as fast and as easy as we do today. Never before were in such a level of connection between society and the possibility of having access to any product from any corner of the world as we do today. And that was built throughout the years by using the model based on openness, free trade, trade agreements.And the biggest challenge today is to make sure that those benefits reach out to every single citizen. But the solution proposed by some is not by destroying what we have been built, it is not taking a different route to choose the road towards isolationism and destruction. What we need to do is to keep up the pace towards development. And when I said that, I mentioned that most of what some people say, it is very similar that in the past\u2014and President Obama already said it, even years back\u2014but in the past, some leaders addressed their societies in those terms. Hitler and Mussolini did that. And the outcome, it's clear to everyone: It resulted in devastation, and it turned out to be a tragedy for mankind. And we saw it last century.That was my message when I made reference to this event. My message was about to value what we have and also to be aware of the road that we need to walk still. But that's the benefit that we're looking forward to: take the benefits to our societies.[ spoke in English as follows.] [Inaudible]\u2014last question.[.]The question will be from Mr. Philippe-Vincent Foisy of Cogeco News.[.]\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nPosition on trade deal with the U.K.\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

I think it can be a steady, sensible process.Obviously, leadership issues in Great Britain will need to be resolved for it to move as crisply and as effectively as it needs to, but that\u2014I think that's recognized, and that should happen fairly quickly. And I know that, speaking with Chancellor Merkel, that her interest is not in retribution, her interest is in making sure that the process works. And I have a lot of confidence in people being able to do that. And we will help in any way that we can to facilitate that.And then, the last part of your question is with respect to the U.K. and any trade agreement with the United States. Frankly, we will be the least of their problems right now, because their first order of business is going to be to address the market where they sell half their goods, which is Europe. And these things are not easily negotiated, particularly because we've been spending our time trying to negotiate with the European Union. And so to suddenly go off on another track will be challenging. But I think their first and primary concern is going to be to try to figure out how they interact with the European Union and the European market if in fact\u2014and when in fact\u2014they leave.I have emphasized throughout, though, that the special relationship that we have with Great Britain does not change; that the ties of affection and family and language and institutions and culture and the business relationships that exist, those are so deep and so long lasting\u2014the cooperation we have on security issues and on global challenges, those are so fundamental\u2014that our relationship with the U.K. fundamentally doesn't change.We are concerned that their absence from the European Union and the potential disruptions within Europe make it harder for us to solve some of the other challenges that have to be solved.[.] One of the things that's easy to forget amid the inflated rhetoric of an election campaign is that the relationship between our three countries goes far deeper than any individual leaders. And if the three of us get along, it's not just because we're aligned in many different values and priorities, it is very much because we serve citizens who are, they themselves, tremendously aligned in terms of priorities, in terms of hopes and dreams, in terms of desire for success and ways to reach it.So when you look at the level of integration, of our supply chains, of our markets, of the flow back and forward across borders of goods, of people, and the tremendous benefits that have come from proximity and strong relationships to individual citizens across this continent, it's essential that we understand that regardless of electoral rhetoric, Canada, the United States, and Mexico will continue to have tremendously close relationships economically, culturally, socially, familialy, historically, and towards the future.So as I've said many times, and I'll say again, I look forward to working with whomever the American people choose to elect as their President in November. I know that we will always be able to find shared priorities and challenges that we want to work together to overcome. And I know that our commitment to doing what's right and what's best for our citizens will lead us to much more alignment than differentiation. Roberta, I'll go straight to the point to describe the stand of my administration and my own very personal point of view. I've said it, and I'll say it again: My Government will respect fully the domestic electoral process in the United States. I don't think I've said anything different from what I'm stating once again here. What I have said is that today\u2014and I did not make reference to a specific place\u2014my words reinforce what I believe.I believe that in this global scenario\u2014and I'll use President Obama's words, and as he said, he gave us a hand to address this question\u2014we are facing a global reality. We have a populist world, an interconnected world with its own challenges. What I have said is that, in the world we're living, in different places, we have political leaders, political stakeholders that use demagoguery and have the populistic slogans that want to eliminate and destroy what has been built, what has taken decades to build to go back to problems of the past. And yes, it is true, all the benefits have not reached society as we whole. That is true. But those leaderships, those political actors, by using populism and demagoguery, they choose the easiest way to solve the challenges of today's world. And things are not that simplistic. It's not as easy as that. To lead a country, to take on a responsibility to rule a country, it goes beyond giving the easiest answer. It is complex and it is difficult to lead a country.And I just said it: What we have reached so far\u2014the level of development, the level of well-being that we have in the world\u2014without a doubt makes contrast with what the situation that we lived 30 years back. Never before a global society\u2014or the societies, at least, of our three countries\u2014had lived the level of development and well-being that we enjoy today. Never before had our countries had a high life expectancy as we have today. Never before had we had the opportunity to have access to the knowledge of the world as fast and as easy as we do today. Never before were in such a level of connection between society and the possibility of having access to any product from any corner of the world as we do today. And that was built throughout the years by using the model based on openness, free trade, trade agreements.And the biggest challenge today is to make sure that those benefits reach out to every single citizen. But the solution proposed by some is not by destroying what we have been built, it is not taking a different route to choose the road towards isolationism and destruction. What we need to do is to keep up the pace towards development. And when I said that, I mentioned that most of what some people say, it is very similar that in the past\u2014and President Obama already said it, even years back\u2014but in the past, some leaders addressed their societies in those terms. Hitler and Mussolini did that. And the outcome, it's clear to everyone: It resulted in devastation, and it turned out to be a tragedy for mankind. And we saw it last century.That was my message when I made reference to this event. My message was about to value what we have and also to be aware of the road that we need to walk still. But that's the benefit that we're looking forward to: take the benefits to our societies.[ spoke in English as follows.] [Inaudible]\u2014last question.[.]The question will be from Mr. Philippe-Vincent Foisy of Cogeco News.[.]\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nCalming the markets and encouraging a quick Brexit exit\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Thank you, Mr. President. Given how the Brexit vote shook the stability of the global economy, do you feel that you need to do more to calm the markets quickly and perhaps encourage a quick exit, rather than something that's long and drawn out? Do you still feel that the U.K. should be at the back of the queue for a trade deal with the United States? And are you going to make a full-throated pitch for the TPP, for your prescription, when you're out on the campaign trail this summer, stumping for Secretary Clinton?And, Prime Minister Trudeau, both\u2014I mean, you seem to be quite careful when you talk about Mr. Trump. Renegotiating NAFTA or tearing it up would be such a disaster for Canada. Why not come out and say that forcefully?And, President Pe\u00f1a Nieto, in March you compared Mr. Trump to Hitler and Mussolini. I'm wondering if you still stand by that. And how worried are you that this time next year there will be a wall up on your border?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nOkay. [] Excellent questions, Roberta. She doesn't sound Canadian. [] That was pretty mean. [] Canadians are a little more subtle. []I'm actually going to help out my friends a little bit on your last question, even though it wasn't directed at me, and just say, when I visit other countries, it's not my job to comment on candidates in the middle of a race, just because they may end up winning. And the relationship between governments tend to transcend whoever is in power at any given time. So it's a tough question. It's\u2014I'm not saying they shouldn't answer it, I'm just\u2014I'm helping them out a little bit. [] Because there's no doubt that when I visit countries, there are times where I've got preferences, but I'd rarely express them.With respect to Brexit, first of all, I think you've seen the markets settle down a little bit over the last couple of days. I didn't follow the markets today. But we're monitoring very carefully whether there's any systemic strains on the system. And so far, what you've seen is reactions in the market, stock prices, currencies. But I think the preparations that were done by central banks and Finance Ministers, our Treasury Secretary, indicate the degree to which the global economy in the short run will hold steady. I think there are some genuine longer term concerns about global growth if in fact Brexit goes through and that freezes the possibilities of investment in Great Britain or in Europe as a whole. At a time when global growth rates were weak already, this doesn't help.And so when we attend the G-20 summit in China later this year, one of the major topics\u2014which is something that I've continually advocated for during the 7\u00bd years that I've been President\u2014is we all have to look at what we can do to boost global demand: whether it's the United States adopting a more robust budget for infrastructure improvements and fixing water systems in Flint, Michigan, or repairing airports that are not as efficient as they should be or rebuilding our power grid so that it can take advantage of clean energy; whether it's Germany, a country with a surplus, doing more in terms of spending, or Europe as a whole lifting some of the austerity constraints that have been placed on them; whether it's China shifting to a more consumer-based, domestic-based growth strategy as opposed to trying to export its way out of problems. There are going to be a whole host of measures that all of us can take to fortify the global economy, and that should be a top priority of ours.With respect to the actual Brexit negotiations, my main message to David Cameron, Angela Merkel and others is: Everybody should catch their breath, come up with a plan and a process that is orderly, that's transparent, that people understand, and then proceed, understanding that both sides have a stake in getting this right.

President Obama, the Trans-Pacific Partnership seems fairly stalled in Congress, and other countries are looking to follow the U.S. lead in terms of how they advance their approval of the agreement. With the deals today announced for Boeing and GE and your visit here to Vietnam, are you looking to change your strategy in how you seek approval for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in Congress? And do you think that the agreement should be amended to address currency manipulation?Secondly, President Obama, can you comment on the killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansur and on Pakistan's concern about that strike happening on its soil? Can you also comment on whether this signals a new offensive in Afghanistan and whether you're concerned that an even more hardline leader might take his place?For President Quang, are you concerned about the lack of enthusiasm for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the U.S. Congress and what that means for the deal in the end? And how do you respond to China's criticism of the U.S. pursuing what China says is a one-sided, selfish agenda in Asia that risks regional peace?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nSo, first of ll, on TPP, Angel, I hven't been round s long s Sentors Crper or Secretry Kerry, but I've spent enough tie in the Sente to know tht every trde del is pinful, becuse folks re lwys seeing if they cn get n even better del. And especilly when you hve ultiple prties involved, folks re going to be scrutinizing it, they're going to be debting it, nd in n election yer, you cn nticipte tht soe folks re going to try to score politicl points off it.Hving sid tht, I rein confident we're going to get it done. And the reson I' confident is becuse it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country. It's good for Aeric. It's good for the regio It's good for the world.And I know I've sold this to you before, but let e reiterte: This is the fstest growing prt of the world. This represents n enorous rket for the United Sttes. Most countries here lredy sell their stuff to the United Sttes, nd we hve reltively low triffs. In other words, we put reltively low txes on goods tht re coing into the United Sttes. In contrst, triffs re significntly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So del tht gets rid of 18,000 txes on U.S. goods into the lrgest, fstest growing rkets of the world, tht's good del for Aericn businesses nd Aericn workers.Nuber two, one of the biggest coplints bout trde dels historiclly hs been tht it opens up our rkets to countries with lower wges, hrsher lbor prctices, less environentl regultio Well, if you're signing up for the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, you re king coitents tht re enforceble to rise lbor stndrds, to ensure tht workers hve voice, to ttend to environentl probles. And so this gives us the bility to engge with country like Vietn nd work with the on ll those fronts, the precise things tht people, in the pst, hve been concerned bout when it coes to trding with other countries.So I hve not yet seen credible rguent tht once we get TPP in plce we're going to be worse off. We re deonstrbly better off. Aericn workers nd Aericn businesses re better off if we get this del pssed. And I' confident we will get it pssed.Now, the politics of it will be noisy. Tht ws true when I, for exple, inherited the Koren free trde greeent or the Colobin nd Pnnin free trde greeents when I ce into office. But we got the done. And I' confident tht we'll get the done this tie, s well, lthough it will\u2014there will be ups nd downs nd bups long the wy.With respect to currency nipultion, we hve provisions in TPP tht dvnce the trnsprency nd reporting functions tht llow us to onitor whether we think tht currency nipultion is tking plce. One of the debtes tht took plce\u2014nd there hve been soe who rgue tht we should hve enforceble provisions tht if you see currency going down too fr tht we should be ble to ipose triffs on tht country. The proble is, is tht it's very hrd to sort out soeties why currency is going down nd whether it's ctully being nipulted. And frnkly, for us to bind other countries to coitents bout their onetry policy would en we were lso binding our Federl Reserve to the clis of other countries in ters of how it ipleents our onetry policy, nd tht's not soething tht we would do. We would not give up sovereignty with respect to our onetry policy in tht wy. But we hve strengthened nuber of the provisions tht re lredy contined in TPP tht will llow us to put on notice folks who we think re engging in copetitive devlutions.Finlly, on the Tlibn leder, Mr. Mnsur, it hs been confired tht he is ded. And he is n individul who, s hed of the Tlibn, ws specificlly trgeting U.S. personnel nd troops inside of Afghnistn who were there s prt of the ission tht I've set to be ble to intin counterterroris pltfor nd provide ssistnce nd trining to the Afghn ilitry forces there. So this does not represent shift in our pproch. We re not reentering the dy-to-dy cobt opertions tht re currently being conducted by Afghn security forces. Our job is to help Afghnistn secure its own country, not to hve our en nd woen in unifor engge in tht fight for the.On the other hnd, where we hve high-profile leder who hs been consistently prt of opertions nd plns to potentilly hr U.S. personnel nd who hs been resistnt to the kinds of pece tlks nd reconcilition tht ultitely could bring n end to decdes of wr in Afghnistn, then it is y responsibility s Conder in Chief not to stnd by, but to ke sure tht we send cler signl to the Tlibn nd others tht we're going to protect our people. And tht's exctly the essge tht hs been sent. President ung. Let e respond to this question concerning the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, TPP. In our view, TPP is significnt trde nd econoic linkge, contributing to sustining the dynis nd the role s driver for econoic growth in our country, s well s in the Asi-Pcific regio And for Vietn, TPP nd Vietn's prticiption in TPP is one step undertken by the Vietnese Governent in our process of extensive interntionl integrtio President Ob. Mr. President, sorry to interrupt. We're not getting trnsltio Testing one, two, three. President Ob. For you? Cn you her, Mr. President? President Ob. Oky. Testing one, two, three. President Ob. It's just, I' sure tht he ws sying soething very wise nd iportnt, nd we wnted to ke sure tht we ll herd it. President ung. So I would like to dd tht Vietn, together with other TPP countries, hve been king efforts to nrrow differences, to proote coopertion in the spirit of utul understnding nd utul respect. And we will try to reduce differences in spirit of constructiveness nd understnding nd pying ttention to one nother's legitite interests. And the finliztion of TPP is lso the successful outcoes of ll 12 ebers of the TPP, rther thn ny individul effort. And we re prepred to rtify TPP, nd we stnd redy to ipleent ll the coitents under TPP.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo you think that the agreement should be amended to address currency manipulation?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

In other words, we put reltively low txes on goods tht re coing into the United Sttes. In contrst, triffs re significntly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So del tht gets rid of 18,000 txes on U.S. goods into the lrgest, fstest growing rkets of the world, tht's good del for Aericn businesses nd Aericn workers.Nuber two, one of the biggest coplints bout trde dels historiclly hs been tht it opens up our rkets to countries with lower wges, hrsher lbor prctices, less environentl regultio Well, if you're signing up for the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, you re king coitents tht re enforceble to rise lbor stndrds, to ensure tht workers hve voice, to ttend to environentl probles. And so this gives us the bility to engge with country like Vietn nd work with the on ll those fronts, the precise things tht people, in the pst, hve been concerned bout when it coes to trding with other countries.So I hve not yet seen credible rguent tht once we get TPP in plce we're going to be worse off. We re deonstrbly better off. Aericn workers nd Aericn businesses re better off if we get this del pssed. And I' confident we will get it pssed.Now, the politics of it will be noisy. Tht ws true when I, for exple, inherited the Koren free trde greeent or the Colobin nd Pnnin free trde greeents when I ce into office. But we got the done. And I' confident tht we'll get the done this tie, s well, lthough it will\u2014there will be ups nd downs nd bups long the wy.With respect to currency nipultion, we hve provisions in TPP tht dvnce the trnsprency nd reporting functions tht llow us to onitor whether we think tht currency nipultion is tking plce. One of the debtes tht took plce\u2014nd there hve been soe who rgue tht we should hve enforceble provisions tht if you see currency going down too fr tht we should be ble to ipose triffs on tht country. The proble is, is tht it's very hrd to sort out soeties why currency is going down nd whether it's ctully being nipulted. And frnkly, for us to bind other countries to coitents bout their onetry policy would en we were lso binding our Federl Reserve to the clis of other countries in ters of how it ipleents our onetry policy, nd tht's not soething tht we would do. We would not give up sovereignty with respect to our onetry policy in tht wy. But we hve strengthened nuber of the provisions tht re lredy contined in TPP tht will llow us to put on notice folks who we think re engging in copetitive devlutions.Finlly, on the Tlibn leder, Mr. Mnsur, it hs been confired tht he is ded. And he is n individul who, s hed of the Tlibn, ws specificlly trgeting U.S. personnel nd troops inside of Afghnistn who were there s prt of the ission tht I've set to be ble to intin counterterroris pltfor nd provide ssistnce nd trining to the Afghn ilitry forces there. So this does not represent shift in our pproch. We re not reentering the dy-to-dy cobt opertions tht re currently being conducted by Afghn security forces. Our job is to help Afghnistn secure its own country, not to hve our en nd woen in unifor engge in tht fight for the.On the other hnd, where we hve high-profile leder who hs been consistently prt of opertions nd plns to potentilly hr U.S. personnel nd who hs been resistnt to the kinds of pece tlks nd reconcilition tht ultitely could bring n end to decdes of wr in Afghnistn, then it is y responsibility s Conder in Chief not to stnd by, but to ke sure tht we send cler signl to the Tlibn nd others tht we're going to protect our people. And tht's exctly the essge tht hs been sent. President ung. Let e respond to this question concerning the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, TPP. In our view, TPP is significnt trde nd econoic linkge, contributing to sustining the dynis nd the role s driver for econoic growth in our country, s well s in the Asi-Pcific regio And for Vietn, TPP nd Vietn's prticiption in TPP is one step undertken by the Vietnese Governent in our process of extensive interntionl integrtio President Ob. Mr. President, sorry to interrupt. We're not getting trnsltio Testing one, two, three. President Ob. For you? Cn you her, Mr. President? President Ob. Oky. Testing one, two, three. President Ob. It's just, I' sure tht he ws sying soething very wise nd iportnt, nd we wnted to ke sure tht we ll herd it. President ung. So I would like to dd tht Vietn, together with other TPP countries, hve been king efforts to nrrow differences, to proote coopertion in the spirit of utul understnding nd utul respect. And we will try to reduce differences in spirit of constructiveness nd understnding nd pying ttention to one nother's legitite interests. And the finliztion of TPP is lso the successful outcoes of ll 12 ebers of the TPP, rther thn ny individul effort. And we re prepred to rtify TPP, nd we stnd redy to ipleent ll the coitents under TPP.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nCan you comment on whether this signals a new offensive in Afghanistan?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Can you also comment on whether this signals a new offensive in Afghanistan and whether you're concerned that an even more hardline leader might take his place?For President Quang, are you concerned about the lack of enthusiasm for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the U.S. Congress and what that means for the deal in the end?

President Obama, the Trans-Pacific Partnership seems fairly stalled in Congress, and other countries are looking to follow the U.S. lead in terms of how they advance their approval of the agreement. With the deals today announced for Boeing and GE and your visit here to Vietnam, are you looking to change your strategy in how you seek approval for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in Congress? And do you think that the agreement should be amended to address currency manipulation?Secondly, President Obama, can you comment on the killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansur and on Pakistan's concern about that strike happening on its soil? Can you also comment on whether this signals a new offensive in Afghanistan and whether you're concerned that an even more hardline leader might take his place?For President Quang, are you concerned about the lack of enthusiasm for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the U.S. Congress and what that means for the deal in the end? And how do you respond to China's criticism of the U.S. pursuing what China says is a one-sided, selfish agenda in Asia that risks regional peace?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nSo, first of ll, on TPP, Angel, I hven't been round s long s Sentors Crper or Secretry Kerry, but I've spent enough tie in the Sente to know tht every trde del is pinful, becuse folks re lwys seeing if they cn get n even better del. And especilly when you hve ultiple prties involved, folks re going to be scrutinizing it, they're going to be debting it, nd in n election yer, you cn nticipte tht soe folks re going to try to score politicl points off it.Hving sid tht, I rein confident we're going to get it done. And the reson I' confident is becuse it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country. It's good for Aeric. It's good for the regio It's good for the world.And I know I've sold this to you before, but let e reiterte: This is the fstest growing prt of the world. This represents n enorous rket for the United Sttes. Most countries here lredy sell their stuff to the United Sttes, nd we hve reltively low triffs. In other words, we put reltively low txes on goods tht re coing into the United Sttes. In contrst, triffs re significntly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So del tht gets rid of 18,000 txes on U.S. goods into the lrgest, fstest growing rkets of the world, tht's good del for Aericn businesses nd Aericn workers.Nuber two, one of the biggest coplints bout trde dels historiclly hs been tht it opens up our rkets to countries with lower wges, hrsher lbor prctices, less environentl regultio Well, if you're signing up for the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, you re king coitents tht re enforceble to rise lbor stndrds, to ensure tht workers hve voice, to ttend to environentl probles. And so this gives us the bility to engge with country like Vietn nd work with the on ll those fronts, the precise things tht people, in the pst, hve been concerned bout when it coes to trding with other countries.So I hve not yet seen credible rguent tht once we get TPP in plce we're going to be worse off. We re deonstrbly better off. Aericn workers nd Aericn businesses re better off if we get this del pssed. And I' confident we will get it pssed.Now, the politics of it will be noisy. Tht ws true when I, for exple, inherited the Koren free trde greeent or the Colobin nd Pnnin free trde greeents when I ce into office. But we got the done. And I' confident tht we'll get the done this tie, s well, lthough it will\u2014there will be ups nd downs nd bups long the wy.With respect to currency nipultion, we hve provisions in TPP tht dvnce the trnsprency nd reporting functions tht llow us to onitor whether we think tht currency nipultion is tking plce. One of the debtes tht took plce\u2014nd there hve been soe who rgue tht we should hve enforceble provisions tht if you see currency going down too fr tht we should be ble to ipose triffs on tht country. The proble is, is tht it's very hrd to sort out soeties why currency is going down nd whether it's ctully being nipulted. And frnkly, for us to bind other countries to coitents bout their onetry policy would en we were lso binding our Federl Reserve to the clis of other countries in ters of how it ipleents our onetry policy, nd tht's not soething tht we would do. We would not give up sovereignty with respect to our onetry policy in tht wy.

President Obama, the Trans-Pacific Partnership seems fairly stalled in Congress, and other countries are looking to follow the U.S. lead in terms of how they advance their approval of the agreement. With the deals today announced for Boeing and GE and your visit here to Vietnam, are you looking to change your strategy in how you seek approval for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in Congress? And do you think that the agreement should be amended to address currency manipulation?Secondly, President Obama, can you comment on the killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansur and on Pakistan's concern about that strike happening on its soil? Can you also comment on whether this signals a new offensive in Afghanistan and whether you're concerned that an even more hardline leader might take his place?For President Quang, are you concerned about the lack of enthusiasm for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the U.S. Congress and what that means for the deal in the end? And how do you respond to China's criticism of the U.S. pursuing what China says is a one-sided, selfish agenda in Asia that risks regional peace?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nSo, first of ll, on TPP, Angel, I hven't been round s long s Sentors Crper or Secretry Kerry, but I've spent enough tie in the Sente to know tht every trde del is pinful, becuse folks re lwys seeing if they cn get n even better del. And especilly when you hve ultiple prties involved, folks re going to be scrutinizing it, they're going to be debting it, nd in n election yer, you cn nticipte tht soe folks re going to try to score politicl points off it.Hving sid tht, I rein confident we're going to get it done. And the reson I' confident is becuse it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country. It's good for Aeric. It's good for the regio It's good for the world.And I know I've sold this to you before, but let e reiterte: This is the fstest growing prt of the world. This represents n enorous rket for the United Sttes. Most countries here lredy sell their stuff to the United Sttes, nd we hve reltively low triffs. In other words, we put reltively low txes on goods tht re coing into the United Sttes. In contrst, triffs re significntly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So del tht gets rid of 18,000 txes on U.S. goods into the lrgest, fstest growing rkets of the world, tht's good del for Aericn businesses nd Aericn workers.Nuber two, one of the biggest coplints bout trde dels historiclly hs been tht it opens up our rkets to countries with lower wges, hrsher lbor prctices, less environentl regultio Well, if you're signing up for the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, you re king coitents tht re enforceble to rise lbor stndrds, to ensure tht workers hve voice, to ttend to environentl probles. And so this gives us the bility to engge with country like Vietn nd work with the on ll those fronts, the precise things tht people, in the pst, hve been concerned bout when it coes to trding with other countries.So I hve not yet seen credible rguent tht once we get TPP in plce we're going to be worse off. We re deonstrbly better off. Aericn workers nd Aericn businesses re better off if we get this del pssed. And I' confident we will get it pssed.Now, the politics of it will be noisy. Tht ws true when I, for exple, inherited the Koren free trde greeent or the Colobin nd Pnnin free trde greeents when I ce into office. But we got the done. And I' confident tht we'll get the done this tie, s well, lthough it will\u2014there will be ups nd downs nd bups long the wy.With respect to currency nipultion, we hve provisions in TPP tht dvnce the trnsprency nd reporting functions tht llow us to onitor whether we think tht currency nipultion is tking plce. One of the debtes tht took plce\u2014nd there hve been soe who rgue tht we should hve enforceble provisions tht if you see currency going down too fr tht we should be ble to ipose triffs on tht country. The proble is, is tht it's very hrd to sort out soeties why currency is going down nd whether it's ctully being nipulted. And frnkly, for us to bind other countries to coitents bout their onetry policy would en we were lso binding our Federl Reserve to the clis of other countries in ters of how it ipleents our onetry policy, nd tht's not soething tht we would do. We would not give up sovereignty with respect to our onetry policy in tht wy. But we hve strengthened nuber of the provisions tht re lredy contined in TPP tht will llow us to put on notice folks who we think re engging in copetitive devlutions.Finlly, on the Tlibn leder, Mr. Mnsur, it hs been confired tht he is ded. And he is n individul who, s hed of the Tlibn, ws specificlly trgeting U.S. personnel nd troops inside of Afghnistn who were there s prt of the ission tht I've set to be ble to intin counterterroris pltfor nd provide ssistnce nd trining to the Afghn ilitry forces there. So this does not represent shift in our pproch. We re not reentering the dy-to-dy cobt opertions tht re currently being conducted by Afghn security forces. Our job is to help Afghnistn secure its own country, not to hve our en nd woen in unifor engge in tht fight for the.On the other hnd, where we hve high-profile leder who hs been consistently prt of opertions nd plns to potentilly hr U.S. personnel nd who hs been resistnt to the kinds of pece tlks nd reconcilition tht ultitely could bring n end to decdes of wr in Afghnistn, then it is y responsibility s Conder in Chief not to stnd by, but to ke sure tht we send cler signl to the Tlibn nd others tht we're going to protect our people. And tht's exctly the essge tht hs been sent. President ung. Let e respond to this question concerning the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, TPP. In our view, TPP is significnt trde nd econoic linkge, contributing to sustining the dynis nd the role s driver for econoic growth in our country, s well s in the Asi-Pcific regio And for Vietn, TPP nd Vietn's prticiption in TPP is one step undertken by the Vietnese Governent in our process of extensive interntionl integrtio President Ob. Mr. President, sorry to interrupt. We're not getting trnsltio Testing one, two, three. President Ob. For you? Cn you her, Mr. President? President Ob. Oky. Testing one, two, three. President Ob. It's just, I' sure tht he ws sying soething very wise nd iportnt, nd we wnted to ke sure tht we ll herd it. President ung. So I would like to dd tht Vietn, together with other TPP countries, hve been king efforts to nrrow differences, to proote coopertion in the spirit of utul understnding nd utul respect. And we will try to reduce differences in spirit of constructiveness nd understnding nd pying ttention to one nother's legitite interests. And the finliztion of TPP is lso the successful outcoes of ll 12 ebers of the TPP, rther thn ny individul effort.

And how do you respond to China's criticism of the U.S. pursuing what China says is a one-sided, selfish agenda in Asia that risks regional peace?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nSo, first of ll, on TPP, Angel, I hven't been round s long s Sentors Crper or Secretry Kerry, but I've spent enough tie in the Sente to know tht every trde del is pinful, becuse folks re lwys seeing if they cn get n even better del. And especilly when you hve ultiple prties involved, folks re going to be scrutinizing it, they're going to be debting it, nd in n election yer, you cn nticipte tht soe folks re going to try to score politicl points off it.Hving sid tht, I rein confident we're going to get it done. And the reson I' confident is becuse it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country. It's good for Aeric. It's good for the regio It's good for the world.And I know I've sold this to you before, but let e reiterte: This is the fstest growing prt of the world. This represents n enorous rket for the United Sttes. Most countries here lredy sell their stuff to the United Sttes, nd we hve reltively low triffs. In other words, we put reltively low txes on goods tht re coing into the United Sttes. In contrst, triffs re significntly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So del tht gets rid of 18,000 txes on U.S. goods into the lrgest, fstest growing rkets of the world, tht's good del for Aericn businesses nd Aericn workers.Nuber two, one of the biggest coplints bout trde dels historiclly hs been tht it opens up our rkets to countries with lower wges, hrsher lbor prctices, less environentl regultio Well, if you're signing up for the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, you re king coitents tht re enforceble to rise lbor stndrds, to ensure tht workers hve voice, to ttend to environentl probles. And so this gives us the bility to engge with country like Vietn nd work with the on ll those fronts, the precise things tht people, in the pst, hve been concerned bout when it coes to trding with other countries.So I hve not yet seen credible rguent tht once we get TPP in plce we're going to be worse off. We re deonstrbly better off. Aericn workers nd Aericn businesses re better off if we get this del pssed. And I' confident we will get it pssed.Now, the politics of it will be noisy. Tht ws true when I, for exple, inherited the Koren free trde greeent or the Colobin nd Pnnin free trde greeents when I ce into office. But we got the done. And I' confident tht we'll get the done this tie, s well, lthough it will\u2014there will be ups nd downs nd bups long the wy.With respect to currency nipultion, we hve provisions in TPP tht dvnce the trnsprency nd reporting functions tht llow us to onitor whether we think tht currency nipultion is tking plce. One of the debtes tht took plce\u2014nd there hve been soe who rgue tht we should hve enforceble provisions tht if you see currency going down too fr tht we should be ble to ipose triffs on tht country. The proble is, is tht it's very hrd to sort out soeties why currency is going down nd whether it's ctully being nipulted. And frnkly, for us to bind other countries to coitents bout their onetry policy would en we were lso binding our Federl Reserve to the clis of other countries in ters of how it ipleents our onetry policy, nd tht's not soething tht we would do. We would not give up sovereignty with respect to our onetry policy in tht wy. But we hve strengthened nuber of the provisions tht re lredy contined in TPP tht will llow us to put on notice folks who we think re engging in copetitive devlutions.Finlly, on the Tlibn leder, Mr. Mnsur, it hs been confired tht he is ded. And he is n individul who, s hed of the Tlibn, ws specificlly trgeting U.S. personnel nd troops inside of Afghnistn who were there s prt of the ission tht I've set to be ble to intin counterterroris pltfor nd provide ssistnce nd trining to the Afghn ilitry forces there. So this does not represent shift in our pproch. We re not reentering the dy-to-dy cobt opertions tht re currently being conducted by Afghn security forces. Our job is to help Afghnistn secure its own country, not to hve our en nd woen in unifor engge in tht fight for the.On the other hnd, where we hve high-profile leder who hs been consistently prt of opertions nd plns to potentilly hr U.S. personnel nd who hs been resistnt to the kinds of pece tlks nd reconcilition tht ultitely could bring n end to decdes of wr in Afghnistn, then it is y responsibility s Conder in Chief not to stnd by, but to ke sure tht we send cler signl to the Tlibn nd others tht we're going to protect our people. And tht's exctly the essge tht hs been sent. President ung. Let e respond to this question concerning the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, TPP. In our view, TPP is significnt trde nd econoic linkge, contributing to sustining the dynis nd the role s driver for econoic growth in our country, s well s in the Asi-Pcific regio And for Vietn, TPP nd Vietn's prticiption in TPP is one step undertken by the Vietnese Governent in our process of extensive interntionl integrtio President Ob. Mr. President, sorry to interrupt. We're not getting trnsltio Testing one, two, three. President Ob. For you? Cn you her, Mr. President? President Ob. Oky. Testing one, two, three. President Ob. It's just, I' sure tht he ws sying soething very wise nd iportnt, nd we wnted to ke sure tht we ll herd it. President ung. So I would like to dd tht Vietn, together with other TPP countries, hve been king efforts to nrrow differences, to proote coopertion in the spirit of utul understnding nd utul respect. And we will try to reduce differences in spirit of constructiveness nd understnding nd pying ttention to one nother's legitite interests.

Thank you very much, Prime Minister. Chris Ship from ITV News.Mr. President, you, yourself, acknowledge the controversial timing of your comments on the EU referendum and the spirited debate that we're having here. And I think you're right. In the weeks before your arrival here, Leave campaigners have said that you're acting hypocritically. America would not accept the loss of sovereignty that we have to accept as part of the EU. America would not accept the levels of immigration from Mexico that we have to accept from the EU. And therefore, in various degrees of politeness, they have said to you that you should really keep your views to yourself. [Laughter] With that in mind, Mr. President, do you still think it was the right decision to intervene in this debate? And can I ask you this: Crucially, what happens if the U.K. does decide in June to leave the European Union?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, let me repeat: This is a decision for the people of the United Kingdom to make. I'm not coming here to fix any votes. I'm not casting a vote myself. I'm offering my opinion. And in democracies, you\u2014everybody should want more information, not less. And you shouldn't be afraid to hear an argument being made. That's not a threat. That should enhance the debate.Particularly, because my understanding is that some of the folks on the other side have been ascribing to the United States certain actions we'll take if the U.K. does leave the EU. So they say, for example, that, well, we'll just cut our own trade deals with the United States. So they're voicing an opinion about what the United States is going to do. I figured you might want to hear it from the President of the United States what I think the United States is going to do. []And on that matter, for example, I think it's fair to say that maybe some point down the line, there might be a U.K.-U.S. trade agreement, but it's not going to happen anytime soon, because our focus is in negotiating with a big bloc, the European Union, to get a trade agreement done, and the U.K. is going to be in the back of the queue, not because we don't have a special relationship, but because, given the heavy lift on any trade agreement, us having access to a big market with a lot of countries, rather than trying to do piecemeal trade agreements, is hugely inefficient.Now, to the subject at hand, obviously, the United States is in a different hemisphere, different circumstances, has different sets of relationships with its neighbors than the U.K. does. But I can tell you this. If right now I've got access to a massive market where I sell 44 percent of my exports, and now I'm thinking about leaving the organization that gives me access to that market and that is responsible for millions of jobs in my country and responsible for an enormous amount of commerce and upon which a lot of businesses depend, that's not something I'd probably do.And what I'm trying to describe is a broader principle, which is, in our own ways\u2014I mean, we don't have a common market in the Americas\u2014but in all sorts of ways, the United States constrains itself in order to bind everyone under a common set of norms and rules that makes everybody more prosperous.That's what we built after World War II. The United States and the U.K. designed a set of institutions, whether it was the United Nations or the Bretton Woods structure, IMF, World Bank, NATO, across the board. Now, that, to some degree, constrained our freedom to operate. It meant that occasionally we had to deal with some bureaucracy. It meant that on occasion we have to persuade other countries and we don't get a hundred percent of what we want in each case. But we knew that by doing so, everybody was going to be better off, partly because the norms and rules that were put in place were reflective of what we believe. If there were more free markets around the world and an orderly financial system, we knew we could operate in that environment. If we had collective defense treaties through NATO, we understood that we could formalize an architecture that would deter aggression, rather than us having, piecemeal, to put together alliances to defeat aggression after it already started. And that principle is what's at stake here. And the last point I'll make on this\u2014until I get the next question, I suspect\u2014[]\u2014is that, as David said, this magnifies the power of the U.K. It doesn't diminish it. On just about every issue, what happens in Europe is going to have an impact here. And what happens in Europe is going to have an impact in the United States.We just discussed, for example, the refugee and the migration crisis. And I've told my team\u2014which is sitting right here, so they'll vouch for me\u2014[]\u2014that we consider it a major national security issue that you have uncontrolled migration into Europe, not because these folks are coming to the United States, but because if it destabilizes Europe, our largest trading bloc\u2014trading partner, it's going to be bad for our economy. If you start seeing divisions in Europe, that weakens NATO. That will have an impact on our collective security.Now, if in fact I want somebody who's smart and common sense and tough and is thinking, as I do, in the conversations about how migration is going to be handled, somebody who also has a sense of compassion and recognizes that immigration can enhance, when done properly, the assets of a country, and not just diminish them, well, I want David Cameron in the conversation. Just as I want him in the conversation when we're having conversations\u2014discussions about information sharing and counterterrorism activity. There\u2014precisely because I have confidence in the U.K., and I know that if we're not working effectively with Paris or Brussels, then those attacks are going to migrate to the United States and to London, I want one of my strongest partners in that conversation. So it enhances the special relationship. It doesn't diminish it.. Let me just make, Chris, one point in response to that. I mean, this is our choice, nobody else's; the sovereign choice of the British people. But as we make that choice, it surely makes sense to listen to what our friends think, to listen to their opinion, to listen to their views. And that's what Barack has been talking about today.But it's also worth remembering as we make this choice, it's a British choice about the British membership of the European Union. We're not being asked to make a choice about whether we support the German style of membership or the Italian style of membership. Britain has a special status in the European Union. We're in the single market; we're not part of the single currency. We're able to travel and live and work in other European countries, but we've maintained our borders, because we're not in the Schengen no-border zone.And on this vital issue of trade, where Barack has made such a clear statement, we should remember why we are currently negotiating this biggest trade deal in the whole world and in the whole world's history, between the European Union and the United States. It's because Britain played an absolutely leading part in pushing for those talks to get going. Indeed, we announced them at the G-8 in Northern Ireland, when Britain was in the chair of that organization. We set the agenda for what could be an absolutely game-changing trade deal for jobs, for investment, because we were part of this organization.So I just want to add those important points.I think we have a U.S. question now. .

Thank you very much, Prime Minister. Chris Ship from ITV News.Mr. President, you, yourself, acknowledge the controversial timing of your comments on the EU referendum and the spirited debate that we're having here. And I think you're right. In the weeks before your arrival here, Leave campaigners have said that you're acting hypocritically. America would not accept the loss of sovereignty that we have to accept as part of the EU. America would not accept the levels of immigration from Mexico that we have to accept from the EU. And therefore, in various degrees of politeness, they have said to you that you should really keep your views to yourself. [Laughter] With that in mind, Mr. President, do you still think it was the right decision to intervene in this debate? And can I ask you this: Crucially, what happens if the U.K. does decide in June to leave the European Union?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, let me repeat: This is a decision for the people of the United Kingdom to make. I'm not coming here to fix any votes. I'm not casting a vote myself. I'm offering my opinion. And in democracies, you\u2014everybody should want more information, not less. And you shouldn't be afraid to hear an argument being made. That's not a threat. That should enhance the debate.Particularly, because my understanding is that some of the folks on the other side have been ascribing to the United States certain actions we'll take if the U.K. does leave the EU. So they say, for example, that, well, we'll just cut our own trade deals with the United States. So they're voicing an opinion about what the United States is going to do. I figured you might want to hear it from the President of the United States what I think the United States is going to do. []And on that matter, for example, I think it's fair to say that maybe some point down the line, there might be a U.K.-U.S. trade agreement, but it's not going to happen anytime soon, because our focus is in negotiating with a big bloc, the European Union, to get a trade agreement done, and the U.K. is going to be in the back of the queue, not because we don't have a special relationship, but because, given the heavy lift on any trade agreement, us having access to a big market with a lot of countries, rather than trying to do piecemeal trade agreements, is hugely inefficient.Now, to the subject at hand, obviously, the United States is in a different hemisphere, different circumstances, has different sets of relationships with its neighbors than the U.K. does. But I can tell you this. If right now I've got access to a massive market where I sell 44 percent of my exports, and now I'm thinking about leaving the organization that gives me access to that market and that is responsible for millions of jobs in my country and responsible for an enormous amount of commerce and upon which a lot of businesses depend, that's not something I'd probably do.And what I'm trying to describe is a broader principle, which is, in our own ways\u2014I mean, we don't have a common market in the Americas\u2014but in all sorts of ways, the United States constrains itself in order to bind everyone under a common set of norms and rules that makes everybody more prosperous.That's what we built after World War II. The United States and the U.K. designed a set of institutions, whether it was the United Nations or the Bretton Woods structure, IMF, World Bank, NATO, across the board. Now, that, to some degree, constrained our freedom to operate. It meant that occasionally we had to deal with some bureaucracy. It meant that on occasion we have to persuade other countries and we don't get a hundred percent of what we want in each case. But we knew that by doing so, everybody was going to be better off, partly because the norms and rules that were put in place were reflective of what we believe. If there were more free markets around the world and an orderly financial system, we knew we could operate in that environment. If we had collective defense treaties through NATO, we understood that we could formalize an architecture that would deter aggression, rather than us having, piecemeal, to put together alliances to defeat aggression after it already started. And that principle is what's at stake here. And the last point I'll make on this\u2014until I get the next question, I suspect\u2014[]\u2014is that, as David said, this magnifies the power of the U.K. It doesn't diminish it. On just about every issue, what happens in Europe is going to have an impact here. And what happens in Europe is going to have an impact in the United States.We just discussed, for example, the refugee and the migration crisis.

Well, indulge all of us back in the U.S., sir. Prince passed away. You were a fan. You had invited him to perform at the White House. Can you tell us what made you a fan?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI'm trying to figure out which order to do this. [] Maybe I'll start with North Carolina and Mississippi. I want everybody here in the United Kingdom to know that the people of North Carolina and Mississippi are wonderful people. They are hospitable people. They are beautiful States, and you are welcome and you should come and enjoy yourselves. And I think you'll be treated with extraordinary hospitality.I also think that the laws that have been passed there are wrong and should be overturned. And they're in response to politics, in part; in part, some strong emotions that are generated by people, some of whom are good people, but I just disagree with when it comes to respecting the equal rights of all people, regardless of sexual orientation, whether they're transgender or gay or lesbian. And although I respect their different viewpoints, I think it's very important for us not to send signals that anybody is treated differently.And I think it's fair to say that we're not unique among countries where\u2014particularly under a federal system in which power is dispersed, that there are going to be some localities or local officials that put forward laws that aren't necessarily reflective of a national consensus. But if you guys come to North Carolina or Mississippi, everybody will be treated well.The second question with respect to Syria, I am deeply concerned about the cessation of hostilities fraying and whether it's sustainable. Now, keep in mind that I have always been skeptical about Mr. Putin's actions and motives inside of Syria. He is\u2014along with Iran\u2014the preeminent backer of a murderous regime that I do not believe can regain legitimacy within his country because he's murdered a lot of people.Having said that, what I also believe is, is that we cannot end the crisis in Syria without political negotiations and without getting all the parties around the table to craft a transition plan. And that, by necessity, means that there are going to be some people on one side of the table who I deeply disagree with and whose actions I deeply abhor. That's how oftentimes you resolve conflicts like this that are taking an enormous toll on the Syrian people.The cessation of hostilities actually held longer than I expected. And for 7 weeks, we've seen a significant reduction in violence inside that country. And that gave some relief to people.I talked to Putin on Monday precisely to reinforce to him the importance of us trying to maintain the cessation of hostilities, asking him to put more pressure on Asad, indicating to him that we would continue to try to get the moderate opposition to stay at the negotiating table in Geneva. But this has always been hard. And it's going to keep being hard. And what David and I discussed in our meeting was that we will continue to prosecute the war against Daesh, against ISIL. We are going to continue to support those who are prepared to fight ISIL. And we're going to continue to target them. We're going to continue to make progress. But we're not going to solve the overall problem unless we can get this political track moving.I assure you that we have looked at all options. None of them are great. And so we are going to play this option out. If in fact the cessation falls apart, we'll try to put it back together again even as we continue to go after ISIL. And it is in my belief\u2014it's my belief that ultimately Russia will recognize that, just as this can't be solved by a military victory on the part of those we support, Russia may be able to keep the lid on, alongside Iran, for a while, but if you don't have a legitimate Government there, they will be bled as well. And that is not\u2014that's not speculation on my part. I think the evidence all points in that direction.And finally, with respect to Prince, I loved Prince because he put out great music and he was a great performer. I didn't know him well. He came to perform at the White House last year and was extraordinary and creative and original and full of energy. And so it's a remarkable loss.And I'm staying at Winfield House, the U.S. Ambassador's residence. It so happens our Ambassador has a turntable, and so this morning we played Purple Rain and Delirious just to get warmed up\u2014[]\u2014before we left the house for important bilateral meetings like this. []. As a fan of great music, the Ambassador has brought a lot of brilliant talent. . Absolutely.. Let me just answer: I've been to North Carolina many years ago and enjoyed it. I have not yet made it to Mississippi, but one day I hope to. The guidance that we put out, the Foreign Office, gives advice on travel, and it obviously deals with laws in situations as they are, and it tries to give that advice dispassionately, impartially. But it's very important that it does so. And it's something that a lot of attention is given to.Our view on any of these things is that we believe that we should be trying to use law to end discrimination rather than to embed it or enhance it. And that's something we're comfortable saying to countries and friends anywhere in the world. But obviously, the laws people pass is a matter for their own legislatures. But we make clear our own views about the importance of trying to end discrimination, and we've made some important steps forward in our own country on that front, which we're proud of.With that\u2014\u2014 . All good?. Thank you very much. . Thank you very much, everybody.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\n.

I want to ask about Iran. And 3 weeks ago, Iran's Supreme Leader complained that his country has not been getting actual business deals since the nuclear agreement. And non-U.S. companies are saying that it's very hard, or sometimes impossible, to do much business with Iran without at some point accessing the U.S. financial system to do U.S. dollar-denominated transactions. So my question is, are you considering allowing such transactions? And if so, is that not a betrayal of your assurances that most U.S. sanctions would stay in place?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThat's not actually the approach that we're taking. So let me say broadly that so long as is carrying out its end of the bargain, we think it's important for the world community to carry out our end of the bargain.They have, in fact, based on the presentations that were made by the IAEA this morning to the P-5-plus-1, have, in fact, followed the implementation steps that were laid out. And as a consequence, sanctions related to their nuclear program have been brought down. Part of the challenge that they face is that companies haven't been doing business there for a long time and they need to get comfortable with the prospects of this deal holding.One of the things that Secretary Lew and his counterparts within the P-5-plus-1 and elsewhere are going to be doing is providing clarity to businesses about what transactions are, in fact, allowed. And it's going to take time over the next several months for companies and their legal departments to feel confident that, in fact, there may not be risks of liability if they do business with .And so some of the concerns that has expressed we are going to work with them to address. It is not necessary that we take the approach of them going through dollar-denominated transactions. It is possible for them to work through European financial institutions as well. But there is going to need to be continued clarification provided to businesses in order to\u2014for deal flows to begin.Now, what I would say is also important is 's own behavior in generating confidence that is a safe place to do business. In a deal like this, my first priority, my first concern was making sure that we got their nuclear program stopped, and material that they already had that would give them a very short breakout capacity, that that was shipped out. That has happened. And I always said that I could not promise that would take advantage of this opportunity and this window to reenter the international community., so far, has followed the letter of the agreement. But the spirit of the agreement involves also sending signals to the world community and businesses that it is not going to be engaging in a range of provocative actions that might scare business off. When they launched ballistic missiles with slogans calling for the destruction of Israel, that makes businesses nervous. There is some geopolitical risk that is heightened when they see that taking place. If you see\u2014if continues to ship missiles to Hizballah, that gets businesses nervous. And so part of what I hope happens is we have a responsibility to provide clarity about the rules that govern so that can, in fact, benefit, the ian people can benefit from an improved economic situation. But has to understand what every country in the world understands, which is, businesses want to go where they feel safe, where they don't see massive controversy, where they can be confident that transactions are going to operate normally. And that's an adjustment that is going to have to make as well.And frankly, within , I suspect there are different views. In the same way that there are hardliners here in the United States who, even after we certify that this deal is working, even after our intelligence teams, Israeli intelligence teams, say this has been a game changer, are still opposed to the deal on principle, there are hardliners inside of who don't want to see open itself up to the broader world community and are doing things to potentially undermine the deal.And so those forces that seek the benefits of the deal not just in narrow terms, but more broadly, we want to make sure that, over time, they're in a position to realize those benefits.

Mr. President, you're going to California today. And as you said earlier this week, you told the Nation that there's no specific or credible threat of a similar attack. But how is it really possible to know? I mean, aren't similar plots going to be just as hard to detect beforehand? And some lawmakers are saying that your Government should review the social media of all people applying for visas to come to this country. What do you think of that idea? Should that be mandatory?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, Roberta, you're absolutely right that it is very difficult for us to detect lone-wolf plotsor plots involving a husband and wife, in this casebecause despite the incredible vigilance thatand professionalism of all our law enforcement, homeland security, et cetera, it's not that different from us trying to detect the next mass shooter. You don't always see it. They're not always communicating publicly, and if you're not catching what they say publicly, then it becomes a challenge.We are continuing to work at every level to make sure that there's no slip between information sharing among agencies. We're continuing to strengthen our information sharing with foreign countries. And because, in part, of the tragedy in Paris, I think you're seeing much greater cooperation from our European partners on these issues.But this is a different kind of challenge than the sort that we had with an organization like Al aida that involved highly trained operatives who are working as cells or as a network. Here, essentially, you have ISIL trying to encourage or induce somebody who may be prey to this kind of propaganda. And it becomes more difficult to see. It does mean that they're less likely to be able to carry out large, complex attacks.

And one of the things we'll be doing is engaging with the high-tech community to find out how we can, in an appropriate way, do a better job, if we have a lead, to be able to track a suspected terrorist. But we're going to have to recognize that no government is going to have the capacity to read every single person's text or e-mails or social media. If it's not posted publicly, then there are going to be feasibility issues that are probably insurmountable at some level, and it raises questions about our values.I mean, keep in mind it was only a couple of years ago where we were having a major debate about whether the Government was becoming too much like Big Brother.

Ihe has lost legitimacy in the eyes of a large majority of the country.Now, is there a way of us constructing a bridge creating a political transition that allows those who are allied with Asad right nowallows the Russians, allows the Iraniansto ensure that their equities are respected, that minorities like the Alawites are not crushed or retribution is not the order of the day? I think that's going to be very important as well.And that's what makes this so difficult. Sadly, had Asad made a decision earlier that he was not more important personally than his entire country, that kind of political transition would have been much easier. It's a lot harder now. But John Kerry has been doing some excellent work in moving that process forward. And I do think that you've seen from the Russians a recognition that, after a couple of months, they're not really moving the needle that much indespite a sizeable deployment inside of Syria. And of course, that's what I suggested would happen, because there's only so much bombing you can do when an entire country is outraged and believes that its ruler doesn't represent them.Cheryl Bolen [Bloomberg BNA].Federal Budget/Former Speaker of the House of Representatives John A.

You mentioned American leadership. Is it embarrassing to you that the other party denies climate change\u2014[inaudible]\u2014the world?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNo, it'sbecause, first of all, I'm not a member of that party. [] Second of all, it didn't stop us from being the key leader in getting this done.I mean, this is something I've been working on now for 5, 6 years. When I went to Copenhagen, I essentially engaged in 24 hours of diplomacy to salvage from a pretty chaotic process the basic principle that all countries had to participate, that itwe couldn't have a rigid division between developed countries and developing countries when it came to solving this problem. That was the initial foundation for us then working with other countries, culminating in the joint announcement with China, bringing in India, bringing in Brazil and the other big, emerging countries, working with the Europeans, and getting this done.This would not have happened without American leadership. And by the way, the same is true for the Iran nuclear deal. The same is true for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The same is true for stamping out Ebola, something, you guys may recall from last year, which was the potential end of the world.At each juncture, what we've said is, is that American strength and American exceptionalism is not just a matter of us bombing somebody. More often, it's a matter of us convening, setting the agenda, pointing other nations in a direction that's good for everybody and good for U.S. interests, engaging in painstaking diplomacy, leading by example. And sometimes, the results don't come overnight, they don't come the following day, but they come.And this year, what you really saw was that steady, persistent leadership on aon many initiatives that I began when I first came into office.All right.

Thank you, Mr. President. Do you believe that Turkey is doing enough to strengthen its northwest border with Syria? How is it that a NATO country with as large a military as Turkey has has not sealed this border? And is that something that you raised today with President Erdogan?And then, to put a finer point on the climate change question, can leaders gathered here believe that the United States will keep its commitments, even after you've left office, if a Republican succeeds you in the White House?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nJust with respect to my successor, let me, first of all, say that I'm anticipating a Democrat succeeding me. [] I'm confident in the wisdom of the American people on that front.But even if somebody from a different party succeeded me, one of the things that you find is when you're in this job, you think about it differently than when you're just running for the job. And what you realize is what I mentioned earlier, that American leadership involves not just playing to a narrow constituency back home, but you now are, in fact, at the center of what happens around the world and that your credibility and America's ability to influence events depends on taking seriously what other countries care about.Now, the fact of the matter is, there's a reason why you have the largest gathering of world leaders probably in human history here in Paris. Everybody else is taking climate change really seriously. They think it's a really big problem. It spans political parties. I mean, you travel around Europe, and you talk to leaders of governments and the opposition, and they are arguing about a whole bunch of things; one thing they're not arguing about is whether the science of climate change is real and whether or not we have to do something about it.So whoever is the President\u2014next President of the United States, if they come in and they suggest somehow that that global consensus\u2014not just 99.5 percent of scientists and experts, but 99 percent of world leaders\u2014think this is really important, I think the President of the United States is going to need to think this is really important. And that's why it's important for us to not project what's being said on a campaign trail, but to do what's right and make the case.And I would note that the American people, I think in the most recent survey, two-thirds of them said America should be a signatory to any agreement that emerges that is actually addressing climate change in a serious way. So the good news is, the politics inside the United States is changing as well. Sometimes, it may be hard for Republicans to support something that I'm doing, but that's more a matter of the games Washington plays. And that's why I think people should be confident that we'll meet our commitments on this.With respect to Turkey, I have had repeated conversations with President Erdogan about the need to close the border between Turkey and Syria. We've seen some serious progress on that front, but there are still some gaps. In particular, there's about 98 kilometers that are still used as a transit point for foreign fighters, ISIL shipping out fuel for sale that helps finance their terrorist activities.And so we have been having our militaries work together to determine how a combination of air and Turkish ground forces on the Turkish side of the border can do a much better job of sealing the border than currently is. And I think President Erdogan recognizes that. I'm also encouraged by the fact that President Erdogan and the EU had a series of meetings around\u2014or Turkey and the EU had a series of meetings around the issue of the Turkish-Greek border. We have to remind ourselves, Turkey has taken on an enormous humanitarian effort. There are millions of Syrians who are displaced and living inside of Turkey. Not just refugee camps, but they are now moving into major cities throughout Turkey. That puts enormous strains on their infrastructure, on their housing, on employment.

[] I'm confident in the wisdom of the American people on that front.But even if somebody from a different party succeeded me, one of the things that you find is when you're in this job, you think about it differently than when you're just running for the job. And what you realize is what I mentioned earlier, that American leadership involves not just playing to a narrow constituency back home, but you now are, in fact, at the center of what happens around the world and that your credibility and America's ability to influence events depends on taking seriously what other countries care about.Now, the fact of the matter is, there's a reason why you have the largest gathering of world leaders probably in human history here in Paris. Everybody else is taking climate change really seriously. They think it's a really big problem. It spans political parties. I mean, you travel around Europe, and you talk to leaders of governments and the opposition, and they are arguing about a whole bunch of things; one thing they're not arguing about is whether the science of climate change is real and whether or not we have to do something about it.So whoever is the President\u2014next President of the United States, if they come in and they suggest somehow that that global consensus\u2014not just 99.5 percent of scientists and experts, but 99 percent of world leaders\u2014think this is really important, I think the President of the United States is going to need to think this is really important. And that's why it's important for us to not project what's being said on a campaign trail, but to do what's right and make the case.And I would note that the American people, I think in the most recent survey, two-thirds of them said America should be a signatory to any agreement that emerges that is actually addressing climate change in a serious way. So the good news is, the politics inside the United States is changing as well. Sometimes, it may be hard for Republicans to support something that I'm doing, but that's more a matter of the games Washington plays. And that's why I think people should be confident that we'll meet our commitments on this.With respect to Turkey, I have had repeated conversations with President Erdogan about the need to close the border between Turkey and Syria. We've seen some serious progress on that front, but there are still some gaps. In particular, there's about 98 kilometers that are still used as a transit point for foreign fighters, ISIL shipping out fuel for sale that helps finance their terrorist activities.And so we have been having our militaries work together to determine how a combination of air and Turkish ground forces on the Turkish side of the border can do a much better job of sealing the border than currently is. And I think President Erdogan recognizes that. I'm also encouraged by the fact that President Erdogan and the EU had a series of meetings around\u2014or Turkey and the EU had a series of meetings around the issue of the Turkish-Greek border.

Did you raise the border issue with him today?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI\u2014we talked about it today, but I guess what I'm saying, Jeff, is this has been an ongoing conversation. We've recognized that this is a central part of our anti-ISIL strategy. We've got to choke them off. We have to choke off how they make money. We've got to choke off their ability to bring in new fighters. Because we've taken tens of thousands of their fighters off the battlefield, but if new ones are still coming in, then they continue to maintain a stranglehold over certain population centers inside of Iraq or Syria. So we've got to cut off their source of new fighters.That's also part of the great danger for Europe, and ultimately the United States as well, and countries as far flung as Australia or Singapore. If you've got foreign fighters coming in that are getting not only ideologically hardened, but battle hardened, and then they're returning to their home countries, they're likely candidates for engaging in the kind of terrorist attacks that we saw here in Paris.So this has been an ongoing concern, and we're going to continue to push hard among all our allies to cut off the financing, cut off the foreign fighters, improve our intelligence gathering, which has allowed us to accelerate the strikes that we're taking against ISIL.A lot of the discussion over the last couple of weeks was the pace of airstrikes. The pace of airstrikes is not constrained by the amount of planes or missiles that we have, the pace has been dictated by how many effective targets do we have. And our intelligence continues to improve. And the better we get at that, the better we're going to be at going after them.Scott Horsley [NPR].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDid you raise the border issue with him today?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

This is a question for both of you. First, what is your reaction to Turkey shooting down a Russian plane today? And does this draw NATO into a confrontation with Russia? How do you keep this from spiraling out of control?And, President Obama, what does this incident mean for future prospects of military coordination\u2014more military coordination with Russia? And, President Hollande, ahead of your trip to Moscow on Thursday, what are the prospects for closer military coordination with Russia, given what happened today?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nGood Well, first of all, we're still getting the details of what happened And I expect to be in communications, potentially directly, with President Erdogan sometime over the next several daysTurkey, like every country, has a right to defend its territory and its airspace I think it's very important right now for us to make sure that both the Russians and the Turks are talking to each other to find out exactly what happened and take measures to discourage any kind of escalationI do think that this points to a ongoing problem with the Russian operations in the sense that they are operating very close to a Turkish border and they are going after a moderate opposition that are supported by not only Turkey, but a wide range of countries And if Russia is directing its energies towards Daesh and ISIL, some of those conflicts, or potentials for mistakes or escalation, are less likely to occurI also think this underscores the importance of us making sure that we move this political track forward as quickly as possible Like President Hollande, our view from the start has been that Russia is welcome to be part of this broad-based coalition that we've set up There's never been a point in time in which we said that we don't want Russia or other countries that may have differences with us on a whole host of other things to avoid working with us against ISILThe challenge has been Russia's focus on propping up Asad rather than focusing on ISIL I had a conversation with President Putin in Turkey, and I indicated to him at the time that to the extent that they make that strategic shift\u2014focus on the Vienna process, where they have been constructive, to try to bring all the parties together; try to execute a political transition that all parties would agree to; and refocus attention on going after ISIL\u2014then there's enormous capacity for us to cooperateUntil that happens, it's very difficult It's difficult because if their priority is attacking the moderate opposition that might be future members of an inclusive Syrian Government, Russia is not going to get the support of us or a range of other members of the coalitionBut I do think that there is the possibility of cooperation The sooner we agree to this political process, the less likely that you have the kinds of events that took place, apparently, today President Hollande The event that took place is a serious one, and we can only regret it Turkey is currently providing all of the information to NATO so that we can find out what truly happened and whether Turkey's airspace indeed was entered into But we must prevent an escalation; that would be extremely damageable The only purpose is to fight against terrorism and Daesh This is what we must do, all of us: we, Turkey, RussiaAnd what just took place, like Barack said, means that we must find a solution to the Syrian crisis, because we can see what the risks are otherwise: the risks of escalation I, therefore, will be traveling to Russia this week because we have this resolution of the Security Council, and it does show that we must take action against Daesh, against terrorism That resolution has been voted unanimously In a way, that was the broadest possible coalitionThen, I will ask President Putin, as I've done before and what I told the Russians a number of times already, that the strikes must be against Daesh, against terrorism, and those who precisely are threatening us They are threatening the Russians, like ourselves in Europe, like France that was targeted over the past few days We must, therefore, coordinate ourselves, cooperate, but on that basis, and make sure that we're all acting against Daesh And that will be part of the political process, one that must lead to the solution And we all know what the parameters of the solution are or are not We know that there's a deadlock todayLastly, I mentioned the aircraft carrier, which is in the east of the Mediterranean now As a matter of fact, there are also some Russian forces And I, therefore, agreed with President Putin that we must share our intelligence so that we can act in coordination We must not contradict ourselves And it's already the case, and we'll continue to do so[]\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat does this incident mean for future prospects of military coordination with Russia?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}
