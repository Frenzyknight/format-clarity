Mob justice is not justice. Justice sought by violence is not justice\u2014it just becomes revenge.I mean, I heard that, I said, Write that down for me, please.

I think everyone now knows who he is.I will be speaking to the Governor. And we have a call scheduled to make very shortly with the Governor.

Why 46 days to the election?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nBecause what we're doing is, we've been working on it for a long time to get it passed. Very tough to get things past Democrats, where they don't want to see this happen. And they probably, certainly, didn't want to see it happen at this point.But it's a big package. It's a great package. And I think the most exciting part of the package isn't necessarily the billions of dollars; it's going to be what we do with the pharmaceutical industry. We're going to get them back into Puerto Rico. They liked being there, but they changed the tax situation; they ripped it out.

The people who are on the prioritized list of\u2014including high risk, including first responders\u2014will have the ability to take the vaccine\u2014no one is being mandated to be vaccinated\u2014at the latest, in January.And as we said yesterday and\u2014or I think yesterday\u2014there will be hundreds of millions of doses delivered for people to take it during the first quarter. And so that, by April, every single American who wants to be vaccinated will have the ability to be vaccinated. It's not a forced vaccination, of course. Q. And when did you\u2014Dr. Fauci said today\u2014basically echoed Dr. Redfield's comments that Q2, Q3\u2014at some point the summer of next year\u2014the entire country, potentially, or at least as many Americans that need to be vaccinated will be vaccinated.

Thank you, Mr. President. On Kuwait: So the Ambassador to\u2014the Kuwaiti Ambassador to Austria this week told the IAEA that the Kuwaiti Government is very concerned over Iran's constant breaching of the JCPOA. In your discussions with the Kuwaitis today, have you discussed where they stand this week as we go into the U.N., as the United States tries to extend sanctions on Iran?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, they just left my office, as you know, the Oval Office. And we had a very good meeting with the Amir, and I think we understand each other very well. They're very excited about a lot of things that are happening in the Middle East. They are so excited that we signed the first two countries, and I think they'll end up fairly quickly being a part of it.I have, I would say, seven or eight countries that want to be a part of it without even working very easily, very quickly. Nobody thought this would happen. And not only is it happening, it's happening rather easily. We discussed that very briefly, because that's an easy one. Believe it or not, that whole thing is now a beautiful puzzle that's coming together very nicely.But we are talking to them and others about various aspects of the Middle East. The Middle East is straightening out with all this happening. You know, we've brought a lot of our troops back. A lot of them are coming back in the very near future.We're out of Syria, other than we kept the oil. I kept the oil. And we have troops guarding the oil. Other than that, we're out of Syria. We took them off the border between Syria and Turkey. We had a lot of troops on the border. Ultimately, we got it down to 50, and I thought they were in great danger when you have two armies sitting there looking to fight, and you have 50 people in the middle. I don't care who you are, even if you're the U.S., those 50 people are in great danger. We took them out.But we had a lot of troops on the border, and we took them out. I said, Look, they've been fighting on their border for 200 years and a lot longer than that, under different names, and they can continue to do that. That's not for us; we're guarding our own borders. We're doing very well on our southern border, as an example.So we're out of Syria, except we kept the oil, and we'll make a determination. We'll probably be dealing with the Kurds and the oil and see what it all ends up. But we'll be out.And very importantly, we're down to very few soldiers in Iraq, and we're down\u2014we'll be down very shortly over the next couple of weeks to 4,000\u2014less than 4,000 in Afghanistan. And then we'll make that final determination a little bit later on.We're dealing very well with the Taliban. They're very tough, they're very smart, they're very sharp. But you know, it's been 19 years, and even they are tired of fighting, in all fairness. And we really served as a police force, because if we wanted to do what we had to do, we would have fought a lot differently than they have over the 19 years. They didn't fight it properly. They were police, okay? They're not police; they're soldiers. So there's a difference. The police\u2014nobody has more respect for police than I do, but they have to do their own policing.So we're having some very good discussions with the Taliban, as you probably heard. It's been public. And\u2014but we'll be down to\u2014very shortly, we'll be down to less than 4,000 soldiers. And so we'll be out of there, knowing that certain things have to happen\u2014certain things have to be fulfilled. But 19 years is a long time, 8,000 miles away. Nineteen years is a long time.And the Middle East\u2014the whole Middle East equation, if you look at what's happened, if you've looked at the stupidity of decisions that were made, including the deal that was made\u2014I mean, take a look at what happened with Iran. Had that deal stayed and had I not broken that deal, you could have never done the deal that I'm doing now where all the countries are pouring in.And I had two calls this morning with countries; they want to know, When can we go into the deal? They want to go. It's not that we're giving them anything. They want security, they want peace, and they're really tired of fighting. It's incredible. They're tired of fighting. They've been fighting for so many years. They're tired of fighting.

So you're sending something in, it's handled professionally, they send it back\u2014it's a whole thing. That's much different than unsolicited, when you get millions of ballots.

Look, the U.S.\u2014we just won a seven-and-a-half-billion-dollar lawsuit, which\u2014nobody used to sue before I came along, you know\u2014or they used to lose them every single time. Now they haven't been losing them.But we're getting reports on the WTO. It's not good. Never been good to us. The WTO, as far as I'm concerned, was created to suck money and jobs out of the United States to the benefit of and other countries\u2014that's what my opinion is\u2014whether it was created or it just turned out to be that way.But the World Trade Organization has been not good for the United States.

But, sir, are you reversing the statement? You never answered about the statement. Just\u2014I'll just let you go after this, but do you want to reverse what you told Woodward about the 13- to 14-month timeline for a vaccine?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, the vaccine\u2014at the time, I thought it might take that period of time, but we've stepped it up very substantially.And now\u2014I mean, I'm just telling you the\u2014this is just what it is. We've been able to step it up very, very rapidly. I never thought we could have a vaccine as quickly as we did, but I freed it up. I freed up the FDA. Dr. Hahn has done a great job. And they're ready to approve something when they come in.The other thing that's happening that's very different is\u2014you look at a company like Pfizer, a great company\u2014really, one of the great companies of the world. Johnson & Johnson. They're all great companies. They're doing a lot of testing at a very rapid rate that nobody has ever seen anything like it. You know, they're out in third\u2014they're in the third level of trial. And I think that you're going to see things that are amazing.When I made statements like that\u2014that's an old statement. When I made statements like that, I had no idea that we could produce as well as we're producing. But only because of what I've done with the FDA and other things can we come up with numbers like that. We're lucky that we don't have to, because that was considered fast.If this were a\u2014an administration from the past\u2014and I think I can say far beyond Obama, if\u2014it was other administrations also\u2014you wouldn't have a vaccine for 2\u00bd, 3 years. And we're going to have a vaccine within, at most, a couple of months.Okay?\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nThe question asks if the interviewee wants to reverse what they previously told Woodward about the 13- to 14-month timeline for a vaccine.\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nAmbivalent\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Then why not devote your energy now to a campaign to have all Americans wear a mask, something that if more effective than a vaccine, would also help schools and the economy?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nOkay, number one, it's not more effective, by any means, than a vaccine. And I called him about that. Those were the two things I discussed with him. And I believe that if you ask him, he would probably say that he didn't understand the question. Because I said to him\u2014I asked him those two questions: the one question which we covered and the mask question.And I was inaccurately covered, because I was on with George last night\u2014George Stephanopoulos. And I enjoyed it. I think people enjoyed it. I got\u2014you know, a lot of people said very good things about the show. I hope they did well. But they said a lot of good things about the show, but they always cut my sentences off. You know, they cut it off.On masks, the masks have problems too. And I talked about the masks about to be handled very gently, very carefully. I see that, in restaurants, they have people with masks, and they're playing around with their mask, and they have it\u2014their fingers are in their mask, and then they're serving with plates. I mean, I think there's a lot of problems with masks.No, vaccine is much more effective than the masks. And if we get the vaccine, we have\u2014added to the fact that our numbers are going way down. You know, you see the numbers. I'm just reading you statistics that are from wherever they get them. But they're very highly qualified statistics.But no, the mask is not as important as the vaccine. The mask, perhaps, helps. Don't forget: A lot of people didn't like the concept of masks initially. Dr. Fauci didn't like them, and a lot of people didn't. And I'm not knocking anybody, because I understand both sides of the argument.But when I called up Robert today, I said to him, What's with the masks? He said, I think I answered that question incorrectly. I think maybe he misunderstood it. I mean, you know, you have two questions; maybe he misunderstood both of them. But the answer to the one is, it's going to be a much faster distribution than he said. Maybe he's not aware of the distribution process. It's not really his thing as much as it would be, let's say, mine. But the distribution is going to be much faster.As far as the mask is concerned, I hope that the vaccine is going to be a lot more beneficial than the masks, because people have used the masks. But when I looked at that chart that we put up, if you look, you know, we write\u2014if you do the good job\u2014they had, I guess, 240,000. But if you do the good\u2014if it worked out well\u2014now, look, one death is too much. One death is too much; should have never happened.

Joe feels very safe in a mask. I don't know, maybe he doesn't want to expose his face. I don't know what's going on. He'll be way away from people, nowhere near people\u2014there will be nobody with him. He doesn't draw any crowds. He'll have circles. These big circles. They'll be way far away. There's no reason for him to have masks on.We get tested\u2014I'm tested; I have people tested. When people come into the Oval Office, it's like a big deal.

But can you talk us through a bit more on the focus on distributing to minorities and how that would work?And then for you, Mr. President, you mentioned the drop in the poverty rate. Specifically, we noticed at\u2014just the news that the poverty rate for African Americans hit historic lows, that the household wealth increased historically for African Americans. What was driving that increase in wealth for African Americans?And now, in 2020, with the coronavirus, with unemployment spiking, what would be your plan for the second term to improve lives for African Americans?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I'll go first, because of your question\u2014I appreciate your question. And yes, we've had a tremendous drop in poverty for all people in our Nation, but in particular for African Americans. And that statistic came in. And it's because the African American community, the Black community has had the lowest\u2014the best employment numbers that we've ever had\u2014both employment and unemployment, depending on how you want to define it.But we've had the best employment numbers we've ever had. Now, we had the greatest employment in the country ever, almost 160 million people. We've never been close to that number, but we were just 6 months ago.And yes, the\u2014I'm very proud of the numbers. African Americans, Hispanic Americans\u2014they had the best numbers they've ever had, by far\u2014both employment and unemployment, depending on definition.Thank you very much for that question. Scott, do you want to answer that too? Okay. Yes, so what I\u2014to clarify, I said that the first prioritization is the high-risk people and frontline health care workers.But just to reiterate, what I said, there are 51,000 outlets for distribution for vaccination, and there's over 14,000 Federally ualified Health Centers that are particularly targeted to minority and low-income areas. So that's a focus.And I want to point out two other things. We're also prioritizing testing at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and we're in the process of getting that finalized because we know that there's high\u2014there's a higher morbidity with\u2014in certain ethnic groups.And last thing I would say is, it's particularly heinous\u2014an egregious abuse of the media to instill fear into people about taking a vaccine, because there is no shortcut here. Everything is safe. Everything is effective. And for people who have particularly an influence on minority communities to instill fear and doubt is a particularly, you know, outrageous abuse of public policy and of leadership. These are people that have higher risk.And so I implore everyone who is in a high-risk category that when we get a safe, effective vaccine, they should take the vaccine. . I will say, this is a phenomena that only happened when they realized that we may very well have the vaccine prior to a certain very important date, namely November 3. Once they heard that, the Democrats started\u2014just to show you how bad the intention is, they started knocking the vaccine. Had nothing to do with a vaccine, it was totally made up. It's all disinformation.Just like they put an ad in about football. Just like they put\u2014with respect to me. I'm the one that got football back. And I was always against them going out. It was ridiculous that Big Ten and now, hopefully, Pac-10 [Pac-12]* goes back.And I say that, just like\u2014even worse, they put out a totally fake ad, totally made-up story. It was a made-up story by a third-rate magazine, where the head guy\u2014I guess, the head person\u2014I have no idea who he is; I don't know him, but he's friends with Obama and Clinton. So they made up this horrible story, and then they did ads. Well, they made up this story too.This story is very simple: They started knocking the vaccine as soon as they heard that this actually may come out prior to election. Now, it may or may not, but it will be within a matter of weeks. It will be within a matter of weeks from November. It's ready to go and it's ready to\u2014for massive distribution to everybody\u2014with a focus, again, on seniors.And I will say, also, the Historically Black Colleges and Universities, we are doing, at my suggestion\u2014because they have had a difficult problem there\u2014we are doing more testing there and finer testing. We have our great apparatus there.But we\u2014when you look at what we've done on testing, in terms of the technology and the amount, it's been really amazing. In fact, I think we're going to crack a hundred million tests very soon, in the very near future. We're going to be cracking a hundred million tests.Now what that does do is, it shows up more cases. If we didn't test, we wouldn't have cases. You would have no cases. Other countries, they don't test; they don't have cases. And then they say, Oh, the United States\u2014well\u2014but we're proud of it, because it shows where there may be a problem, and it helps people. But we're doing tremendous testing at the Historically Black Colleges and Universities. And that was a suggestion I made, and I think it's a good suggestion.Yes, please, go ahead.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nCan you talk us through a bit more on the focus on distributing to minorities and how that would work?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

But how\u2014the broader question is: How can the American people trust you on the pandemic when you're contradicting the head of the CDC in your own administration?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nBecause of the great job we've done. Because of the great things we've done in other fields, also. Because of the fact that we created ventilators. We built ventilators by the thousands and now we're supplying to the world.Because of all of the incredible work we've done for Governors, who are, on every call, saying: This is incredible. This is great. This is great. Sometimes, they're not quite as friendly at a news conference when you have people covering it.But we have done a phenomenal job on COVID-19, as they like to call it; I call it other things. But we have done a phenomenal job.I get calls from other people in other countries. They can't believe the job we've done. And then they'll say, Is there any way that you could get us ventilators? I say, How many do you need? One thousand ventilators. I said, We'll be able to take care of it. We're making thousands of ventilators\u2014very complex, very expensive, very difficult thing to make. We're making thousands a month. The cupboard was bare when I got here.And I will tell you, our distribution is going to be very rapid and very\u2014it's going to be all-encompassing. We are going to have a focus on certain groups that have problems\u2014senior citizens, et cetera\u2014but it's a very powerful\u2014it's a\u2014it's going to be very powerful distribution. It's going to cover everybody, and it's going to cover them rapidly.I don't know whether or not the doctor knows that, how much he covers. But I called him because I said, Why did you say that long? He wasn't that aware of it. And the other one was the mask. The vaccine is going to have tremendous power. It's going to be extremely strong. It's going to be extremely successful. We're not going to have a problem.And the mask may help, and I hope it helps, and I think it probably does. But again, the mask is a mixed bag. There are some people\u2014professionals\u2014Scott, you would know a lot of them\u2014but there are some people that don't like the mask, because of the touchiness and the touching, and then you're touching everything else.

So you think there should be more indictments as a part of this investigation?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I think\u2014just on what I read in your wonderful papers, I think\u2014and see what, you know, just looking at the media\u2014not even what I know. I think Comey is a disgrace to our country. I think Strzok\u2014who just wrote a book, which is a total fake\u2014is a disgrace. I think Page\u2014Lisa Page, his lover\u2014is a disgrace to our country. I think that when you look at McCabe, where his wife got $700,000 in campaign contributions from Hillary Clinton\u2014right?And then Hillary Clinton is under investigation, and yet she paid the head of the FBI\u2014one of the top people, but actually the head, because he took over for the other guy, who fortunately I fired. I made a good move when I fired. That was a smart move, because they were looking to take down this administration, duly elected administration. So I fired him. That was a great move when I fired him. Because maybe, if I didn't, I wouldn't be here talking to you as President.But when McCabe's wife gets $700,000 in campaign contributions when she was running for whatever office she was running from\u2014from Virginia\u2014and yet he's in charge of the investigation of Hillary Clinton. Now, he says, Well, I wasn't really in charge. Of course, he was in charge. He was totally in charge. He knew exactly what was going on.These people got caught in the\u2014probably the biggest political scandal in the history of our country. They got caught.Now, what the Durham report is going to say, I can't tell you. But if they say half as much as I already know\u2014just from seeing it. You know, you have people\u2014I watch some of the shows. I watch Liz McDonald; she's fantastic. I watched Fox Business. I watched Lou Dobbs last night, Sean Hannity last night, Tucker last night, Laura. I watched Fox and Friends in the morning. You watch these shows; you don't have to go too far into the details. They cover things that are\u2014it's really an amazing thing.They got caught in the biggest political scandal in the history of our country. They were spying on their opponent's campaign. Not only spying; they were making up fake dossiers. You have the dirty dossier. They were making up the dirty\u2014and it was all made up. It was all fiction. It turned out to be fiction. And then, they were using that in the FISA courts\u2014this revered court. Well, it's not so revered anymore, because when you look at what they did and how they played it\u2014and they hurt a lot of people.General Flynn is still being hurt, and he's being hurt very badly. He's a wonderful person. I spoke to General Milley about General Flynn 2 weeks ago. I said, What do you think of General Flynn? He said: He's a great soldier, sir. And he's a wonderful, wonderful human being. He's been destroyed. He's been destroyed. No, I think that this\u2014without knowing anything about what Durham is going to release\u2014the Durham report, we'll call it, or maybe it's going to be more than a report. Maybe it's going to be much more than a report, I don't know. Maybe it's a report or maybe it's much more than that.But when I look at the\u2014the things that everybody in this room knows, just from reading about it from yourselves back and forth, I think it's a disgrace to our country. And I think if people don't pay a very, very substantial price, it will happen again. And this should never ever happen to another President.Thank you very much.

John McCain liked wars. I will be a better warrior than anybody, but when we fight a war, we're going to win them. And frankly, I was never a fan of John McCain. You know that; that's been very obvious. I was\u2014but I had to approve his entire\u2014his funeral. I wanted him to get\u2014he deserved a first-class\u2014you know, and it all was approved by me. We sent Air Force One to pick up the casket\u2014a lot of things. But no, I was never a fan of John McCain, because he wanted the endless wars, and I didn't. I thought that the way the vets were taken care of\u2014our great vets\u2014was not good, not appropriate. And of course, he took the fake, dirty dossier and gave it over to the FBI. So this is not somebody\u2014am I supposed to say, What a wonderful guy?So, you know what? I lived with him. He lived with me. But we had different philosophies. I think my philosophy is right. I think it's turned out to be right. But I wasn't a fan. But I respect people, and I respect a lot of people. That doesn't mean I necessarily have to agree with them, and I didn't agree with him on a lot of things.The story is a hoax, written by a guy who has got a tremendously bad history. The magazine itself\u2014which I don't read, but I hear it's just totally anti-Trump; he's a big Obama person, he's a big Clinton person. And he made up the story. It's a totally made-up story.In fact, I was very happy to see Zach Fuentes came out and said now he's\u2014that's\u2014I think that's number 15\u2014and these are people that were there. That's the 15th person. General Kellogg, everybody that was there knew what happened. And so I was happy to see that Zach came out and said it's not true. He just came out.And it's a disgrace. Who would say a thing like that? Only an animal would say a thing like that. There is nobody that has more respect for not only our military, but for people that gave their lives in the military. There's nobody\u2014and I think John Kelly knows that. I think he would know that. I think he knows that from me.But Zach Fuentes, as you know, worked for John. And I think they both know that. But Zach came out, as you know, today or yesterday, last night, and said very strongly that he didn't hear anything like that. Even John Bolton came out and said that was untrue.Now, what was true is that we had the worst weather. I think it was as bad a rain as I've just about ever seen. And it was a fog you\u2014you literally couldn't see. I walked out, and I didn't have\u2014I didn't need somebody to tell me. I walked out and I said, There's no way we can take helicopters in this. I understand helicopters very well. And they said, No, sir, that's been canceled.They would have had to go\u2014Secret Service, I have the whole list\u2014they would have had through a very, very busy section, during the day, of Paris. They would have had to go through the city. The Paris police were asking us, Please don't do it, because they're not ready. When you do that, you need a lot of time. They take days and days and days to prepare for that.I wanted to do it very badly. I was willing to sit in the car for 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours. I didn't care. It didn't matter. And I had nothing else to do. I went there for that; I had nothing else to do. It was ended because of the terrible weather, and nobody was prepared to go through, in terms of Paris, the police, the military, and the Secret Service. And they came out very strongly and said, Sir, we can't allow you to make this trip. If I wanted to: Sir, we can't allow you, from a safety standpoint.It was a phony story, just like the dirty dossier\u2014the fake, dirty dossier; just like the Russia collusion; just like all of the other phony stories. And there'll be more phony stories.But I do appreciate Zach coming out. But Zach now is the 15th person that's denied it. Zach now, I think, also talked about the weather aspect of it. And he's probably the 14th or 15th person that blamed it on weather. So that's enough of that.Yes, please.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHave you asked John Kelly to refute that story?\n\n### Correct Classification ###\nClear Reply\n\nAnalyze step by step and explain why this classification is correct."}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "cot_response", "strict": true, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"step1_question_asks": {"type": "string", "description": "What specific information is the question asking for?"}, "step2_answer_addresses": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the answer directly address this specific question?"}, "step3_information_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Is the information explicit, implicit, or missing entirely?"}, "step4_evasion_check": {"type": "string", "description": "Does the respondent dodge, deflect, or give a partial answer?"}, "reasoning_summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Overall reasoning summary explaining why the given classification is correct"}}, "required": ["step1_question_asks", "step2_answer_addresses", "step3_information_type", "step4_evasion_check", "reasoning_summary"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "temperature": 0.1}}

Do you think that the project should be canceled? The President. Sure. Well, I've been support\u2014I've been supportive of that. I was the first one that brought it up. You never heard of Nord Stream 2 until Trump came along.When I came along, I said: Wait a minute. We're protecting Germany from Russia, right? NATO. We're protecting Germany from Russia. Germany is paying Russia billions and billions of dollars to get their energy. And the real number is, probably 60 to 70 percent, ultimately, of their energy is going to come from Russia. And I said this for years, that nobody talks about it. One of the many things, between sanctions and all of the\u2014what we've done for Ukraine, relative to what the past\u2014they used to send pillows, and we sent tank busters. But I brought that up a long time ago. Russia is unhappy that I brought it up. But you never heard of Nord Stream 2; nobody did, until I got elected.And I said: Why is Germany making a deal to give billions of dollars to Russia, and then we're protecting Germany from Russia? How does that work? And then, on top of it, Germany is delinquent, because they're only paying a little more than 1 percent and they're supposed to be paying 2 percent, and even the 2 percent is low. But just remember: Trump\u2014me\u2014I got the countries of NATO to spend one point\u2014$130 billion, going to $400 billion a year. Think of it: $400 billion a year more for NATO.And the purpose of NATO primarily is Europe protection against Russia. Now, they can use it for other, I guess\u2014and they have a little bit in the Middle East, et cetera, et cetera.But I'm the one that did that. So\u2014but nobody talks about that. Nobody talks about Nord Stream 2.The answer is: Absolutely, if they feel that something happens. But I don't know that Germany is in a position right now, because Germany is in a very weakened position, energy wise. They're closing all their plants. They're closing their nuclear. They're closing their coal. They're closing a lot of plants. And they are\u2014they have put themselves in a very bad position, frankly. Very, very bad position.Yes, please.News Media/Former Chief of Staff John F. Kelly  Q. Mr. President, can I follow up Jeff Mason's [Jeff Mason, Reuters] question?

Did you make that comment at his son's grave?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nJust so you understand, he was a very\u2014if you look at some of his news conferences, what happened to him: He got eaten alive. He was unable to handle the pressure of this job. This job was a tough job. Mark Meadows is doing a great job, but Kelly was unable to do that.And as far as that day, I mean, we have so much proof as to going to the\u2014I went to Paris and the environs, and I was all set to go. They had a rainstorm the likes of which you've rarely seen. The fog was so great; it was as dense as I've ever seen. And I almost knew that you couldn't use the helicopter. And because they had to drive through, I guess, certain parts of Paris, the Secret Service, who\u2014by the way, we have people here that were on the trip. They're writing a report. Unable to even think about it. And I said: Nope, I want to go. I insist on going. It would have taken us forever.The Paris police said, Please, you can't do this. They'd have to shut down various parts of Paris, and it just was not a possible situation. The helicopter would have been very quick. They had the helicopter all set, but the helicopter could never fly in that kind of weather. So\u2014and that turned out\u2014and that's all documented, by the way. We have all of the information from\u2014and probably will release that information.But I think it's a shame when a second-rate magazine\u2014I don't read it; I know very little about this magazine. But when a second-rate magazine can write things like that about somebody that's done so much for the military, can write things like that and get away with it, where you actually ask questions on it, it's a disgrace, and you ought to be ashamed of yourself.And let me just tell you, I watched the interview with Sleepy Joe Biden, and he didn't ask questions. You didn't ask questions like that. Read the questions you asked. They were, like, meant for a child. Those questions were meant for a child. Smiles on faces of reporters\u2014not like you and you. There were smiles on the reporters. What do you think? Take a look at those questions that they ask him.
