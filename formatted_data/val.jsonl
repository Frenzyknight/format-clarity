I have a question for President Lee. Korea and the United States have made many achievements through the summit meeting, especially North Korean nuclear issue and the strengthening of the alliance. As for North Korean nuclear issue, Mr. President Lee suggested setting up a permanent liaison office in both Seoul and Pyongyang. What are some of the follow-up effects, if you do have any follow-up actions? And do you have any thoughts of proposing a meeting with Chairman Kim at an earlier date?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThe process is not something that we discussed between ourselves during the summit meeting. In fact, when I was staying in Washington, DC, I had an interview with one of the newspapers there, and it came up. Of course, it was not a sudden suggestion. I did have a meeting among my staff and related ministries, and I talked about this in detail before I came to the United States.We have a new administration in Korea, and we haven't yet to begun dialogue with the ns. Inter-Korean dialogue, there is a need for us to have dialogue all the time. Up until now, we had dialogues whenever the need arose, and then it would stop. However, dialogue should be based on genuine cooperation and sincerity. And so with this in mind, I thought that it would be helpful to set up a permanent liaison office in both Seoul and Pyongyang.As for the summit meeting between myself and Chairman Kim, I will agree to it when the need is real. And I already said publicly that I am willing to meet with him\u2014not just once, but many times\u2014but if the meeting will yield substantial and real results. I believe only when that is possible, I am ready to meet with him and have sincere dialogue, because that will help to bring about peace and stability of the peninsula.So basically, I do hold that thought, but I'm not suggesting that\u2014to have a meeting with Chairman Kim anytime soon. If the need arises, again, I'm ready to meet with him.

Mr. President\u2014\u2014Potential Coronavirus Vaccine Deployment/Russia's Coronavirus Vaccine Development Efforts  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Two questions on vaccines: First, once a vaccine is ready, who should get it first? The President. I will rely on the doctors to tell me that. I would say probably the elderly. I would say nursing homes. A lot of people said, Would you take it? I said: I'll take it if they want, or I'll go first or last. I'll do whatever they want me to do. But I would think that the elderly, the people that are most vulnerable to the disease. And we're actually making those lists right now, mostly nursing homes and retirement centers. Yes. Q. Second, Russia has approved a vaccine. What do you know about the vaccine? And have you spoken to Russian officials about it?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWe don't know much about it. We hope it works; we do. We hope it works. They cut off certain trials, and we just feel it's important to go through the process.

Good morning to both Presidents. President Bush, I ask you, why do Mexicans want to\u2014why would you think that Mexicans could believe in a reform in migration when for so many years, this was not a possibility nor reality? And what are your chances of coming through with this bill in Congress? And President Calderon, you had lunch with President Fox. Can you tell us what you talked about?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThey talked about . [] Excuse me. I wasn't there. []No, that's a legitimate question, and the question is, why now? Why do I think something positive can happen? Well, first of all, the legislative process takes awhile in the United States. I don't know about Mexico, Mr. President, but sometimes legislators, you know, debate issues for awhile before a solution can be achieved.And we had a very\u2014by the way, we haven't had a serious debate on migration until recently. A law was passed in 1986, and then there really wasn't a serious debate until pretty much starting after the year 2000, if my memory serves me well. I've always known this is an important issue because I happened to have been the Governor of Texas. And so I'm very comfortable about discussing the issue and have elevated the issue over the past years. And Members of Congress have taken the issue very seriously, but it's hard to get legislation out of the Congress on a very complex issue.A lot of Americans were deeply concerned that the United States was not enforcing our laws. They felt like there wasn't a commitment to the rule of law. Over the past year, I believe we have shown the American people that there is a strong commitment to the rule of law. And I think Members of Congress are now feeling more comfortable that the country is committed to rule of law, which then makes some more openminded to my argument, which is that if we can have migration reform, it will make it less likely somebody will feel like they have to sneak across our border, and, therefore, take pressure off the border. In other words, security for the country, border security, will be enhanced by a good migration law, and then it will make it easier for us to focus our assets on drugs, terrorists, criminals, and guns moving both ways.I believe\u2014I feel pretty good about it. I don't want to predict legislative successes. But I can tell you my mood, and my mood is optimistic because the mood in the Congress seems like it has changed from skepticism last year to knowledge that getting a comprehensive bill will be in the Nation's interests.Secondly, I'm optimistic because Republicans in the Senate are working with Democrats in the Senate. We're facilitating that work. The administration is very much involved with helping the Senators find common ground, to the point where we can move a bill as quickly as possible out of the Senate so it gets to the House of Representatives.I'm not a betting man. I don't like to bet, because when I do, I usually lose. But I'm an optimistic man, in this case, about getting comprehensive reform, and a bill is in the interests of both countries. I met with former President Vicente Fox, whom I like, and we have a good friendship. We belong to the same party. I invited him to lunch; we talked for quite a while, talked about matters in a very constructive fashion. And he congratulated us for the work that we've done during these first 100 days. He also said that he had the will to collaborate and cooperate in a respectful fashion with the government for the benefit of Mexicans.I have also met with other former Presidents, and I'm sure that I will continue to meet with President Fox in the future throughout my administration. Here it comes.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nPresident Calderon's discussion topics during lunch with President Fox.\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you very much. Mr. President, I've got a question to Mr. Obama. You just mentioned that Afghanistan is still a dangerous place. While it's a dangerous place, is it the right decision to draw down the force level at a time when it's a dangerous place and meanwhile Afghan forces are less equipped and they cannot fight truly?[The reporter and President Ghani spoke in Pashto, and their remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.] Q. Mr. President, my question is, the peace process\u2014what was your initial\u2014or your request from the United States President?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThe United States has agreed to\u2014with us that the peace process will be led by Afghans, and Afghans will be\u2014will continue this process, and it will be led by Afghans. And this is obvious for us, and we are thankful for the support. . Afghanistan is still a dangerous place. The way it's going to become less dangerous is by Afghan security forces and Afghan police being capable of keeping law and order and security in the country. And that is not going to happen if foreign forces are continually relied upon for the basic security of Afghanistan.So there are going to be specialized areas where we can cooperate, dealing with some of the most vicious terrorist networks. There's going to be intelligence cooperation and counterterrorism cooperation. And there are going to be specialized areas where we can provide logistical support and training and enabling support.But the fact is, is that unless Afghan soldiers and Afghan police are able to maintain security, at some point, someday, the United States and other coalition forces would leave. And the good news is, what we've seen as we've removed ourselves from combat roles is the Afghan security forces have stepped up. And although they're certainly not as well equipped as coalition forces, they're better equipped than the Taliban. They're better equipped than the Haqqani network.And so with the kind of leadership that President Ghani is showing as a Commander in Chief, with the leadership that's being shown by a growing cadre of military officers up and down the military chain, Afghan forces are proving themselves and discovering that, in fact, when they fight, they can be successful. And we want to stand with them in that process because we are very much invested in your success.So, Mr. President, thank you for an outstanding visit. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat was the initial request from the United States President in relation to the peace process?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

President Obama, the Trans-Pacific Partnership seems fairly stalled in Congress, and other countries are looking to follow the U.S. lead in terms of how they advance their approval of the agreement. With the deals today announced for Boeing and GE and your visit here to Vietnam, are you looking to change your strategy in how you seek approval for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in Congress? And do you think that the agreement should be amended to address currency manipulation?Secondly, President Obama, can you comment on the killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansur and on Pakistan's concern about that strike happening on its soil? Can you also comment on whether this signals a new offensive in Afghanistan and whether you're concerned that an even more hardline leader might take his place?For President Quang, are you concerned about the lack of enthusiasm for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the U.S. Congress and what that means for the deal in the end? And how do you respond to China's criticism of the U.S. pursuing what China says is a one-sided, selfish agenda in Asia that risks regional peace?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nSo, first of ll, on TPP, Angel, I hven't been round s long s Sentors Crper or Secretry Kerry, but I've spent enough tie in the Sente to know tht every trde del is pinful, becuse folks re lwys seeing if they cn get n even better del. And especilly when you hve ultiple prties involved, folks re going to be scrutinizing it, they're going to be debting it, nd in n election yer, you cn nticipte tht soe folks re going to try to score politicl points off it.Hving sid tht, I rein confident we're going to get it done. And the reson I' confident is becuse it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country. It's good for Aeric. It's good for the regio It's good for the world.And I know I've sold this to you before, but let e reiterte: This is the fstest growing prt of the world. This represents n enorous rket for the United Sttes. Most countries here lredy sell their stuff to the United Sttes, nd we hve reltively low triffs. In other words, we put reltively low txes on goods tht re coing into the United Sttes. In contrst, triffs re significntly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So del tht gets rid of 18,000 txes on U.S. goods into the lrgest, fstest growing rkets of the world, tht's good del for Aericn businesses nd Aericn workers.Nuber two, one of the biggest coplints bout trde dels historiclly hs been tht it opens up our rkets to countries with lower wges, hrsher lbor prctices, less environentl regultio Well, if you're signing up for the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, you re king coitents tht re enforceble to rise lbor stndrds, to ensure tht workers hve voice, to ttend to environentl probles. And so this gives us the bility to engge with country like Vietn nd work with the on ll those fronts, the precise things tht people, in the pst, hve been concerned bout when it coes to trding with other countries.So I hve not yet seen credible rguent tht once we get TPP in plce we're going to be worse off. We re deonstrbly better off. Aericn workers nd Aericn businesses re better off if we get this del pssed. And I' confident we will get it pssed.Now, the politics of it will be noisy. Tht ws true when I, for exple, inherited the Koren free trde greeent or the Colobin nd Pnnin free trde greeents when I ce into office. But we got the done. And I' confident tht we'll get the done this tie, s well, lthough it will\u2014there will be ups nd downs nd bups long the wy.With respect to currency nipultion, we hve provisions in TPP tht dvnce the trnsprency nd reporting functions tht llow us to onitor whether we think tht currency nipultion is tking plce. One of the debtes tht took plce\u2014nd there hve been soe who rgue tht we should hve enforceble provisions tht if you see currency going down too fr tht we should be ble to ipose triffs on tht country. The proble is, is tht it's very hrd to sort out soeties why currency is going down nd whether it's ctully being nipulted. And frnkly, for us to bind other countries to coitents bout their onetry policy would en we were lso binding our Federl Reserve to the clis of other countries in ters of how it ipleents our onetry policy, nd tht's not soething tht we would do. We would not give up sovereignty with respect to our onetry policy in tht wy. But we hve strengthened nuber of the provisions tht re lredy contined in TPP tht will llow us to put on notice folks who we think re engging in copetitive devlutions.Finlly, on the Tlibn leder, Mr. Mnsur, it hs been confired tht he is ded. And he is n individul who, s hed of the Tlibn, ws specificlly trgeting U.S. personnel nd troops inside of Afghnistn who were there s prt of the ission tht I've set to be ble to intin counterterroris pltfor nd provide ssistnce nd trining to the Afghn ilitry forces there. So this does not represent shift in our pproch. We re not reentering the dy-to-dy cobt opertions tht re currently being conducted by Afghn security forces. Our job is to help Afghnistn secure its own country, not to hve our en nd woen in unifor engge in tht fight for the.On the other hnd, where we hve high-profile leder who hs been consistently prt of opertions nd plns to potentilly hr U.S. personnel nd who hs been resistnt to the kinds of pece tlks nd reconcilition tht ultitely could bring n end to decdes of wr in Afghnistn, then it is y responsibility s Conder in Chief not to stnd by, but to ke sure tht we send cler signl to the Tlibn nd others tht we're going to protect our people. And tht's exctly the essge tht hs been sent. President ung. Let e respond to this question concerning the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, TPP. In our view, TPP is significnt trde nd econoic linkge, contributing to sustining the dynis nd the role s driver for econoic growth in our country, s well s in the Asi-Pcific regio And for Vietn, TPP nd Vietn's prticiption in TPP is one step undertken by the Vietnese Governent in our process of extensive interntionl integrtio President Ob. Mr. President, sorry to interrupt. We're not getting trnsltio Testing one, two, three. President Ob. For you? Cn you her, Mr. President? President Ob. Oky. Testing one, two, three. President Ob. It's just, I' sure tht he ws sying soething very wise nd iportnt, nd we wnted to ke sure tht we ll herd it. President ung. So I would like to dd tht Vietn, together with other TPP countries, hve been king efforts to nrrow differences, to proote coopertion in the spirit of utul understnding nd utul respect. And we will try to reduce differences in spirit of constructiveness nd understnding nd pying ttention to one nother's legitite interests. And the finliztion of TPP is lso the successful outcoes of ll 12 ebers of the TPP, rther thn ny individul effort. And we re prepred to rtify TPP, nd we stnd redy to ipleent ll the coitents under TPP.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nCan you comment on the killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansur and on Pakistan's concern about that strike happening on its soil?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

And are you getting any indications that Iran is interested in a dialog with the United States?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI said during the campaign that is a country that has extraordinary people, extraordinary history and traditions, but that its actions over many years now have been unhelpful when it comes to promoting peace and prosperity both in the region and around the world; that their attacks or their financing of terrorist organizations like Hizballah and Hamas, the bellicose language that they've used towards Israel, their development of a nuclear weapon, or their pursuit of a nuclear weapon, that all those things create the possibility of destabilizing the region and are not only contrary to our interests, but I think are contrary to the interests of international peace. What I've also said is that we should take an approach with that employs all of the resources at the United States disposal, and that includes diplomacy.And so my national security team is currently reviewing our existing policy, looking at areas where we can have constructive dialog, where we can directly engage with them. And my expectation is in the coming months we will be looking for openings that can be created where we can start sitting across the table, face to face, diplomatic overtures that will allow us to move our policy in a new direction.There's been a lot of mistrust built up over the years, so it's not going to happen overnight. And it's important that even as we engage in this direct diplomacy, we are very clear about certain deep concerns that we have as a country: that understands that we find the funding of terrorist organizations unacceptable; that we're clear about the fact that a nuclear could set off a nuclear arms race in the region that would be profoundly destabilizing.So there are going to be a set of objectives that we have in these conversations, but I think that there's the possibility at least of a relationship of mutual respect and progress. And I think that if you look at how we've approached the Middle East, my designation of George Mitchell as a special envoy to help deal with the Arab-Israeli situation, some of the interviews that I've given, it indicates the degree to which we want to do things differently in the region. Now it's time for to send some signals that it wants to act differently as well, and recognize that even as it has some rights as a member of the international community, with those rights come responsibilities.Okay.

The common denominator in the strife in Ukraine and Syria is the support that those two governments get from Russia, and I'm wondering, sir, if you believe that President Putin bears some responsibility for the intransigence of those two regimes. And to some degree, has this gone beyond just those two countries, and has it become a tug of war between two world powers?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nLet me answer very briefly on the trade issue It's not accurate, Jim, to say that my party opposes this trade deal There are elements in my party that opposes this trade deal, there are elements in my party that opposed the South Korea free trade agreement, the Colombia free trade agreement, and the Panama free trade agreement, all of which we passed with Democratic votesSo what I've said to President Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Prime Minister Harper is, we'll get this passed if it's a good agreement And the key at this point is to make sure that our countries, which hold ourselves up as champions of free trade, resolve our legitimate national interests in these negotiations so that we can present a united front against a number of the other participants in the TPP negotiations who don't have as much of a tradition of free trade And that is to our advantage, precisely because North America has this amazing competitive advantage and we are already relatively open marketsAnd part of our goal here is to make sure that the Asia-Pacific region\u2014which is growing faster than anyplace else in the world, has a larger population than anyplace else in the world\u2014that they have a model of trade that is free and fair and open and allows our businesses to compete and allows our workers to make goods and deliver services that those markets are purchasing And we can only do that if we raise the bar in terms of what our trade models look likeAnd I've said this to some of my own constituents who are opposed to trade: that those who are concerned about losing jobs or outsourcing need to understand, some of the old agreements put us at a disadvantage That's exactly why we've got to have stronger agreements that protect our intellectual property, that open up markets to our agricultural products, that make sure that when it comes to government procurement or sovereign wealth funds in these other countries, that they're not taking advantage of our businesses and preventing us from competing there That's exactly why we've got to get this done And I'm very appreciative of the shared vision and commitment that Prime Minister Harper and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto have on this issueNow, with respect to Syria and the Ukraine, I do think it is worth noting that you have in this situation one country that has clearly been a client state of Russia, another whose Government is currently\u2014been supported by Russia, where the people obviously have a very different view and vision for their country And we've now seen a great deal of turmoil there that arose organically from within those countriesI don't think there's a competition between the United States and Russia I think this is an expression of the hopes and aspirations of people inside of Syria and people inside of the Ukraine who recognize that basic freedoms\u2014freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, fair and free elections, the ability to run a business without paying a bribe, to not be discriminated against because of your religion or your beliefs\u2014that those are fundamental rights that everybody wants to enjoyNow, Mr Putin has a different view on many of those issues, and I don't think that there's any secret on that And our approach as the United States is not to see these as some Cold War chessboard in which we're in competition with Russia Our goal is to make sure that the people of Ukraine are able to make decisions for themselves about their future, that the people of Syria are able to make decisions without having bombs going off and killing women and children, or chemical weapons, or towns being starved because a despot wants to cling to powerThose express our values and our national interests, and we will continue to express those national interests There are times, I hope, where Russia will recognize that over the long term they should be on board with those values and interests as well Right now there are times where we have strong disagreements And when I speak to Mr Putin, I'm very candid about those disagreements, even as we will continue to pursue cooperation with Russia on areas where we have shared concernsBut I want to emphasize this: The situation that happened in Ukraine has to do with whether or not the people of Ukraine can determine their own destiny And my Government and Vice President Biden, and I personally, have expressed to President Yanukovych the need for him to recognize the spirit of the Ukrainian people and work with that, as opposed to trying to repress it And so we'll continue to stand on the side of the peopleMy hope is, at this point, that a truce may hold, but Stephen's exactly right Ultimately, the Government is responsible for making sure that we shift towards some sort of unity government, even if it's temporary, that allows us to move to fair and free elections so that the will of the Ukrainian people can be rightly expressed without the kinds of chaos we've seen on the streets and without the bloodshed that all of us, I think, strongly condemnPrime Minister Harper I'll just\u2014on the issue of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as I said, we are wanting to see and committed to seeing a good, comprehensive Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement I think it's in all of our interests for the reasons that have already been laid out That said, the Government of Canada's position is always clear in these matters that we will only come to an agreement when we are convinced the agreement is in the best interest of Canada And we will stay at the table as long as it takes to get to that particular situationAnd I think we have the track record to prove it Our Government, the current Government of Canada, has signed more trade agreements than all previous Canadian governments combined What I would say is this\u2014I'm not going to comment on the process in Congress What I would say is this: The reason I said what I said about working until we get an agreement that is in the interest of Canada is we will have to have an agreement that can be sold to the Canadian Parliament and ultimately to the Canadian people And that's what we're aiming for[]I repeat: In regard to the Trans-Pacific agreement\u2014alliance and in regard to our relations with the Asia-Pacific region, we have our own perspective And we will negotiate up to the point where we will have an agreement on the table And we need to show that our administration has subscribed more agreements than any other previous administrations And so for the Canadian Government, it is essential to note that we can submit these proposals to the Canadian Parliament and of the line\u2014[inaudible] President Pe\u00f1a Nieto The Mexican stand has been very clear, and specifically, our take on the TPP, we have always stated it: It is of the interest of Mexico We have been part of the negotiation rounds to eventually reach an agreement of this important opportunity that the TPP offers We can expand the potential of North America into the Asia-Pacific region Mexico would do its best for the sake of Mexico to be on the side of the solution, overcome disagreements and eventual roadblocks that the negotiation rounds present And we hope that it is this spirit that we reach the agreementMexico has made a commitment and has shown political will to be part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership We hope that the deal happens That is the Mexican stand, and we will work to the best of our ability to reach this goalNow, on behalf of Mexico, Miguel Reyes Razo, from the Mexican Editorial Organization, will ask a

While you've been here in the country, in the capital, the northeast part of Delhi, there have been violent clashes. Police have been killed, some demonstrators. Nine deaths so far, we hear, and about a hundred-plus injured. What did Prime Minister Modi say to you about this amended citizenship law? And how concerned are you about this kind of religious violence in India? The President. So we did talk about religious freedom. And I will say that the Prime Minister was incredible on what he told me. He wants people to have religious freedom, and very strongly. And he said that in India they have worked very hard to have great and open religious freedom. And if you look back and look at what's going on, relative to other places especially, but they have really worked hard on religious freedom.I asked that question in front of a very large group of people today. And he talked about it; we talked about it for a long time. And I really believe that's what he wants.As far as the individual attack, I heard about it, but I didn't discuss that with him.

I was wondering, do you think justice was served in the Harvey Weinstein case?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nSo I was never a fan of Harvey Weinstein, as you know. In fact, he said he was going to work hard to defeat me in the election. How did that work out, by the way? I'm trying to figure that out.He was a person I didn't like, never liked. I don't know too much about the case because, as you know, I've been over here. Between traveling and being at meetings almost every hour of the day, every minute of the day, I haven't been able to really see too much of it.But I was just not a fan of his. I knew him a little bit, not very well. I knew him because he was in New York. Not a person that I like.I will say, the people that liked him were the Democrats. Michelle Obama loved him. Loved him. Hillary Clinton loved him. And he gave tremendous money to the Democrats.And I guess my question is: Will the Democrats be asking for that money back? Because he gave a lot of money to the Democrats. And you know, it's too bad, but that's the way it worked out.Yes, Peter [Peter Alexander, NBC News].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHi, sir, Emily Goodwin with the DailyMail.com.

He's a great guy. I did see the report. We're going to look into the report, and we're going to take it very seriously. Because we're going to have a major announcement, probably next week, on the drug crisis and on the opioid massive problem. And I want to get that absolutely right.

President Bush, your decision to sign legislation authorizing construction of a fence along the U.S.-Mexico border was not viewed positively here in the region. How would you respond to critics who feel that that sent a message that Latin Americans are not welcome in the United States?And, President Berger, what are your thoughts on the idea of a fence, the U.S. border policy in regard to a fence?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI did sign legislation modernizing our border. It was more than just fence; it was infrastructure\u2014kind of a novel infrastructure, like detection devices, berms. We've got a very long border, and it needs to be enforced. It needs to be enforced not only to stop s, but it needs to be enforced to stop drugs. It needs to be enforced to stop potential terrorists, and it needs to be enforced to stop arms\u2014by the way, arms that sometimes go the other way\u2014I'm told. And so we've got to have border. That's what countries do; they enforce their borders.And so we modernized the border. It was more than just fence. And I understand it sent a signal that said, you're not welcome. Quite the contrary: People are welcome, but under the law. There are thousands of people in our country who are not citizens who are there legally. The question is, what do we do with people who have been there over years, the result of a law that isn't working well? And I've already given that answer.I will also explain that part of convincing people that a comprehensive plan can work is to assure the American people that we're doing our duty by enforcing law. In other words, a lot of citizens said, You just don't care about whether or not we have a border that's secure. And the Congress responded by saying, Of course, we care. It is the first step toward a comprehensive bill. In other words, people in Congress were saying, Let us do something about border enforcement, and then let's go comprehensive. I hope that's what they're saying.In other words, that's what I'm pressing them to say. Okay, we've responded to the needs of border enforcement; there are people being sent back. As a matter of fact, I think it's interesting\u2014and frankly, I didn't anticipate this\u2014that the good press corps of Guatemala, reflecting the concerns of the Guatemalan people, and the President of Guatemala reflecting the concerns, asked me about deportations. I mean, that was a primary concern. It means that something is\u2014the law is being enforced, is what that means.The American people need to be persuaded, Elaine, that the Government takes our responsibilities seriously, which then will make it easier to convince reluctant Members of Congress to come up with a comprehensive plan.Now, I've always been for a comprehensive plan. You might remember, if you look back at some of my speeches\u2014I know you didn't listen to any of them, but you might want to go back and read them. [] Well, that's not fair. Okay, anyway, but I've always felt it was important. And I learned firsthand how important it was as the Governor of Texas. I used to say, family values do not stop at the Rio Grande River and that people are coming to do jobs Americans are not doing because they want to feed their families. That's why I said that.By the way, the reason why trade is important in helping the programs like Labradores Mayas is that I also believe most citizens in Guatemala would rather find meaningful jobs at home instead of having to travel to a foreign land to work. And therefore, the more we can enhance prosperity in our neighborhood, the more we can encourage trade that actually yields jobs and stability, the less likely it is somebody who is worried about putting food on the table for their family will be coming to the United States.Anyway, I thank you for your interest on the topic, Mr. President. It's been a wonderful press conference. Thank you. I would like to close with that topic: the American Dream for everyone. And we can have that American Dream in our own countries by promoting education, by improving infrastructure, by implementing CAFTA, which is a very interesting tool to produce and to export and also to attract investment and generate jobs. I would believe that we are firm along those lines and that the American Dream is going to be the dream for all the Americans living in the American Continent.Thank you very much. Thank you all.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat are your thoughts on the idea of a fence and the U.S. border policy in regard to a fence?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

High quality. High-quality family. I just met them. And I explained what happened. I explained that Washington can be a very mean place. You don't know about that, Chancellor. [] A nasty place.The false accusations that were made about him by Senator Tester, from a great State\u2014I don't think that State is going to put up with it. These were false accusations about a great man, about a man who has a son who is a top student at Annapolis, about a man that's given his life to this country and to the military. A brave man. He would have been a great leader.To say the kind of things that he said\u2014you had President Obama giving him an A-plus report. You had President Bush giving him an A-plus report. You have giving him an A-plus report. And to make statements of things that most people said never happened, never even happened.

Thank you, Mr. President. Arigato, Mr. Prime Minister. Mr. President, in regards to the Senkaku Islands, I just want to make sure that this is absolutely clear. Are you saying that the U.S. would consider using military force were China to have some sort of military incursion in those islands to protect those islands? And how does that not draw another red line that you would have to enforce, putting U.S. credibility, your credibility on the line once again, as it was in the case with Syria and Russia? And on another key security issue, you mentioned North Korea in your meeting with the Prime Minister. Are you issuing a warning to North Korea that there should not be another nuclear test?And to Prime Minister Abe, do you have confidence in President Obama's assurances about your security when the U.S. and the West were unable to stop Russia's advances in Ukraine? Thank you. President Obama. Well, Jim, let me unpack that question because there's a whole bunch of assumptions in there, some of which I don't agree with.First of all, the treaty between the United States and Japan preceded my birth, so obviously, this isn't a red line that I'm drawing, it is the standard interpretation over multiple administrations of the terms of the alliance, which is that territories under the administration of Japan are covered under the treaty. There's no shift in position. There's no red line that's been drawn. We're simply applying the treaty.At the same time, as I've said directly to the Prime Minister: that it would be a profound mistake to continue to see escalation around this issue rather than dialogue and confidence-building measures between Japan and China. And we are going to do everything we can to encourage that diplomatically.With respect to the other issues that you raise, our position, Jim\u2014the United States position\u2014is that countries should abide by international law; that those laws, those rules, those norms are violated when you gas children or when you invade the territory of another country. Now, the implication of the question, I think, is, is that each and every time a country violates one of those norms, the United States should go to war or stand prepared to engage militarily, and if it doesn't, then somehow we're not serious about those norms. Well, that's not the case.Right now we have 87 percent of Syria's chemical weapons have already been removed from Syria. There's about 13 percent left. That's as a consequence of U.S. leadership. And the fact that we didn't have to fire a missile to get that accomplished is not a failure to uphold those international norms, it's a success. It's not a complete success until we have the last 13 percent out.With respect to Russia and Ukraine, we've been very clear about the fact that there's not going to be a military solution to the problem in Ukraine, but we have already applied sanctions that have had an impact on the Russian economy, and we have continued to hold out the prospect\u2014the possibility\u2014to resolve this issue diplomatically. There was some possibility that Russia could take the wiser course after the meetings in Geneva. So far at least, we have seen them not abide by the spirit or the letter of the agreement in Geneva. And instead, we continue to see militias and armed men taking over buildings, harassing folks who are disagreeing with them, and destabilizing the region, and we haven't seen Russia step up and discourage that.On the other side, you've seen the Government in Kiev take very concrete steps, in introducing an amnesty law and offering a whole range of reforms with respect to the Constitution, that are consistent with what was discussed in Geneva. And my expectation is, is that if, once again, Russia fails to abide by both the spirit and the letter of what was discussed in Geneva, that there will be further consequences and we will ramp up further sanctions.That doesn't mean that the problem is going to be solved right away. These are difficult issues. But what we try to do is to make sure that we are very clear about what we stand for, what we believe in, and we are willing to take actions on behalf of those values, those norms, and those ideals.

This is Mark Riley from 7News, Australia. Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about the other rising giant of our region, India. And the Prime Minister might like to add some comments. How significant is it for the U.S. that Australia is now considering selling uranium to India? And could you clear up for us what influence or encouragement your administration gave Australia as it made that decision?And also, the decision is so India can produce clean energy. In that regard, you're aware that our Parliament has passed a new bill pricing carbon, a carbon tax, if you like. But we're intrigued about where America is going on this issue. And countries like Australia don't see a carbon trading system in the world working unless America is a big part of it. Can you tell us, is it your wish that American will have an emissions trading scheme across the Nation within the next 5 years or so? How heavily do you want to see America involved in an emissions trading scheme globally? Or has this become too politically hard for you?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nGood. Well, first of all, with respect to India, we have not had any influence, I suspect, on Australia's decision to explore what its relationship in terms of the peaceful use of nuclear energy in India might be. I suspect that you've got some pretty smart Government officials here who figured out that India is a big player and that the Australia-India relationship is one that should be cultivated. So they--I don't think Julia or anybody else needs my advice in figuring that out. This is part of your neighborhood, and you are going to make bilateral decisions about how to move forward.I think, without wading into the details, the discussions that are currently taking place here in Australia around that relationship and the nuclear issue with India are ones that are compatible with international law, compatible with decisions that were made in the NPT. And I will watch with interest what's determined. But this is not something between the United States and Australia, this is something between India and Australia.With respect to carbon emissions, I think I share the view of your Prime Minister and most scientists in the world that climate change is a real problem and that human activity is contributing to it and that we all have a responsibility to find ways to reduce our carbon emissions.Each country is trying to figure out how to do that most effectively. Here in Australia, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, you've moved forward with a bold strategy. In the United States, although we haven't passed a what we call a cap-and-trade system, an exchange, what we have done is, for example, taken steps to double fuel efficiency standard on cars, which will have an enormous impact on removing carbon from the atmosphere.We've invested heavily in clean energy research. We believe very strongly that with improved efficiencies and a whole step--a whole range of steps that we can meet and the commitments that we made in Copenhagen and Cancun. And as we move forward over the next several years, my hope is, is that the United States, as one of several countries with a big carbon footprint, can find further ways to reduce our carbon emissions. I think that's good for the world. I actually think, over the long term, it's good for our economies as well, because it's my strong belief that industries, utilities, individual consumers, we're all going to have to adapt how we use energy and how we think about carbon.Now, another belief that I think the Prime Minister and I share is that the advanced economies can't do this alone. So part of our insistence when we are in multilateral fora--and I will continue to insist on this when we go to Durban--is that if we are taking a series of steps, then it's important that emerging economies like China and India are also part of the bargain. It doesn't mean that they have to do exactly what we do. We understand that in terms of per capita carbon emissions, they've got a long way to go before they catch up to us. But it does mean that they've got to take seriously their responsibilities as well.And so ultimately, what we want is a mechanism whereby all countries are making an effort. And it's going to be a tough slog, particularly at a time when the economies are--a lot of economies are still struggling. But I think it's actually one that over the long term can be beneficial.Jackie Calmes [New York Times].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow heavily do you want to see America involved in an emissions trading scheme globally?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Mr. President, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about budget process. In the past, you've negotiated along with the debt ceiling with the Blue Dogs, for instance, in 2009, 2010\u2014along with a debt ceiling increase then. Pay-as-you-go reform, you named a fiscal commission. The Republicans today are talking about maybe another committee that would work out our differences over the next few weeks. Is that something that you could talk about on the side, something that wouldn't necessarily be a concession, but something that would be a format for getting a deal done?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes, here's the thing, Steven. I know that Speaker Boehner has talked about setting up some new process or some new supercommittee or what have you. The leaders up in Congress, they can work through whatever processes they want. But the bottom line is either you're having good-faith negotiations in which there's give and take, or you're not.Now, there is already a process in place called the Budget Committees that could come together right now\u2014Democrats have been asking for 19 months to bring them together\u2014make a determination how much should the Government be spending next year. The Appropriations Committees could go through the list, and here's how much we're going to be spending for defense and here's how much we're going to be spending for education. And that's a process that's worked reasonably well for the last 50 years. I don't know that we need to set up a new committee for a process like that to move forward.What has changed, or what seems to be motivating the idea we have to have a new process is, Speaker Boehner, or at least some faction of the Republicans in the House and maybe some in the Senate, are holding out for a negotiation in theory, but in fact, basically, Democrats give a lot of concessions to Republicans, Republicans don't give anything, and then that's dubbed as compromise. And the reason that Democrats have to give is because they're worried that the Government is going to stay shut down or the U.S. Government is going to default.And again, that\u2014you can dress it up any way you want. If that's the theory that the Republicans are going forward with, then it's not going to work.So let me just give you one specific example. I've heard at least\u2014and I can't confirm this\u2014that one of the ideas of this new committee is, you could talk about reductions in discretionary spending, you could talk about entitlement reform and reductions in mandatory spending, you could talk about how long you'd extend the debt ceiling, but you couldn't talk about closing corporate loopholes that aren't benefiting ordinary folks economically and, potentially, if you closed them, would allow us to pay for things like better education for kids.Well, I don't know why Democrats right now would agree to a format that takes off the table all the things they care about and is confined to the things that the Republicans care about.So again, I don't know that that's exactly what's being proposed. My simple point is this: I think Democrats in the Senate and the House are prepared to talk about anything. I'm prepared to talk about anything. They can design whatever formats they want. What is not fair and will not result in an actual deal is ransom-taking or hostage-taking, and the expectation that Democrats are paying ransom or providing concessions for the mere act of reopening the Government or paying our bills. Those are not things that you do for me, and they're not things that you do for the Democrats.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nIs creating another committee to work out differences a possible format for getting a deal done?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Mark Kenny from the Advertiser\u2014 Mr. President, both sides have stressed that the alliance is in perfect working order and good nick. But how can that be the case? How can the alliance remain unchanged given that Australia has signaled new foreign policy with quite different positions from yours on things like Iraq, climate change, and potentially over China?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI guess it depends if you're a half-glass-empty guy or a halfglass-full guy. It sounds like to me our foreign policy interests are aligned. You know, after all, we've committed to an international agreement that will be effective when it comes to greenhouse gases. The Prime Minister just defined his desire to help this young democracy in Iraq succeed. That's what we're for.So I don't see differences when it comes to foreign policy. As a matter of fact, I see common agreement. And one reason why is, is because we share the same values. And those values are more important than the people who actually occupy the office, by the way. Those are the values that allow 12 U.S. Presidents and 14 Australian Prime Ministers to be united in common goals. And so I disagree with the assessment of whatever expert laid that out.Steven Lee [Steven Lee Myers, New York Times].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow can the alliance remain unchanged given that Australia has signaled new foreign policy with quite different positions from yours on Iraq?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

We've got this NATO summit. Typically, what's happened is, is that we try to attach the G-8 summit to the NATO summit so that the leaders in the G-8 summit don't have to travel twice to whatever location. So, last year, in France, we combined a G-8 with a NATO summit. We'll do so again.I have to say, this was an idea that was brought to me after the initial organizing of the NATO summit. Somebody pointed out that I hadn't had any of my counterparts, who I've worked with now for 3 years, up to Camp David. G-8 tends to be a more informal setting in which we talk about a wide range of issues in a pretty intimate way. And the thinking was that people would enjoy being in a more casual backdrop. I think the weather should be good that time of year. It will give me a chance to spend time with Mr. Putin, the new Russian President. And from there, we will then fly to Chicago.I always have confidence in Chicago being able to handle security issues. Whether it's Taste of Chicago or Lollapalooza--[]--or Bulls championships, we know how to deal with a crowd. And I'm sure that your new mayor will be quite attentive to detail in making sure that everything goes off well.All right? Okay.

Does it not carry more weight than any of the others?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThat's an interesting question. It's certainly an important part of our deliberations, and it was certainly an important part of our discussions this morning. Some reports are issued and just gather dust. And truth of the matter is, a lot of reports in Washington are never read by anybody.To show you how important this one is, I read it, and our guest read it. The Prime Minister read a report prepared by a commission. And this is important. And there are some\u2014I don't think Jim Baker and Lee Hamilton expect us to accept every recommendation. I expect them\u2014I think\u2014I know they expect us to consider every recommendation, Jim, that we ought to pay close attention to what they advise. And I told them yesterday at our meeting that we would pay close attention and would seriously consider every recommendation. We've discussed some of their recommendations here at this press conference. And we are\u2014we will spend a lot of time on it.And I\u2014and so you ask its relative importance. I'd call it a very important report and a very important part of our working to a new approach, a new way forward in Iraq.And I can't\u2014I really do thank those citizens for taking time out of busy lives to spend time helping us look at different options. These are distinguished souls. They got plenty to do. They're busy people, and yet they took 9 months out. And they talked to a lot of people; they went to Iraq; they thought about it a lot. And it was a very considerate, important report. And I will take their recommendations very seriously.

Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to follow up on Israel and Iran, because you have said repeatedly you have Israel's back. And so I wonder why, 3 years in office, you have not visited Israel as President. And related to Iran and Israel, you have expressed concern about this loose talk of war, as you call it, driving up gas prices further. Your critics will say on Capitol Hill that you want gas prices to go higher because you have said before, that will wean the American people off fossil fuels, onto renewable fuels. How do you respond to that?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nEd, just from a political perspective, do you think the President of the United States going into reelection wants gas prices to go up higher? [] Is that--is there anybody here who thinks that makes a lot of sense?Look, here's the bottom line with respect to gas prices. I want gas prices lower because they hurt families. Because I meet folks every day who have to drive a long way to get to work, and them filling up this gas tank gets more and more painful, and it's a tax out of their pocketbooks, out of their paychecks, and a lot of folks are already operating on the margins right now.And it's not good for the overall economy, because when gas prices go up, consumer spending oftentimes pulls back. And we're in the midst right now of a recovery that is starting to build up steam, and we don't want to reverse it.What I have also said about gas prices is that there is no silver bullet and the only way we're going to solve this problem over the medium and long term is with an all-of-the-above strategy that says we're going to increase production, which has happened; we are going to make sure that we are conserving energy--that's why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars, which will save consumers about $1.7 trillion and take about 12 billion barrels of oil offline, which will help to reduce prices; and we're going develop clean energy technologies that allow us to continue to use less oil.And we've made progress. I mean, the good news is, 2010, first time in a decade that our oil imports were actually below 50 percent, and they have kept on going down. And we're going to keep on looking at every strategy we can to, yes, reduce the amount of oil that we use, while maintaining our living standards and maintaining our productivity and maintaining our economic growth, and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that consumers aren't hurt by it.Now, there are some short-term steps that we're looking at with respect to--for example, there are certain potential bottlenecks in refineries around the country that we've been concerned about. We're concerned about what's happening in terms of production around the world. It's not just what's happening in the Gulf. You've had, for example, in Sudan, some oil that's been taken offline that's helping to restrict supply.So we're going to look at a whole range of measures, including, by the way, making sure that my Attorney General is paying attention to potential speculation in the oil markets. We--I've asked him to reconstitute a Task Force that's examining that.But we go through this every year. We've gone through this for 30 years. And if we are going to be competitive, successful, and make sure families are protected over the long term, then we've got to make sure that we've got a set of options that reduce our overall dependence on oil.And with respect to Israel, I am not the first President who has been unable, because of a whole range of issues, not to visit Israel as President in their first term. I visited Israel twice as Senator, once right before I became President. The measure of my commitment to Israel is not measured by a single visit. The measure of my commitment to Israel is seen in the actions that I've taken as President of the United States. And it is indisputable that I've had Israel's back over the last 3 years.Aamer Madhani [USA Today].Radio Talk Show Host Rush Limbaugh/\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow do you respond to the criticism that you want gas prices to go higher to encourage a shift to renewable fuels\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

So what's your response to them? And wouldn't that argue for a stronger Federal response?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell look you just saw it. Other countries\u2014we're doing much better than all other major countries peer countries. This chart came out just a little while ago. I thought I'd say\u2014see it's that kind of a question\u2014a wise-guy question\u2014because I just went over the whole thing. We're doing better than almost everyone with the economy. And I think we're\u2014you know we face a headwind because Democrats perhaps for political reasons don't want to open up their States. And that's having a huge toll\u2014that's taking a huge toll on people within those States.When you look at North Carolina you have\u2014a man doesn't want to open it up. You have\u2014you look at Michigan you look at some States\u2014I mean they just want to keep these people in their houses in their prisons. They call them prisons. And I think a lot of it is for political reasons because they want to look as bad as possible on November 3. But I don't think it's going to matter because we're doing so well in so many ways.As far as the plague is concerned when you look at the numbers take a look at what's going on now with other countries they're having flare-ups that are very very substantial and we've done very well. We're helping a lot of those countries. And those were model countries that you used to talk about and say how well they were doing except they just exploded. They just had very big flare-ups. You understand that. No we're doing very well. And I don't have to show you the charts again but those charts are at a level that nobody even thought possible.I think we're going to have a fantastic third quarter. I think next year will be one of the strongest years we've had. And this is with California being closed down. This is where North Carolina and Michigan and tremendous States\u2014great States\u2014are being closed by\u2014for reasons I think that would\u2014that Scott would tell you\u2014you would disagree with right?

The woman who passed away, did she travel to South Korea, or is she a case of community spread?Director Redfield. Oops. Yes, the case\u2014again, this is why we're talking about the community cases with no link to travel. So the investigation at this time shows no evidence of link to travel or a known contact. Q. Okay. And also, you said that Americans as a whole are at a low risk. Are Americans on the West Coast of the United States at a low risk? And are you considering restricting travel within the United States?Director Redfield. So I just want to emphasize again that the Americans, independent of where they live in this Nation, are at low risk. All right? And we're going to continue to evaluate aggressively these unlinked cases as we see them. And as we learn, we'll obviously communicate that.Border Security/Mexico's Immigration Enforcement Cooperation With U.S./Coronavirus Containment Efforts  Q. Thank you so much, Mr. President. Why are you considering closing the border with Mexico, since there are so many more cases here than there? And another question: Are you working with the governments from Brazil and Mexico to try to coordinate a response about this?

So many things have happened so positive.But meeting with people\u2014I had a great meeting, in my opinion. Of course, the fake news didn't cover it that way. But I had a great meeting with President Putin of Russia. I think it was a great meeting. In terms of the future, in terms of safety and economic development and protecting Israel and protecting everybody, I thought it was a great meeting.Great meeting with NATO. I just explained NATO. Hundreds of billions of dollars more money will be paid into NATO, the coffers of NATO. And much already has.So I believe in meeting. I would certainly meet with if they wanted to meet. I don't know that they're ready yet. They're having a hard time right now. But I ended the deal; it was a ridiculous deal.

So Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have both said they want to see more money for testing. They want to send billions of dollars to the States so they can do more testing.

And are you in favor of more money for testing?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, we've done more testing, by far, than anybody. Some of the tests\u2014because it is massive volume\u2014it takes longer. Others of the tests, as you know, are very quick; they're 5 minutes and 15-minute tests. And those are, frankly, the ones that I prefer.But we're doing massive numbers, and the numbers are coming down. And as we go, as an example, there are thousands and thousands of kits being made right now which give you a 15-minute and a 5-minute test. So we'll be able to get those numbers down. Those numbers are similar in other places. They're also doing massive numbers, numbers like nobody thought possible. But those numbers will be coming down. I agree.

And if I may, could I ask the other question, because I think it might get an interesting response. You, last May, passed a milestone in that you are now were President longer when the country was at war than your predecessor, George W. Bush. And if you complete your Presidency, as you will, with troops in Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq, you will be the only two-term President in American history to have served with the country at war. And I wonder, given the way that you ran for office and the aspirations you brought into office, how you feel about that reality?

That was an interesting question so\u2014first of all, with respect to the State Department, I am concerned. And the challenge that we've got is primarily driven by the changing nature of how information flows. Look, the advent of e-mail and texts and smartphones is just generating enormous amounts of data. Now, it is hugely convenient. It means that in real time I'm getting information that some of my predecessors might not have gotten for weeks.But what it also is doing is creating this massive influx of information on a daily basis, putting enormous pressure on the Department to sort through it, classify it properly, figure out what are the various points of entry because of the cyber-attack risks that these systems have, knowing that our adversaries are constantly trying to hack into these various systems. If you overclassify, then all the advantages of this new information suddenly go away because it's taking too long to process. And so we've been trying to think about this in a smart way. And I think Secretary Kerry has got a range of initiatives to try to get our arms around this. It reflects a larger problem in Government. We just recently, for example\u2014I just recently signed a bill about FOIA requests, Freedom of Information Act requests, that built on a number of reforms that we've put in place. We're processing more Freedom of Information Act requests and doing so faster than ever before. The problem is the volume of requests has skyrocketed. The amount of information that answers the request has multiplied exponentially.So, across Government, you're seeing this problem. And it's a problem in terms of domestic affairs. It becomes an even bigger problem when you're talking about national security issues. So it is something that we're going to have to take care of.With respect to reflections on war, when I came into office, we had 180,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, we have a fraction of that. They are not involved in active combat situations, but are involved in train, advise, and assist situations, other than the direct attacks that we launch against ISIL in conjunction with the Iraq Government and the Syrian Government [partners on the ground in Syria; White House correction.].So, in some ways, Mark, I think you'd recognize that our military operations today in Iraq and Afghanistan are fundamentally different than the wars that we were engaged in when I came into office. But I think you are making an important point, which is when we are dealing with nonstate actors, and those nonstate actors are located in countries with limited capacity, our ultimate goal is to partner with those countries so that they can secure their borders and, themselves, eliminate these terrorist threats.But as we've seen in Afghanistan, for example, that takes some time. The Afghans are fighting. They are much more capable now than they were when I came into office. But they still need support, because it's really tough territory, and it's a really poor country with really low literacy rates and not much experience in things that we take for granted like logistics.And so we have an option of going in, taking out Al aida, pulling out, potentially then seeing a country crumble under the strains of continued terrorist activity or insurgency, and then going back in. Or we can try to maintain a limited partnership that allows them to continue to build their capacity over time and selectively take our own actions against those organizations that we know are trying to attack us or our allies.Because they're nonstate actors, it's very hard for us ever to get the satisfaction of McArthur and the Emperor meeting and a war officially being over. AI was defeated in the sense that we were able to execute a transition to a democratically elected Iraqi Government. But for all of our efforts and the incredible courage and bravery and sacrifice of our troops, the political structure there was still uneven. You had continued Sunni resentments, continued de-Baathification, and as a consequence, those vestiges of AI were able to reconstitute themselves, move into Syria as Syria began to engage in civil war, rebuild, and then come back in.Some have argued that this is the reason why we should have never pulled out of Iraq, or at least, we should have left some larger presence there. Of course, the problem was that we didn't have an Iraqi Government that wanted them, unlike Afghanistan, where we've been invited. And it's very difficult for us to\u2014for me, as Commander in Chief, to want to put our troops in a precarious situation where they're not protected. So I think what we've been trying to do, what I've been trying to do, is to create an architecture, a structure\u2014and it's not there yet\u2014that emphasizes partnerships with countries, emphasizes building up fragile states, resolving internal conflicts wherever we can, trying to do as much as we can through our local partners, preserving the possibility, the necessity to take strikes ourselves against organizations or individuals that we know are trying to kill Americans or Belgians or French or Germans, combine that with much more effective intelligence gathering. But it becomes more of a hybrid approach to national security. And that I do think is probably going to be something that we have to continue to grapple with for years to come.The good news is that there are fewer wars between states than ever before and almost no wars between great powers. And that's a great legacy of leaders in the United States and Europe and Asia, after the cold war\u2014or after the end of World War II that built this international architecture. That's worked. And we should be proud of that and preserve it.But this different kind of low-grade threat, one that's not an existential threat, but can do real damage and real harm to our societies and creates the kind of fear that can cause division and political reactions\u2014we have to do that better. We have to continually refine it.So, for example, the reason that I put out our announcement about the civilian casualties resulting from drone attacks\u2014understanding that there are those who dispute the numbers\u2014what I'm trying to do there is to institutionalize a system where we begin to hold ourselves accountable for this different kind of national security threat and these different kinds of operations.And it's imperfect, still. But I think we can get there. And what I can say honestly is, whether we're talking about how the NSA operates or how drone strikes operate or how we're partnering with other countries or my efforts to close Guantanamo, that by the end of my Presidency\u2014or banning torture\u2014by the end of my Presidency, I feel confident that these efforts will be on a firmer legal footing, more consistent with international law and norms, more reflective of our values and our ethics. But we're going to have more work to do. It's not perfect, and we have to wrestle with these issues all the time.And as Commander in Chief of the most powerful military in the world, I spend a lot of time brooding over these issues. And I'm not satisfied that we've got it perfect yet. I can say honestly, it's better than it was when I came into office.Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Poland.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow do you feel about the fact that last May, you passed a milestone where you became President longer than your predecessor, George W.

Prime Minister, if you would respond in both official languages: Canadians have seen the RCMP visit to your party headquarters, they've heard the allegations from Elections Canada, and they're wondering what's going on. Did you know about this scheme, and will you practice it again in the next election?Prime Minister Harper. Well, this is the same story as before. As you know, Elections Canada view is that some of our local spending should count as national spending. We have a different view. We looked into this at the time, and that's the view we've taken.Our position is always that we always follow the law as we understand it, and, more importantly, we always follow the law as it has been interpreted. We were following, in the last election, the interpretations that had been put on that law in the past. If those interpretations change, we'll, of course, conform, but we will expect the same rules for every single party.[Prime Minister Harper continued in French, and his remarks were translated as follows.]And as I just said, it's always the same thing in this for quite awhile. Elections Canada think that some of our local expenditures should at\u2014should be considered as national expenses. But we do not agree with that, and that's why we went to court with this issue. And in the end, we will respect the law and the interpretations of the law as they are, as we have done in the past.Price of Gasoline/Energy/U.S. Economy Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Oil prices today rose above $118 a barrel. It's another record. Are Saudi Arabia and other oil producers, are they our adversaries, or have you had any success with your recent appeals with them? And also, the effect of the gasoline prices, isn't that about to erase or certainly erode the benefit of the economic stimulus package?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes, no question, rising gasoline prices are like a tax on our working people. And what's happening is, is that we've had an energy policy that neglected hydrocarbons in the United States for a long period of time, and now we're paying the price. We should have been exploring for oil and gas in ANWR, for example. But no, we made the decision: Our Congress kept preventing us from opening up new areas to explore in environmentally friendly ways, and now we're becoming, as a result, more and more dependent on foreign sources of oil. Fortunately, Canada and Mexico are our biggest providers, for which we are grateful. But our energy policy is\u2014 wasn't effective over the past decades, and now we're paying the price.And secondly, there's not a lot of excess capacity in the world. As a matter of fact, unfortunately, a lot of the supplies are coming from parts of the world where there's political instability. Fortunately, again, Canada and Mexico are not included in that group. There are some countries that are not reinvesting in their reserves, which decline without maintenance.And so I'm obviously concerned for our consumers. All the more reason to have passed a rebate, tax relief, and all the more reason for the United States Congress to keep the tax relief I passed permanent. We got people out there campaigning: Well, we're just going to tax the rich. You can't raise enough money to meet their spending appetites by taxing the so-called rich. Every one of those so-called tax-the-rich schemes end up taxing the middle class families. And in a time of economic uncertainty, we need tax certainty. In a time of rising gasoline prices, we need to be sending a message to all Americans: We're not going to raise your taxes.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAre Saudi Arabia and other oil producers our adversaries, or has the President had any success with his recent appeals with them?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

As Islamic State loses territory, you and other officials have said that it is becoming a more traditional terrorist group. Are you satisfied that the United States and its allies have shifted strategy sufficiently to address that change?And secondly, given your comments this week about Donald Trump's volatility and lack of fitness to be President, are you concerned that he will be receiving security briefings about ISIS and other sensitive national security issues?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nOkay. I'm never satisfied with our response, because if you're satisfied that means the problem is solved, and it's not. So we just spent a couple hours meeting with my top national security folks to look at what more can be done.It is absolutely necessary for us to defeat ISIL in Iraq and Syria. It is not sufficient, but it is necessary. Because so long as they have those bases, they can use their propaganda to suggest that somehow there's still some caliphate being born, and that can insinuate itself then in the minds of folks who may be willing to travel there or carry out terrorist attacks. It's also destabilizing for countries in the region at a time when the region is already unstable.So I am pleased with the progress that we've made on the ground in Iraq and Syria. We're far from freeing Mosul and Raqqa. But what we've shown is, is that when it comes to conventional fights, ISIL can be beaten with partners on the ground so long as they've got the support from coalition forces that we've been providing.In the meantime, though, you're seeing ISIL carry out external terrorist acts, and they've learned something they've adapted from Al aida, which had a much more centralized operation and tried to plan very elaborate attacks. And what ISIL has figured out is that if they can convince a handful of people, or even one person, to carry out an attack on a subway or at a parade or some other public venue and kill scores of people, as opposed to thousands of people, it still creates the kinds of fear and concern that elevates their profile.So, in some ways, rooting out these networks for smaller, less complicated attacks is tougher, because it doesn't require as many resources on their part or preparation. But it does mean that we've got to do even more to generate the intelligence and to work with our partners in order to degrade those networks.And the fact is, is that those networks will probably sustain themselves even after ISIL is defeated in Raqqa and Mosul. But what we've learned from our efforts to defeat Al aida is that if we stay on it, our intelligence gets better, and we adapt as well. And eventually, we will dismantle these networks also.This is part of the reason why, however, it is so important for us to keep our eye on the ball and not panic, not succumb to fear. Because ISIL can't defeat the United States of America or our NATO partners. We can defeat ourselves, though, if we make bad decisions. And we have to understand that as painful and as tragic as these attacks are, that we are going to keep on grinding away, preventing them wherever we can, using a whole-of-Government effort to knock down their propaganda, to disrupt their networks, to take their key operatives off the battlefield, and that eventually, we will win.But if we start making bad decisions\u2014indiscriminately killing civilians, for example, in some of these areas, instituting offensive religious tests on who can enter the country\u2014those kinds of strategies can end up backfiring. Because in order for us to ultimately win this fight, we cannot frame this as a clash of civilizations between the West and Islam. That plays exactly into the hands of ISIL and the perversions\u2014the perverse interpretations of Islam that they're putting forward.As far as Mr. Trump, we are going to go by the law, which is that\u2014and in both tradition and the law\u2014that if somebody is the nominee, the Republican nominee for President, they need to get a security briefing so that if they were to win, they are not starting from scratch in terms of being prepared for this office.And I'm not going to go into details of the nature of the security briefings that both candidates receive. What I will say is that they have been told these are classified briefings. And if they want to be President, they've got to start acting like President, and that means being able to receive these briefings and not spread them around.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAre you satisfied that the United States and its allies have shifted strategy sufficiently to address that change?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. You racked up a lot of wins in the last few weeks that a lot of people thought would be difficult to come by. Are you ready to call yourself the comeback kid? And also, as you look ahead to 2011, are you worried that bipartisan agreement will be a lot harder to reach on issues like deficit reduction and maybe even tax reform?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, look, as I said right after the midterm elections, we took a shellacking. And I take responsibility for that. But I think what's happened over the last several weeks is not a victory for me, it's a victory for the American people. And the lesson I hope that everybody takes from this is that it's possible for Democrats and Republicans to have principled disagreements, to have some lengthy arguments, but to ultimately find common ground to move the country forward.That's what we did with taxes. Those arguments have not gone away. I still believe that it doesn't make sense for us to provide tax cuts to people like myself who don't need them when our deficit and debts are growing. That's a debate that's going to continue into 2011, and I know the Republicans feel just as strongly on the other side of that.I think that we're still going to have disagreements in terms of spending priorities. It's vital for us to make investments in education and research and development--all those things that create an innovative economy--while at the same time cutting those programs that just aren't working. And there are going to be debates between the parties on those issues.But what we've shown is that we don't have to agree on a hundred percent to get things done that enhance the lives of families all across America. And if we can sustain that spirit, then regardless of how the politics play out in 2012, the American people will be better for it.

Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for President Macron as well. But if I could to you, sir, first: Your nominee to run the Veterans Affairs Administration, Dr. Ronny Jackson, has run into some serious political headwinds on Capitol Hill with some serious allegations being leveled at him. I'm wondering what you know of those allegations. And do you intend to stand behind him?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I haven't heard of the particular allegations, but I will tell you he's one of the finest people that I have met, and I think speaking for Melania, also. He's been the doctor for President Obama, I believe for President Bush, for me. I've gotten to know him pretty well. He's a great doctor.And it was a suggestion. Now, I know there's an experience problem, because lack of experience. But there's an experience problem\u2014the Veterans Administration is very important to me. We've done a great job with it, as you know, with the Accountability Act and many other things. Now we're working on choice. It's going to happen. We're going to take great care of our veterans. That's a very, very important thing, and we've done a great job.But I told Admiral Jackson just a little while ago, I said, What do you need this for? This is a vicious group of people that malign\u2014and they do. And I've lived through it; we all lived through it. You people are getting record ratings because of it, so congratulations. But I said, What do you need it for? He's an admiral. He's a great leader. And they questioned him about every little thing. As you know, with the success of what will, hopefully, soon be Secretary of State Pompeo, everybody was very surprised. I heard 10 minutes before the vote yesterday on committee that, He will not be approved at committee\u2014which would be the first time in many, many decades that something like that would have happened with regard to a Secretary of State\u2014except I spoke to Rand Paul, and Rand Paul has really never let me down. He\u2014Rand Paul is a good man. And I knew things that nobody else knew. And Rand Paul said, I'm going to change my vote, and he voted, and everybody was surprised. And he actually got an 11-to-9 vote, because as you know, Johnny Isakson's vote counts if it isn't the deciding vote. So it was actually a 11-to-9 with, I believe, an\u2014there was one vote\u2014what would you call that, John?\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDoes the Mr. President intend to stand behind Dr. Ronny Jackson?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you very much. Parwiz Kawa from Kabul-based\u2014[inaudible]\u2014Sobh daily newspaper. President Obama, you're talking about the long-term strategic partnership between Afghanistan and United States. At the same time, you're talking about deadlines about the withdrawal of the soldiers from Afghanistan. How do you ensure the long term\u2014or how do you define the long-term strategy partnership after 2017, or from 2017 onward?[At this point, the reporter spoke in Dari, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.] Q. Mr. President Ghani, I wanted to\u2014what do you expect, Mr. President\u2014what would the expectation coming to the United States and what would you like to return with to Afghanistan?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nOh, no. Please.[.] Our expectations were that our cooperation will be enhanced and we will have a clear vision and practical vision for cooperation\u2014for an enduring cooperation with the United States be there. And this change of environment has occurred, and today, the United States Government and\u2014considers the Government of Afghanistan a really reliable partner.Commitments that are made are considerable, and the funding proposal of supporting Afghan security forces by 2017 and it has reached to $4.1 billion. It's nothing less\u2014it's a significant issue, it's a very important issue.And also, yesterday there was a new framework of our economic cooperation was laid out, according to which $800 million were made\u2014a commitment were made, those will be spent through the Afghan budget. But most importantly is the flexibility that has been shown in the area of security cooperation. And this flexibility is going to ensure and provide confidence to our security forces and our people and also is going to send a very strong message to the region that this cooperation is not short term, but is enduring and long term. . Our strategic partnership is based on a very simple principle. We want the Afghan people, through their security forces directed by their President and Commander in Chief, to be able to provide for their own security. And our goal is to make sure that we are a strong partner in helping to build and sustain effective Afghan security forces.So, from the start, when I first came into office, we put additional U.S. troops, coalition troops, and resources into Afghanistan to shift momentum at a time when the Taliban and the enemies of peace and stability inside of Afghanistan, I think, were moving and had momentum.We broke that momentum, elections took place, and the Afghan National Security Forces began to build up and get trained and become more and more effective. And because of a successful election and a national unity Government and the leadership of President Ghani and Dr. Abdullah, we are now in a position where the Afghan security forces are not only more effective, but they're also better directed by the civilian Government.We've been able to draw down and remove ourselves from a combat role, as doctor\u2014as President Ghani indicated, without collapse, as was predicted. And Afghan soldiers have fought, and they've fought well. And obviously, there are still improvements to be made, but they're making significant progress.So the strategic partnership involves us continuing to help support Afghan security forces. That means financially. The international community is going to have to continue to provide assistance to the Afghan Government, which is carrying a significant security load not only for itself, but for the region and, in some ways, the world. And we've made a commitment to do that.We're going to continue to provide the kind of security cooperation and support that is required\u2014training, assisting, advising, helping on logistics, helping on developing enabler capacity\u2014all the things that go into a modern military, a professional military, a professional police force that can provide security on Afghan soil by Afghans.And the cooperation and the strategic partnership involves building up the prosperity and opportunities for the Afghan people through the economic development that was mentioned by the President.So we intend to be working with the Afghan Government and the Afghan people for a long time. And in many ways, our troop presence, our military assistance is just one component of what is a much larger process. And the more successful we are in building Afghan capacity and strengthening the Afghan economy, the more the strategic partnership that we have will be like the partnership that we have with many countries around the world. And it will be based on mutual interest and scientific and educational exchanges and business opportunities and commerce and trade. And that, I think, is the goal that we're all looking for.Josh Lederman [Associated Press].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat would you like to return with to Afghanistan?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Do you think Occupy Wall Street has the potential to be a Tea Party movement in 2012?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWhat I think is that the American people understand that not everybody has been following the rules, that Wall Street is an example of that, that folks who are working hard every single day, getting up, going to the job, loyal to their companies, that that used to be the essence of the American Dream. That's how you got ahead--the old-fashioned way. And these days, a lot of folks who are doing the right thing aren't rewarded, and a lot of folks who aren't doing the right thing are rewarded.And that's going to express itself politically in 2012 and beyond until people feel like once again we're getting back to some old-fashioned American values in which, if you're a banker, then you are making your money by making prudent loans to businesses and individuals to build plants and equipment and hire workers that are creating goods and products that are building the economy and benefiting everybody.Jake Tapper [ABC News].//Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives Fast and Furious Program\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo you think Occupy Wall Street has the potential to be a Tea Party movement in 2012?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. Everything you have talked about--tax reform, the entitlement reform, two parties coming together--just happened in December in your fiscal commission. You had a majority consensus to do all this. It's now been shelved. It seems that you have not taken--I guess my question is what was the point of the fiscal commission? If you have this moment where you had Tom Coburn, your conservative friend in the United States Senate, sign on to this deal; Judd Gregg was also on this thing; you had Dick Durbin, your good friend from Illinois, Democrat--everything you just described in the answer to Chip and the answer to Ben just happened. Why not grab it?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThe notion that it has been shelved, I think, is incorrect. It still provides a framework for a conversation.Part of the challenge here is that this town, let's face it, you guys are pretty impatient. If something doesn't happen today, then the assumption is it's just not going to happen, right? I've had this conversation for that last 2 years about every single issue that we worked on, whether it was health care or don't ask, don't tell, on Egypt, right? We've had this monumental change over the last 3 weeks, well, why did it take 3 weeks? [] So I think that there's a tendency for us to assume that if it didn't happen today, it's not going to happen.Well, the fiscal commission put out a framework. I agree with much of the framework; I disagree with some of the framework. It is true that it got 11 votes, and that was a positive sign. What's also true is, for example, is, is that the chairman of the House Republican budgeteers didn't sign on. He's got a little bit of juice when it comes to trying to get an eventual budget done. So he's got concerns. So I'm going to have to have a conversation with him, what would he like to see happen.I'm going to have to have a conversation with those Democrats who didn't vote for it. There are some issues in there that, as a matter of principle, I don't agree with, where I think they didn't go far enough, or they went too far. So this is going to be a process in which each side, both in--in both Chambers of Congress, go back and forth and start trying to whittle their differences down until we arrive at something that has an actual chance of passage.And that's my goal. I mean, my goal here is to actually solve the problem. It's not to get a good headline on the first day. My goal is, is that a year from now or 2 years from now, people look back and say, you know what, we actually started making progress on this issue.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat was the point of the fiscal commission?

When you meet with President Xi Jinping of China, will you tell him that you're committed to defending Taiwan militarily? And what are you hoping to get out of this meeting that will make it a success? Are you willing to make any concessions to him?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, look, I'm not making\u2014I'm not willing to make any fundamental concessions because what I\u2014what I've told him in the beginning\u2014and this is\u2014we've\u2014I've spent over 78, I think they told me, hours with him so far\u201467 in person, when I was Vice President. President Obama knew he couldn't spend time with the Vice President of another country, so I traveled 17,000 miles with them in China and around\u2014and the United States. I've met with him many times.And I've told him: I'm looking for competition, not conflict. And so what I want to do with him when we talk is lay out what the\u2014what kind of\u2014what each of our red lines are, understand what he believes to be in the critical national interests of China, what I know to be the critical interests of the United States, and to determine whether or not they conflict with one another.

So I'm sure we'll discuss China, the\u2014excuse me, Taiwan. And I'm sure we'll discuss a number of other issues, including fair trade and relationships relating to his relationship with other countries in the region.And so, at any rate\u2014so there's a lot we're going to have to discuss.Do you want another question?\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat are you hoping to get out of this meeting that will make it a success?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Well, we try to be precise. [Laughter] So on Libya, when you say that you will be transferring command, when are you thinking of transferring command? And would NATO be the preferred partner to take over that command? And the second part of the question is that you have said that you want an alliance among equals with the peoples of the Americas. What deliverables are you going to go for after this trip to achieve it?And----[The reporter asked a question in Spanish, which was translated by an interpreter as follows.] Q. ----President Pinera, what is the content of this partnership so as to meet the goals of the region?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, with respect to Libya, obviously the situation is evolving on the ground. And how quickly this transfer takes place will be determined by the recommendations of our commanding officers that the mission has been completed--the first phase of the mission has been completed.As I said, our initial focus is taking out Libyan air defenses so that a no-fly zone can operate effectively and aircraft and pilots of the coalition are not threatened when they're maintaining the no-fly zone. The second aspect of this is making sure that the humanitarian aspects of the mission can be met.But let me emphasize that we anticipate this transition to take place in a matter of days and not a matter of weeks. And so I would expect that over the next several days, we'll have more information, and the Pentagon will be fully briefing the American people as well as the press on that issue.NATO will be involved in a coordinating function because of the extraordinary capacity of that alliance. But I will leave it to Admiral Mullen and those who are directly involved in the operation to describe to you how exactly that transfer might be--might take place.With respect to this new partnership, I don't want to give you all my best lines from my speech; otherwise, no one will come. [] But the thing that I'm most excited about is the fact that in a country like Chile, it's not just a matter of what we can give to Chile, it's also a matter of what Chile can offer us.Chile has done some very interesting work around clean energy, so we set up a clean energy partnership. We think we're doing terrific work on alternative energy sources, but there may be initiatives that are taking place here in Chile that might be transferrable to the United States.On education, obviously, we have a long history of public education, and our universities, I think, are second to none. But we want to make sure that in this increasingly integrated world, American students aren't just looking inwards, we're also looking outwards. And so the idea of us setting up a broad-based exchange program with the Americas, I think, makes an enormous difference.Security cooperation: The plague of narcotraffickers in the region is something that we're all too familiar with. And obviously, we have the example of Colombia that has made great strides in bringing security to a country that had been ravaged by drug wars. What lessons can we take and then apply them to smaller countries in Central America, for example, that are going through some of these same struggles?For Chile, the United States, Colombia, other countries to work in concert to help to train effective security operations in Central America to deal with narcotraffickers is a kind of collaboration that would not be as effective if the United States were operating on its own.So I think across the spectrum of issues that we care about deeply and that Chile care about deeply, what will characterize this new partnership is the fact that it's a two-way street. This is not just a situation where a highly developed country is helping a poor and impoverished country; this is a situation where an up-and-coming regional power that has a strong voice in international affairs is now collaborating with us to, hopefully, help greater peace and prosperity for the region and the world. . No doubt that insofar as integration of the Americas, we are lagging behind. And the best way to illustrate this is to compare what has happened in America with what happened in Europe.Last century, the Europeans had two World Wars that--with a toll of more than 70 million casualties. But at some point, they had the wisdom, the courage to abandon the rationale of Line Maginot or Siegfried Line and to embrace Maastricht Treaty. With the leadership and the vision of such renowned statesmen like Adenauer, De Gasperi, Haussmann, Schuman, they began to build what today we know of as European Union.And in America, we are much behind that. In America, 20 years ago, President Bush, father, raised the idea of a free trade area from Alaska to Fire Land [Tierra del Fuego]*, generating a lot of enthusiasm in the region, but it never came true, never materialized.And so the time is right now because Latin America has been for too long the continent of hope or of the future, but a continent cannot be a promise forever. And so we are of age now, and we need to fulfill our mission. Therefore, the main task of Latin America is to recover the lost time and tap all of its potential.We have lots of things in common with the U.S.: vast, generous territory, homogenous peoples, hard-working people. We don't have racial problems that affect some African countries or the wars that raged in Europe, nor the religious conflicts of Europe itself. And therefore Latin America is called to compromise, or rather commitment with its own fate.And therefore, we are looking forward to 's words. We are all left-handed--we have many coincidences--we studied in Harvard, both of us. We are sportsmen. continues to be a basketball player; I was in my time as well. I think the First Lady of the U.S. is very good-looking, and has said the same about the First Lady of Chile. There are plenty of coincidences, but the most important one is the one we'll find this afternoon.And modestly, if I could suggest to , we hope to have a partnership that is 2.0, a one where we have all responsibilities and not an existential alliance, because existentialism has never been enough to face the major problems, but rather, a partnership of collaboration between Latin America and the United States sharing values, principles, and a common vision.And that alliance should be comprehensive. It should reach out to the fields of democracy, freedom, rule of law, defense of human rights. And I think that we have to improve the democratic charter of OAS. It should also open up the doors to the free trade of goods and services, and faster than what we have done hitherto. And in addition to that, to include those subjects which are the true pillars of the 21st century: quality of education, science, technology, innovation, entrepreneurship. Therein lie the pillars for Latin America so as to leave poverty and antidevelopment behind.And we have so much to learn from a country like the United States that, in its 230 years of independent life, has really gave--has given true evidence of being an innovative country and that has made the largest contribution to progress of mankind.And thus, Latin America and the United States have a lot to gain from this alliance, but also has to reach out to two of the most important challenges of the 21st century: energy, to have clean, safe renewable energies; and water--if global warming keeps on going, could be the most scarce resource of our century. And also face the major problems of modern society that cannot be faced unilaterally: organized crime, terrorism, drug trafficking, global warming, the subject of world security. It can no longer be faced individually. We need to work jointly together.And in our view, that will call for a new international order that will replace that which emerged in Bretton Woods after the Second World War and to be appropriate and adaptive to the needs and challenges of the 21st century, where the only constant thing we have is change.So the time is right to recover all that lost time. And the time is here so that finally, this relationship of encounters, disencounters--of shaking hands or our backs--for that to be in the past. And let us initiate a new era of collaboration, reencountering frankly, effectively, concretely, that will truly face and solve the major problems; that will also open up the doors to tap the main opportunities. This society of knowledge and information is knocking on our doors.Latin America was late to the Industrial Revolution. We cannot be late in this tremendous revolution, which is so much deeper, which is that of knowledge and information. And it has been very generous with the countries that want to embrace it, but very cool with those countries that do not tap it.No child should be left behind; I've heard this from . And here, we say in Latin America, no country should be left behind.Thank you.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWould NATO be the preferred partner to take over that command?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Good morning, Your Excellencies. My question is to President Bush. Looking at Africa from afar, things might look bleak, but all may not be lost yet. A new Africa is emerging. But in your candid view, what do you think Africa must do, and what kind of leadership do you expect to see in Africa? And how will the U.S. help in this regard, to push forward the agenda to transform the continent into a better place for its people?And secondly, what do you hope to achieve from your five-nation tour, and why have you decided to visit Africa on the last lap of your term? And how do you want to ensure continuity in whatever you hope to achieve?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThanks. I actually went to Africa on the first lap of my Presidency too. This is my second trip to the continent of Africa, and I've come to remind our fellow citizens that it is in our interest to help countries deal with curable diseases like malaria and difficult diseases like HIV/ AIDS; that it's in our interest to promote trade between the continent of Africa and the United States of America; that it's in our interest to provide education money so governments will educate children.And there's no better way of making that point than to be in Ghana, where people will get to see firsthand what I'm talking about. It's one thing to be giving speeches in America, it's another thing to actually come to Ghana and meet different folks that are involved with making the\u2014Ghana a better place.Secondly, first of all, Africa has changed since I've been the President, in a very positive way. It's not because of me; it's because of African leaders\u2014I want you to know. But there was six regional conflicts when I became the President. Take Liberia, for example. It was a real issue and a real problem, and along with Nigeria and with John's advice, for example, we\u2014I made some decisions, along with other leaders, that helped put in place the first democratically elected woman on the continent's history. And I'm going there tomorrow to herald the successes she's done and to reaffirm our commitment that we'll help.In other words, conflict resolution has been taking place. And the United States hasn't tried to impose a will. We've just tried to be a useful partner, like in eastern Congo, for example, working with the Presidents of Rwanda and Congo and Burundi.Secondly, democracy is making progress across the continent of Africa. One reason why is because there are examples like John Kufuor for people to look at. I'm telling you, the guy is a respected person. People look at him, and they say, this is the kind of leader that we respect.And thirdly, our aid program has changed from one that basically said, here's your money, good luck, to one that said, in return for generosity, we expect there to be certain habits in place, like fighting corruption or investing in the education of children. I don't think that's too much to ask in return for U.S. taxpayers' money. It hasn't been asked in the past. This is a novel approach, interestingly enough. But I feel confident in asking nations to adhere to good principles because I believe in setting high standards for African leaders.I'm confident in the capacity of the leaders I have met\u2014not every single leader\u2014 but on this trip, the leaders I'm with are leaders who have committed themselves to the good of their people, have committed themselves to honest government, have committed themselves to investing in people. They're more interested in leaving behind a legacy of education than leaving behind fancy\u2014a self-serving government. And there's no better way of making that point than coming to the continent. And that's why I'm here, and I'm glad I am here. It's been a great trip, and it's\u2014and I appreciate the hospitality of my friend, and so does Laura.Let's see here, John McKinnon. He would be from your Wall Street Journal. Yes, that's a pretty sophisticated paper, no question about that.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow will the U.S. help in pushing forward the agenda to transform the continent?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

And a subsidiary question, what do you think about taking it out of the political realm and giving it to an outside body of experts to take the politics out of Medicare?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, on the second point, that's exactly what our proposal is. It\u2014called the MedPAC program. By the way, it was originally a Republican idea. I want to give credit where credit is due. The Republican Congress passed a bill that created a panel of health care experts to make recommendations to Congress on how we could get better quality, lower cost. The problem is, every year it would just go on a shelf and nobody would act on it.So what we've said is let's give that body some power. Let's require Congress to vote on the proposals that they're making every year. Congress can still reject them, so it's not completely removing it from politics, but they have to reject or accept it as a package. And that, I think, would incentivize and empower important changes.But here's the thing I want to emphasize, Chip. It's not going to reduce benefits. What it's going to do is to change how those benefits are delivered so that they're more efficient. Let me give you a very specific example. You've heard that as a consequence of our efforts at reform, the pharmaceutical industry has already said they're willing to put $80 billion on the table. Now, why is that? Well, the reason is, is because there's probably even more waste than $80 billion, in terms of how the drug plan in is administered. We might be able to get 100 billion out or more, but the pharmaceutical industry voluntarily said here's $80 billion.You know what that translates\u2014what that means? That means that senior citizens who right now have a so-called doughnut hole in their plan, where after spending a certain amount on prescription drugs suddenly they drop off a cliff and they've got to pocket the entire cost, suddenly half of that is filled. That's a hard commitment that we already have. So that's a change in how we are delivering . But you know what? It turns out that it means out-of-pocket savings for seniors. That's why AARP has endorsed us. Okay.Christi Parsons [Chicago Tribune].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nSubsidiary question on taking Medicare out of the political realm: What do you think about taking it out of the political realm?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. On Aleppo, your views that what happens there is the responsibility of the Russian Government, the Iranian Government, the Asad regime have been pretty well aired. But do you, as President of the United States, leader of the free world, feel any personal, moral responsibility now at the end of your Presidency for the carnage that we're all watching in Aleppo, which I'm sure disturbs you, which you said disturbs you?Secondly, also on Aleppo, you've again made clear your practical disagreements with the idea of safe zones. And President-elect Trump has, throughout his campaign\u2014and he said again last night\u2014that he wants to create safe zones in Syria. Do you feel like, in this transition, you need to help him toward implementing that? Or was that not something that you should be doing?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nGood. Mike, I always feel responsible. I've felt responsible when kids were being shot by snipers. I felt responsible when millions of people had been displaced. I feel responsible for murder and s that's taken place in South Sudan that's not being reported on partly because there's not as much social media being generated from there.There are places around the world where horrible things are happening, and because of my office, because I'm President of the United States, I feel responsible. I ask myself every single day, is there something I could do that would save lives and make a difference and spare some child who doesn't deserve to suffer. So that's a starting point. There's not a moment during the course of this Presidency where I haven't felt some responsibility. That's true, by the way, for our own country. When I came into office and people were losing their jobs and losing their homes and losing their pensions, I felt responsible, and I would go home at night, and I would ask myself, was there something better that I could do or smarter that I could be that would make a difference in their lives, that would relieve their suffering and relieve their hardship?So, with respect to Syria, what I have consistently done is taken the best course that I can to try to end the civil war while having also to take into account the long-term national security interests of the United States.And throughout this process, based on hours of meetings\u2014if you tallied it up, days or weeks of meetings where we went through every option in painful detail, with maps, and we had our military, and we had our aid agencies, and we had our diplomatic teams, and sometimes, we'd bring in outsiders who were critics of ours\u2014whenever we went through it, the challenge was that, short of putting large numbers of U.S. troops on the ground, uninvited, without any international law mandate, without sufficient support from Congress, at a time when we still had troops in Afghanistan and we still had troops in Iraq and we had just gone through over a decade of war and spent trillions of dollars, and when the opposition on the ground was not cohesive enough to necessarily govern a country, and you had a military superpower in Russia prepared to do whatever it took to keep its client state involved, and you had a regional military power in Iran that saw their own vital strategic interests at stake and were willing to send in as many of their people or proxies to support the regime\u2014that in that circumstance, unless we were all in and willing to take over Syria, we were going to have problems, and that everything else was tempting because we wanted to do something and it sounded like the right thing to do, but it was going to be impossible to do this on the cheap.And in that circumstance, I have to make a decision as President of the United States as to what is best\u2014\u2014[] . I'm sorry, what's going on?\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nPersonal, moral responsibility for the situation in Aleppo\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. I know some of my colleagues will get into some specific issues, but I wanted to zoom out on your first year in office.Inflation is up. Your signature domestic legislation is stalled in Congress. In a few hours from now, the Senate\u2014an effort in the Senate to deal with voting rights and voting\u2014voting reform legislation is going to fail. COVID-19 is taking the lives of 1,500 Americans every day. And the Nation's divisions are just as raw as they were a year ago. Did you overpromise to the American public what you could achieve in your first year in office? And how do you plan to course-correct going forward?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWhy are you such an optimist? []Look, I didn't overpromise, and\u2014but I have probably outperformed what anybody thought would happen. The fact of the matter is that we're in a situation where we have made enormous progress. You mentioned the number of deaths from COVID; well, it was three times that not long ago. It's coming down. Everything is changing. It's getting better.Look, I didn't overpromise, but I think if you take a look at what we've been able to do, you'd have to acknowledge we made enormous progress.But one of the things that I think is something that\u2014one thing I haven't been able to do so far is get my Republican friends to get in the game of making things better in this country. For example, I was reading the other day\u2014and I wrote the quote down so I don't misquote him\u2014a quote from Senator Sununu, when he decided that he wasn't going to\u2014excuse me, Governor Sununu\u2014when he decided he wasn't going to run for the Senate in New Hampshire.Here's what he said: They were all, for the most\u2014quote\u2014They were all, for the most part, content with the speed at which they weren't doing anything. It was very clear that we just had to hold the line for 2 years. Okay, so I'm just going to be a roadblock for the next 2 years? That's not what I do, Sununu said.He went on to say, It bothered me that they were okay with that. And then he goes on to say, I said, okay, so we're not going to get stuff done if we win the White House back\u2014if we win the White House back. Why didn't [we] do [anything] in 2017 and 2018? And then, he said\u2014how did the Republicans Sununu spoke to answer the challenge? He said: Crickets. Yes, crickets. They had no answer.I did not anticipate that there'd be such a stalwart effort to make sure that the most important thing was that President Biden didn't get anything done. Think about this: What are Republicans for? What are they for? Name me one thing they're for.And so the problem here is that I think what happens\u2014what I have to do, and the change in tactic, if you will: I have to make clear to the American people what we are for. We've passed a lot. We've passed a lot of things that people don't even understand what's all that's in it, understandably.Remember when we passed the Affordable Care Act and everybody thought that\u2014you know, and it really was getting pummeled and beaten? And it wasn't until after you're out of office, and that next campaign when\u2014that off-year campaign. And I went into a whole\u2014I wasn't in office anymore. We were in a whole bunch of districts campaigning for Democrats in Republican districts who said they wanted to do away with health care, with Obamacare.And I started pointing out that if you did that, preexisting conditions would no longer be covered. And they said: Huh? We didn't know that. We didn't know that. And guess what? We won over 38 seats because we explained to the people exactly what, in fact, had passed.And one of the things that I remember saying\u2014and I'll end this\u2014I remember saying to President Obama, when he passed the Affordable Care Act\u2014I said, You ought to take a victory lap. And he said, There's so many things going on, we have don't have time to take a victory lap.As a consequence, no one knew what the detail of the legislation was. They don't know a lot of the detail of what we passed. So the difference is, I'm going to be out on the road a lot, making the case around the country, with my colleagues who are up for reelection and others, making the case of what we did do and what we want to do, what we need to do.And so I don't think I've overpromised at all. And I'm going to stay on this track.You know, one of the things that I remember\u2014and I'll end this with\u2014I was talking with, you know, Jim Clyburn, who was a great help to me in the campaign in South Carolina. And Jim said\u2014and when he would endorse me\u2014and there was a clip on television the last couple days of Jim. And it said that we want to make things accessible and affordable for all Americans. That's health care, that's education, that's prescription drugs, that's making sure you have access\u2014access\u2014to all the things that everybody else has. We can afford to do that. We can't afford not to do it.So I tell my Republican friends: Here I come. This is going to be about, What are you for?\u2014What are you for?\u2014and lay out what we're for.Mary Bruce, ABC.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow do you plan to course-correct going forward?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Mr. President, yesterday you discussed Usama bin Laden's plans to turn Iraq into a terrorist sanctuary.

Why is he so hard to catch?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI would say that 5 years ago\u2014like I said, we're going to pursue him. And we are pursuing him. And he's hiding. He is in a remote region of the world. If I knew precisely where he is, we would take the appropriate action to bring him to justice. He is attempting to establish a base of operations in Iraq. He hasn't established a base in operations. My points yesterday were, here was his intentions, but thankfully, of the three people I named, all of them no longer are a part of his operation.My point is, is that\u2014I was making the point, Jim, as I'm sure you recognized, that if we leave, they follow us. And my point was, was that Usama bin Laden was establishing an external cell there, or trying to. And he's been unable to do it, precisely my point. That's why we've got to stay engaged. Had he been able to establish an internal cell that had safe haven, we would be a lot more in danger today than we are. His organization is a risk. We will continue to pursue as hard as we possibly can. We will do everything we can to bring him and others to justice.We have had good success in the chief operating officer position of Al Qaida. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Ramzi al Rabium\u2014there's a lot of names that I\u2014 some of whom I mentioned yesterday, that are no longer a threat to the United States. We will continue to work to bring him to justice; that's exactly what the American people expect us to do, and, in the meantime, use the tools we put in place to protect this homeland.We are under threat. Now, some may say, well, he's just saying that to get people to pay attention to him, or try to scare them into\u2014for some reason. I would hope our world hadn't become so cynical that they don't take the threats of Al Qaida seriously, because they're real. And it's a danger to the American people. It's a danger to your children, Jim. And it's really important that we do all we can do to bring them to justice.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat do you think your own reaction would have been 5 years ago had you been told that towards the end of your term, Usama bin Laden would still be at large with that kind of capability from Iraq?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. Some on Wall Street have expressed frustration that it's unclear what more your administration is willing to do to resolve the banking crisis. The markets have remained in turmoil. So how confident are you that the problem is contained? And if it spreads, what measures, such as guaranteeing more deposits, are you willing or not willing to take?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nFirst of all, have you ever known Wall Street not in consternation? Number one.Look, I think we've done a pretty damn good job. People's savings are secure, and even those beyond the $250,000 the FDIC is guaranteeing them. And the American taxpayer is not going to have to pay a penny. The banks are in pretty good shape. What's going on in Europe isn't a direct consequence of what's happening in the United States.And I\u2014what we would do is, if we find that there's more instability than appears, we'd be in a position to have the FDIC use the power it has to guarantee those loans above 250, like they did already.And so I think it's going to take a little while for things to just calm down. But I don't see anything that's on the horizon that's about to explode. But I do understand there's an unease about this. And these mid-sized banks have to be able to survive, and I think they'll be able to do that.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow confident are you that the problem is contained?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Right? President Erdogan. He's tough but I get along with him. And maybe that's a bad thing but I think it's a really good thing. Because frankly he wanted to wipe out\u2014he has a big problem with the Kurds as everyone knows. And he had a 65000-man army at the border and he was going to wipe out the Kurds who helped us with ISIS. We took out the caliphate. We have a hundred percent of the caliphate.And I called him and I asked him not to do it. They are I guess natural enemies of his or Turkey's. And he hasn't done it. He had\u2014they were lined up to go out and wipe out the people that we just defeated the ISIS caliphate with and I said You can't do that. You can't do it. And he didn't do it.So I have a relationship. But let me tell you\u2014so he goes out during the Obama administration; he wants to buy our Patriot missile. Right? They wouldn't sell it to him. He wants to buy\u2014even though he's a member of NATO and in theory he could be an ally if he respected the President. He\u2014and he's got a big army and he's\u2014you know they're fighters. Turkey is\u2014big fighters. And we're working on Idlib Province together because he doesn't want to see 3 million people killed and neither do I\u2014in Syria. But\u2014and I mentioned that. That was another thing I mentioned folks to President Putin. I said Please take it easy with Idlib. Because you know they've been encircling that.I think if I didn't put out a statement 6 months ago that would've been catastrophic. But they have 30000 terrorists in Idlib Province. You have 3 million people. And you know getting terrorists is okay but you don't want to kill 3 million people or a million people to get the terrorists.So anyway\u2014so we get along great. But what happened with Turkey\u2014and I will tell you when it's fair and when it's not fair. He wanted to buy the Patriot missile. President Obama's group said no. He kept wanting to buy it. They kept saying no no no. Couldn't buy it. Now he needed it for defense. He needed it. So he then went to Russia and he bought the S-400. Made a deal to buy it because he couldn't get it. They wouldn't allow him to buy it. They wouldn't allow it. This administration meaning this administration previous to mine would not let him buy it.So he goes out he goes to Russia and he makes a deal for the S-400. And let's assume it's not nearly as good but he made a deal. He paid them money a lot of money. Put up a lot of money. And he bought it. As soon as he bought it people went back to him from our country and they said Listen we don't want you to use that system because it's not the NATO system et cetera et cetera\u2014you know all the reasons: We don't want you to use that system. Do us a favor we'll sell you the Patriot. He said It's too late. I already bought it. There was nothing he could do; he already bought it.In the meantime he bought over a hundred F-35s the greatest fighter jet in the world. It's stealth. You can't see it. It's real hard to beat something when you can't see it. But he bought over a hundred. I think he bought 116. But he bought over a hundred. A lot. And he has options for more. And now he wants delivery. He's paid a tremendous amount of money up front to Lockheed our company our jobs everything. And now they're saying he's using the S-400 system which is incompatible with our system and if you use the S-400 system Russia and other people can gain access into the genius of the F-35.But honestly I'm all for our country but he got treated very unfairly. He was told you can't buy it you can't buy it. You know it's the old secret when you can't have something all of a sudden he ends up going and getting something else and then they were\u2014they said\u2014first they said: We'll sell it to you. You can have it in 4 years. Then they said We'll get it to you immediately. But he said: I can't do it. I bought. I've spent a fortune on buying another system\u2014similar system\u2014from Russia. The problem is he already bought the planes. And the planes aren't compatible from our standpoint. Not from the standpoint of compatibility but from our standpoint national security wise.So it's a mess. It's a mess. And honestly it's not really Erdogan's fault. So now we have breaking news.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWill Turkey face sanctions if it goes ahead with the S-400 purchases?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Mr. President, dozens of American troops have been killed this month, and sectarian violence appears to be rising again in Iraq. And you yourself just said that you're expecting more casualties in the weeks and months ahead. How much longer do you believe you can sustain your current policy in Iraq without significant progress on the ground? And how confident are you about finding those missing soldiers?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI'm confident that the military is doing everything it can to find the missing soldiers. I talked to General Petraeus about this subject and Secretary Gates. And General Petraeus informs him that we're using all the intelligence and all the troops we can find\u2014to find them. It's a top priority of our people there in Iraq.Obviously, the loss of life is\u2014it is devastating to families. I fully understand that. But I want to remind you as to why I sent more troops in. It was to help stabilize the capital. You're asking me, How much longer? We have yet to even get all our troops in place. General David Petraeus laid out a plan for the Congress. He talked about a strategy all aiming\u2014all aimed at helping this Iraqi Government secure its capital so that they can do the\u2014some of the political work necessary, the hard work necessary to reconcile.And as I explained in my opening remarks, all the troops won't be there until mid-June. And one reason you're seeing more fighting is because our troops are going into new areas, along with the Iraqis. And so General Petraeus has said, Why don't you give us until September, and let me report back, to not only me but to the United States Congress, about progress?I would like to see us in a different configuration at some point in time in Iraq. However, it's going to require taking control of the capital. And the best way to do that was to follow the recommendations of General Petraeus. As I have constantly made clear, the recommendations of Baker-Hamilton appeal to me, and that is to be embedded and to train and to guard the territorial integrity of the country and to have Special Forces to chase down Al Qaida. But I didn't think we could get there unless we increased the troop levels to secure the capital. I was fearful that violence would spiral out of control in Iraq and that this experience of trying to help this democracy would\u2014couldn't succeed.And so therefore, the decisions I made are all aimed at getting us to a different position; and the timing of which will be decided by the commanders on the ground, not politicians here in Washington.Chen [Edwin Chen, Los Angeles Times]. Ed, excuse me. That's Henry [Ed Henry, Cable News Network]. Chen. Yes, you're coming down there; no, sorry. Work the print people a little bit, see. I've got the strategy: print.

Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned your progress on COVID-19. I'd like to ask you about some of the other issues facing your Presidency. One of the defining challenges you face in the coming months is how to deliver on your promise to Americans on issues like immigration reform, gun control, voting rights, climate change. All of those right now are facing stiff, united opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill. How far are you willing to go to achieve those promises that you made to the American people?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I'm going to\u2014look, when I took office, I decided that it was a fairly basic, simple proposition, and that is: I got elected to solve problems. And the most urgent problem facing the American people, I stated from the outset, was COVID-19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of Americans. And so that's why I put all my focus in the beginning\u2014there are a lot of problems\u2014put all my focus on dealing with those particular problems.And the other problems we're talking about, from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned, are long-term problems; they've been around a long time. And what we're going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well, and\u2014whether it's immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country.But the fundamental problem is getting people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling wondering whether they lost their health insurance, whether they're going to lose a family member, whether they're going to be in a position where they're not going to be\u2014they're going to lose their home because they can't pay their mortgage, or that millions of people are going to get thrown out of their homes because of the inability to pay their rent.So we're going to move on these one at a time, try to do as many simultaneously as we can. But that's the reason why I focused as I have.And here's the deal: I think my Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together, or they decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to just decide to divide the country, continue the politics of division. But I'm not going to do that; I'm just going to move forward and take these things as they come.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow far are you willing to go to achieve those promises that you made to the American people?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

How did it go down?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nAnd no subsidies. I even said no tariffs. In other words, let's say Canada\u2014where we have tremendous tariffs\u2014the United States pays tremendous tariffs on dairy. As an example, 270 percent. Nobody knows that. We pay nothing. We don't want to pay anything. Why should we pay?We have to\u2014ultimately, that's what you want. You want a tariff-free, you want no barriers, and you want no subsidies, because you have some cases where countries are subsidizing industries, and that's not fair. So you go tariff-free, you go barrier-free, you go subsidy-free. That's the way you learned at the Wharton School of Finance. I mean, that would be the ultimate thing. Now, whether or not that works\u2014but I did suggest it, and people were\u2014I guess, they're going to go back to the drawing and check it out, right?But we can't have\u2014an example\u2014where we're paying\u2014the United States is paying 270 percent. Just can't have it. And when they send things into us, you don't have that. I will say, it was not contentious. What was strong was the language that this cannot go on. But the relationships are very good, whether it be President Macron or with Justin. We had\u2014Justin did a really good job. I think the relationships were outstanding.But because of the fact that the United States leaders of the past didn't do a good job on trade\u2014and again, I'm not blaming countries, I'm blaming our people that represented our past. It's got to change. It's going to change. I mean, it's not a question of I hope it changes. It's going to change, a hundred percent. And tariffs are going to come way down, because we\u2014people cannot continue to do that. We're like the piggybank that everybody is robbing. And that ends.In fact, Larry Kudlow is a great expert on this, and he's a total free trader. But even Larry has seen the ravages of what they've done with their tariffs. Would you like to say something on that, Larry, very quickly? It might be interesting. One interesting point, in terms of the G-7 group meeting\u2014I don't know if they were surprised with President Trump's free-trade proclamation, but they certainly listened to it and we had lengthy discussions about that. As the President said, all\u2014reduce these barriers. In fact, go to zero: zero tariffs, zero nontariff barriers, zero subsidies.And along the way, we're going to have to clean up the international trading system about which there was virtual consensus of agreement on that. And that will be a target. And these are the best ways to promote economic growth, and we'll all be better at it, and we'll all be stronger at it. So, I myself was particularly gratified to hear my President talk about free trade. Thank you, sir. . Thank you.And it's very unfair to our farmers. Our farmers are, essentially\u2014whether it's through a barrier, nonmonetary barrier, or whether it's through very high tariffs that make it impossible\u2014and this is all over the world. This isn't just G-7. I mean, we have India, where some of the tariffs are a hundred percent. A hundred percent. And we charge nothing. We can't do that. And so we are talking to many countries. We're talking to all countries. And it's going to stop. Or we'll stop trading with them. And that's a very profitable answer, if we have to do it.Yes, sir.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow did it go down?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

So I'm very proud of him.All right?\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo you want to say anything about Jason Collins?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

President Bush, in your assessment, what, if anything, was accomplished at the Baghdad regional conference? And what are your expectations for future rounds? Also, do you take\u2014do you believe that Iran and Syria were serious in their post-conference statements that they want to help stabilize Iraq? And if that is true, do you see a possibility of opening the way towards more formal direct contacts with those two countries?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI'm the kind of person that likes people to say something and then do it; then we'll react. Words are easy to say in politics, in the international diplomacy. If they really want to help stabilize Iraq, there are things for them to do, such as cutting off weapon flows and/or the flow of suicide bombers into Iraq. There's all kind of ways to measure whether they're serious about the words they uttered. We, of course, welcome those words. Those are nice statements. And now they can act on them.I thought the conference\u2014well, first of all, I thought the conference got people in the neighborhood to say positive things about the young democracy. In other words, people are now committed publicly to helping Iraq, which was, I thought, very positive. I think the other benefit from the conference is, is that the government gained some confidence. In other words, this young democracy had nations from around the neighborhood and around the world come and talk to them in a way that was constructive and positive.Part of the success in Iraq is going to be whether or not this government has got the confidence necessary to make hard decisions. They're learning what democracy is all about. They've come from a tyranny to democracy in a pretty quick period of time. And I believe the conference will give the different factions inside Iraq the confidence necessary to do the hard things to reconcile and the government the confidence necessary to make the decision so that reconciliation can happen.So it was a positive outcome. And in terms of the expectations of the next meetings, we'll see. But the point is, is that the momentum made in the first one can be carried over to the second one. Secretary Rice will be going to that meeting. In other words, it's a step up in\u2014I'm not dissing anybody, but it's a step up in the pay grade; let's put it that way. [] And I think\u2014and I think Condi is going to\u2014will take an agenda that will help advance this young democracy, and she's going to work with the other nations to do so.. Gracias, President. Thank you very much.Thank you all.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nBelief in Iran and Syria's seriousness in their post-conference statements to help stabilize Iraq\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you very much, Mr. President. Grazie, Mr. Prime Minister.Mr. President, in your meeting with His Holiness Pope Francis, did he register any objections with you about the contraception coverage mandate in the Affordable Care Act or your efforts to advance the rights of gays and lesbians in the United States that worry so many Catholics? And what were his concerns?And on Russia, with reports of troops building on the Ukrainian border, by taking the military option off the table are you sending a signal to Vladimir Putin that other parts of Ukraine are his for the taking? And why not send multinational peacekeepers to the Ukrainian border as a deterrent?And to you, Mr. Prime Minister, the President said yesterday that the U.S. would defend any NATO ally. Are you making that same commitment when it comes to Russia?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThat's a lot of questions there, Jim. [] Do the Italian journalists, by the way, do this\u2014these sort of five-part questions? [] Same thing?[.] I can't say about Italian journalism. [] The\u2014all right, let me try to remember this. In terms of the meeting with His Holiness Pope Francis, we had a wide-ranging discussion. I would say that the largest bulk of the time was discussing two central concerns of his. One is the issues of the poor, the marginalized, those without opportunity, and growing inequality.And those of us as politicians have the task of trying to come up with policies to address issues, but His Holiness has the capacity to open people's eyes and make sure they're seeing that this is an issue. And he's discussed in the past, I think, the dangers of indifference or cynicism when it comes to our ability to reach out to those less fortunate or those locked out of opportunity.And then we spent a lot of time talking about the challenges of conflict and how elusive peace is around the world. There was some specific focus on the Middle East, where His Holiness has a deep interest in the Israeli-Palestinian issue, but also what's happening in Syria, what's happening in Lebanon, and the potential persecution of Christians. And I reaffirmed that it is central to U.S. foreign policy that we protect the interests of religious minorities around the world.But we also touched on regions like Latin America, where there's been tremendous progress in many countries, but there's been less progress in others.I think what\u2014the theme that stitched our conversation together was a belief that in politics and in life, the quality of empathy, the ability to stand in somebody else's shoes and to care for someone even if they don't look like you or talk like you or share your philosophy, that that's critical. It's the lack of empathy that makes it very easy for us to plunge into wars. It's the lack of empathy that allows us to ignore the homeless on the streets. And obviously, central to my Christian faith is a belief in treating others as they\u2014I'd have them treat me. And what's, I think, created so much love and excitement for His Holiness has been that he seems to live this and shows that joy continuously.In terms of domestic issues, the two issues that we touched on\u2014other than the fact that I invited and urged him to come visit the United States, telling him that people would be overjoyed to see him\u2014was immigration reform. And as someone who came from Latin America, I think he was very mindful of the plight of so many immigrants who are wonderful people, working hard, making contributions, many of their children are U.S. citizens, and yet they still live in the shadows, in many cases have been deported, and are separated from families. I described to him how I felt that there was still an opportunity for us to make this right and get a law passed.And he actually did not touch, in detail, on the Affordable Care Act. In my Cardinal\u2014in my meeting with his Secretary of State, Cardinal Parolin, we discussed briefly the issue of making sure that conscience and religious freedom was observed in the context of applying the law. And I explained to him that most religious organizations are entirely exempt. Religiously affiliated hospitals or universities or NGOs simply have to attest that they have a religious objection, in which case they are not required to provide contraception, although employees of theirs who choose are able to obtain it through the insurance company.And I pledged to continue to dialogue with the U.S. Conference of Bishops to make sure that we can strike the right balance, making sure that not only everybody has health care, but families, and women in particular, are able to enjoy the kind of health care coverage that the ACA offers, but that religious freedom is still observed.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nBy taking the military option off the table, are you sending a signal to Vladimir Putin that other parts of Ukraine are his for the taking?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Why haven't we heard anything from you so far about the soldiers that were killed in Niger?

They've been sent, or they're going out tonight, but they were written during the weekend. I will, at some point during the period of time, call the parents and the families\u2014because I have done that, traditionally. I felt very, very badly about that. I always feel badly. It's the toughest\u2014the toughest calls I have to make are the calls where this happens, soldiers are killed. It's a very difficult thing. Now, it gets to a point where, you know, you make four or five of them in one day\u2014it's a very, very tough day. For me, that's by far the toughest.So, the traditional way\u2014if you look at President Obama and other Presidents, most of them didn't make calls, a lot of them didn't make calls. I like to call when it's appropriate, when I think I'm able to do it. They have made the ultimate sacrifice.So, generally, I would say that I like to call. I'm going to be calling them. I want a little time to pass. I'm going to be calling them. I have\u2014as you know, since I've been President, I have.

Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about recent events along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Do you back President Karzai when he says he may send his troops into Pakistan to take care of some of the militants who are launching attacks on his territory? And do you think that the agreements that the new Government of Pakistan is pursuing with some of the militant tribes in that area amount to the sort of appeasement that you talked about in your speech last month?And, Mr. Prime Minister, I'd like to ask you about the meeting\u2014upcoming meeting in Saudi Arabia. What do you expect to come out of that meeting? And do you think it would be helpful if your friend there, standing there, Mr. Bush, were to see you in Jeddah at that meeting?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nOur strategy is to deny safe haven to extremists who would do harm to innocent people. And that's the strategy of Afghanistan. It needs to be the strategy of Pakistan. It's in all our interests to prevent those who murder innocent people to achieve political objectives to gain safe haven.And so we'd look forward to working\u2014 I mean, one thing that can happen is, there can be, you know, more dialogue between the Pak Government and the Afghan Government. Now, there was\u2014in the past, they had a jirga amongst tribal leaders in the region on both\u2014from both sides of the border that made a difference. And I think that would be a good idea to restart the jirga process.I know there needs to be dialogue between the intel services between the respective countries. And I know there needs to be better cooperation, and there needs to be trilateral cooperation on the border\u2014 trilateral being Pak, Afghan, and coalition border patrols\u2014to prevent people from coming back and forth across the border.And there's a lot of common ground. I repeat: It is in no one's interest that extremists have a safe haven from which to operate. And I'm, you know\u2014I mean\u2014and obviously, it's a testy situation there. And if I'm the President of a country and people are coming from one country to another\u2014allegedly coming from one country to another\u2014to kill innocent civilians on my side, I'd be concerned about it. But we can help. We can help calm the situation down and develop a strategy that will prevent these extremists from, you know, from developing safe haven and having freedom of movement. Can I say, I'm traveling to Jeddah next Sunday at the invitation of the King of Saudi Arabia. And I want a long-term dialogue, and this is part of a process, not an event, between oil producers and oil consumers. I think there is a view developing that the price of oil is increasingly dependent not just on today's demand and supply factors but on what people perceive as demand outstripping supply next year, in the medium term, and in the long term.And I want to tell the King of Saudi Arabia and others who are there that the world will build more nuclear power. And I have suggested that on present trends, it would be about 1,000 nuclear power stations over the next 30 years. The world will increase its use of renewables. The world will increase its use of coal. It will lessen its dependence on oil, and that the world is determined to make a more efficient use of oil.And I think this dialogue between producers and consumers is absolutely essential. President Bush has just been in Saudi Arabia. I have not been there recently. I want to go and talk to the King and talk to others there about what I believe should be a process whereby we understand what are the pressures on demand in future years, as well as we understand the pressures on supply. And I believe that that long-term debate about the future can have an effect on today's markets.Now, that's what the debate is about. And that is part of a process that I hope will continue, if necessary, with a meeting in London later and with further meetings, so that there is a genuine dialogue between producers and consumers about what is the most worrying situation in the world at the moment, and that is the trebling of the price of oil.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo you think it would be helpful if your friend there, standing there, Mr. Bush, were to see you in Jeddah at that meeting?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

I thought that was diplomacy. And it took a long time to get there. I mean, we're working hard to send a concerted message to the ians, a focused, unified message that the world believes you should not have a nuclear program. And so this is a multilateral approach to try to get the Government to alter its course on a nuclear weapons program.I can't think of any more robust diplomacy than to have more than one party at the table talking to the ians. And we did so through the United Nations at this case. If they want us at the table, we're more than willing to come, but there must be a verifiable suspension of this weapons program that is causing such grave concern.We'll continue to work with other nations. Matter of fact, I believe that it is easier for the United States to achieve certain diplomatic objectives when we work with other nations, which is precisely why we adopted the strategy we did in dealing with the ians.Sheryl.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo we have any leverage if we try diplomacy there?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

We're the strongest force in the world, but that's a strong force.And we started off a very rough relationship, and I think we have a very good relationship right now. So we'll see what happens.

And if you look back to the last 4, 5, 6 years\u2014but really go back further than that. In all fairness to President Obama, go back 20 years, 15 years. It was, really, a very dangerous situation. I consider it to be different now.Now, I may change. And if I change, you will know it very quickly. I will be very quick to tell you exactly what's going on. I may change. But right now we have a good relationship, and I think, probably, better than we've had for maybe 25 years, maybe forever. You know, they've been there a long time\u2014the grandfather, the father, the son. And they've been there for a long time, and nobody has done anything except me.

Ambivalent - The information requested is given in an incomplete way (e.g., the answer is too general, partial, implicit, dodging, or deflection)\n\n### Full Interview Question ###\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. In your opening remarks, you talked about that if your plan works the way you want it to work, it's going to increase consumer spending. But isn't consumer spending or overspending how we got into this mess? And if people get money back into their pockets, do you not want them saving it or paying down debt first before they start spending money into the economy?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, I don't think it's accurate to say that consumer spending got us into this mess. What got us into this mess initially were banks taking exorbitant, wild risks with other people's monies based on shaky assets. And because of the enormous leverage where they had $1 worth of assets and they were betting $30 on that $1, what we had was a crisis in the financial system. That led to a contraction of credit, which in turn meant businesses couldn't make payroll or make inventories, which meant that everybody became uncertain about the future of the economy, so people started making decisions accordingly, reducing investment, initiated layoffs, which in turn made things worse.Now, you are making a legitimate point, Chuck, about the fact that our savings rate has declined and this economy has been driven by consumer spending for a very long time, and that's not going to be sustainable. You know, if all we're doing is spending, and we're not making things, then over time other countries are going to get tired of lending us money and eventually the party is going to be over. Well, in fact, the party now is over.And so the sequence of how we're approaching this is as follows: Our immediate job is to stop the downward spiral, and that means putting money into consumers' pockets, it means loosening up credit, it means putting forward investments that not only employ people immediately but also lay the groundwork for long-term economic growth. And that, by the way, is important even if you're a fiscal conservative, because the biggest problem we're going to have with our Federal budget is if we continue a situation in which there are no tax revenues because economic growth is plummeting at the same time as we've got more demands for unemployment insurance, we've got more demands for people who've lost their health care, more demand for food stamps. That will put enormous strains on the Federal budget as well as the State budget.So the most important thing we can do for our budget crisis right now is to make sure that the economy doesn't continue to tank. And that's why passing the economic recovery plan is the right thing to do, even though I recognize that it's expensive. Look, I would love not to have to spend money right now. I'd--this notion that somehow I came in here just ginned up to spend $800 billion, that wasn't how I envisioned my Presidency beginning, but we have to adapt to existing circumstances.Now, what we are going to also have to do is to make sure that as soon as the economy stabilizes, investment begins again; we're no longer contracting but we're growing; that our mid-term and long-term budget is dealt with. And I think the same is true for individual consumers. Right now they're just trying to figure out, how do I make sure that if I lose my job, I'm still going to be able to make my mortgage payments. Or they're worried about how am I going to pay next month's bills. So they're not engaging in a lot of long-term financial planning.Once the economy stabilizes and people are less fearful, then I do think that we're going to have to start thinking about how do we operate more prudently, because there's no such thing as a free lunch. So if you want to get--if you want to buy a house, then putting zero down and buying a house that is probably not affordable for you in case something goes wrong, that's something that has to be reconsidered.So we're going to have to change our bad habits. But right now, the key is making sure that we pull ourselves out of the economic slump that we're in.All right.

The American Government, last week, have manifested a lot of concern with the investments of some foreign companies in the oil industry in Iran. And in this week, the American Ambassador in Brazil made it very clear that this concern also extends to Petrobras investments that Petrobras considers strategic. So I'd like to ask President Lula if, in his assessment, Petrobras should continue to make businesses with Iran or should get away from Iran, like the United States would like us all to do?So\u2014and I would like to ask President Bush, why does the United States want Petrobras to be out of Iran if the country has fulfilled all its sanctions that was approved\u2014passed by the U.N.?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I am convinced that Petrobras will continue to invest in oil prospection in . has been an important trade partner for Brazil. They buy from us more than $1 billion, and they don't almost sell anything to us. So I'm an advocate that trade, fair trade is the trade that you buy and sell. You sell and buy, you can't just sell.And then there's also political issues in each country. Each country faces their own domestic issues. But up until now, has not been a victim of any sanction that was proposed by the U.N. I know that there's political divergence on this between and other countries, but with Brazil, we have no political divergence with them, so we will continue to work together with on what is of the interest of Brazil. I don't see any major issue to do it in a different way. Every nation makes the decisions that they think is best in their interest. Brazil is a sovereign nation; he just articulated a sovereign decision. And as you mentioned, the trade that you were discussing was not in violation of any U.N.\u2014in any U.N. mandate.Our position is that we would hope that nations would be very careful in dealing with , particularly since is trying to develop a nuclear weapon, and a major threat to world peace is if the ians had a nuclear weapon. And that is why there are sanctions imposed at the United Nations, as a result of collaboration between the United States, EU, China, and Russia, to make it clear to the ian regime that there is a better way forward other than isolation.We have no problems with the ian people. As a matter of fact, the United States highly respects the people of . We respect the history of ; we respect the rich traditions of . We, however, are deeply concerned about an ian Government that is in violation of international accords in their attempt to develop a nuclear weapon. And therefore, whatever comments you hear reflect that concern. And we will continue to work with the international community to say that it is in the world's interest that not develop a weapon. It is in the interest of peace that they not develop a weapon.And I'm hopeful that the people of will be tired of the isolation. I would hope that there would be some rationality amongst their leaders in choosing a better way forward for the people. They're depriving their people of a lot of opportunity.Now, having said that, the United States does believe that it's in our interest that we have people-to-people exchanges. As I say, we have no problem with the ian people. As a matter of fact, we just sent a wrestling team to , all attempting to make it clear to the ian people that we're interested in having a constructive relationship. And it is the decisions of their Government that are preventing that from happening.Thank you.

Will this be one of them?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI never release my full movie list.But let's talk of the specifics of what we now know. The FBI announced today and we can confirm that North Korea engaged in this attack. I think it says something interesting about North Korea that they decided to have the state mount an all-out assault on a movie studio because of a satirical movie starring Seth Rogen and James Flacco [Franco].because of a satirical movie starring Seth Rogen and James Flacco [Franco].because of a satirical movie starring Seth Rogen and James Flacco [Franco]*.They caused a lot of damage, and we will respond. We will respond proportionally, and we'll respond in a place and time and manner that we choose. It's not something that I will announce here today at a press conference.More broadly, though, this points to the need for us to work with the international community to start setting up some very clear rules of the road in terms of how the Internet and cyber operates. Right now it's sort of the Wild West. And part of the problem is, is you've got weak states that can engage in these kinds of attacks, you've got nonstate actors that can do enormous damage. That's part of what makes this issue of cybersecurity so urgent.Again, this is part of the reason why it's going to be so important for Congress to work with us and get a actual bill passed that allows for the kind of information sharing we need. Because if we don't put in place the kind of architecture that can prevent these attacks from taking place, this is not just going to be affecting movies, this is going to be affecting our entire economy in ways that are extraordinarily significant.And by the way, I hear you're moving to Europe.

Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to come back to the debt ceiling, because in the summer of 2011, you said that you wouldn't negotiate on the debt ceiling, and you did. Last year, you said that you wouldn't extend any of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, and you did. So as you say now that you're not going to negotiate on the debt ceiling this year, why should House Republicans take that seriously and think that if we get to the 1-minute-to-midnight scenario, that you're not going to back down?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, Julianna, let's take the example of this year and the fiscal cliff. I didn't say that I would not have any conversations at all about extending the Bush tax cuts. What I said was we weren't going to extend Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, and we didn't. Now, you can argue that during the campaign, I saidI set the criteria for wealthy at 250, and we ended up being at 400. But the fact of the matter is millionaires, billionaires, are paying significantly more in taxes, just as I said. So from the start, my concern was making sure that we had a Tax Code that was fair and that protected the middle class, and my biggest priority was making sure that middle class taxes did not go up.The difference between this year and 2011 is the fact that we've already made $1.2 trillion in cuts. And at the time, I indicated that there were cuts that we could sensibly make that would not damage our economy, would not impede growth. I said at the time I think we should pair it up with revenue in order to have an overall balanced package. But my own budget reflected cuts in discretionary spending. My own budget reflected the cuts that needed to be made, and we've made those cuts.Now, the challenge going forward is that we've now made some big cuts, and if we're going to do further deficit reduction, the only way to do it is in a balanced and responsible way.The alternative is for us to go ahead and cut commitments that we've made on things like Medicare or Social Security or Medicaid and for us to fundamentally change commitments that we've made to make sure that seniors don't go into poverty or that children who are disabled are properly cared for. For us to change that contract we've made with the American people rather than look at options like closing loopholes for corporations that they don't need, that points to a long-term trend in which we have fundamentally, I think, undermined what people expect out of this Government, which is, is that parties sit down, they negotiate, they compromise, but they also reflect the will of the American people; that you don't have one narrow faction that is able to simply dictate 100 percent of what they want all the time or otherwise threaten that we destroy the American economy.Another way of putting it is, we've got to break the habit of negotiating through crisis over and over again. And now wenow is as good of a time as any, at the start of my second term, because if we continue down this path, then there's really no stopping the principle. I mean, literallyeven in divided government, even where we've got a Democratic President and a Democratic Senatethat a small group in the House of Representatives could simply say every 2 months, every 3 months, every 6 months, every year, we are going to more and more change the economy in ways that we prefer, despite strong objections of Americans all across the country, or otherwise, we're going to have America not pay its bills. And that is no way for us to do business.And by the way, I would make the same argument if it was a Republican President and a Republican Senate, and you had a handful of Democrats who were suggesting that we are going to hijack the process and make sure that either we get our way 100 percent of the time, or otherwise, we are going to default on America's obligations.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhy should House Republicans take your statement of not negotiating on the debt ceiling seriously and believe that you will not back down in a last-minute scenario?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. What kind of assurances did you give Prime Minister Netanyahu about the role that the U.S. would play if diplomacy and economic sanctions fail to work to convince Iranian--Iran's leaders to change their behavior, and Israel goes ahead and prepares to strike a nuclear facility? What kind of assurances did you tell him? And shouldn't we--I recognize the difference between debate and bluster--but shouldn't we be having in this country a vigorous debate about what could happen in the case of a Middle East war in a way that, sadly, we did not do before going into Iraq?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I think there's no doubt that those who are suggesting or proposing or beating the drums of war should explain clearly to the American people what they think the costs and benefits would be.I'm not one of those people, because what I've said is, is that we have a window through which we can resolve this issue peacefully. We have put forward an international framework that is applying unprecedented pressure. The Iranians just stated that they are willing to return to the negotiating table. And we've got the opportunity, even as we maintain that pressure, to see how it plays out.I'm not going to go into the details of my conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu. But what I said publicly doesn't differ greatly from what I said privately. Israel is a sovereign nation that has to make its own decisions about how best to preserve its security. And as I said over the last several days, I am deeply mindful of the historical precedents that weigh on any Prime Minister of Israel when they think about the potential threats to Israel and the Jewish homeland.What I've also said is that because sanctions are starting to have significant effect inside of Iran--and that's not just my assessment, that's, I think, a uniform assessment--because the sanctions are going to be even tougher in the coming months, because they're now starting to affect their oil industry, their central bank, and because we're now seeing noises about them returning to the negotiating table, that it is deeply in everybody's interests, the United States, Israel, and the world's, to see if this can be resolved in a peaceful fashion.And so this notion that somehow we have a choice to make in the next week or 2 weeks, or month or 2 months, is not borne out by the facts. And the argument that we've made to the Israelis is that we have made an unprecedented commitment to their security. There is an unbreakable bond between our two countries, but one of the functions of friends is to make sure that we provide honest and unvarnished advice in terms of what is the best approach to achieve a common goal, particularly one in which we have a stake. This is not just an issue of Israeli interest, this is an issue of U.S. interests. It's also not just an issue of consequences for Israel if action is taken prematurely. There are consequences to the United States as well.And so I do think that any time we consider military action, that the American people understand there's going to be a price to pay. Sometimes, it's necessary. But we don't do it casually.When I visit Walter Reed, when I sign letters to families that haven't--whose loved ones have not come home, I am reminded that there is a cost. Sometimes, we bear that cost. But we think it through. We don't play politics with it. When we have in the past--when we haven't thought it through and it gets wrapped up in politics--we make mistakes. And typically, it's not the folks who are popping off who pay the price. It's these incredible men and women in uniform and their families who pay the price.And as a consequence, I think it's very important for us to take a careful, thoughtful, sober approach to what is a real problem. And that's what we've been doing over the last 3 years. That's what I intend to keep doing.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nShouldn't we be having a vigorous debate about what could happen in the case of a Middle East war in a way that we did not do before going into Iraq?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

And I\u2014you know, after 61\u20442 years of being the President, I've seen some unusual\u2014 I've been to some unusual places, and I've met some interesting people. And I was in awe, and it was a moving experience for me.We didn't talk about just war. He did express deep concern about the Christians inside Iraq, that he was concerned that the society that was evolving would not tolerate the Christian religion. And I assured him we're working hard to make sure that they\u2014people lived up to the Constitution, that modern Constitution voted on by the people that would honor people from different walks of life and different attitudes.We talked about a lot of other subjects. We talked about our attempts to help the people in Africa deal with HIV/AIDS and malaria and hunger. I reminded him that we made a significant commitment to that end, that about 3 years ago, 50,000 people were getting antiretroviral drugs. Now over 1,100,000 people are getting them, as a result of our initiative on HIV/AIDS, and that I'm going to double that commitment\u2014or ask Congress to double the commitment from 15 billion to 30 billion.I talked to him about our malaria program, about how we intend to reduce malaria by 50 percent in certain countries, and that I'd continue to remind the world of our duty to work together to achieve a major goal, which is to try to eradicate malaria throughout Africa.And I talked to him about our attempts to feed the hungry, and I also reminded him that we've got poor people in our own neighborhood that need to be affected.He talked about immigration. He's watching the immigration debate very closely in America. And I told him I was a person who strongly supports comprehensive immigration reform that, on the one hand, we'll enforce our law; on the other hand, we need to treat people with dignity. And we had a good discussion.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat did you tell the President today about the trials going on here involving Americans?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

In that spirit and in that venue, will you call on Israel to declare its nuclear program and sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty? And if not, why wouldn't other countries see that as an incentive not to sign on to the treaty that you say is important to strengthen?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, Scott, initially, you were talking about U.S. behavior, and then suddenly, we were talking about Israel. Let me talk about the United States. I do think that as part of the NPT, our obligation as the largest nuclear power in the world is to take steps to reducing our nuclear stockpile. And that's what the START Treaty was about, sending a message that we are going to meet our obligations.And as far as Israel goes, I'm not going to comment on their program. What I'm going to point to is the fact that consistently we have urged all countries to become members of the NPT.So there's no contradiction there. We think it is important that we have a international approach that is universal and that rests on three pillars: that those of us who have nuclear weapons are making serious efforts to reduce those stockpiles; that we all are working against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and those countries that don't currently have nuclear weapons make the decision not to pursue nuclear weapons; and that all countries have access to peaceful nuclear energy.And so whether we're talking about Israel or any other country, we think that becoming part of the NPT is important. And that, by the way, is not a new position. That's been a consistent position of the United States Government even prior to my administration.Let me call on Stephen Collinson of AFP [Agence France-Presse].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWill you call on Israel to declare its nuclear program and sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

You spoke positively about the role of diplomacy in North Korea, and you obviously gave it a long time to work.

I thought that was diplomacy. And it took a long time to get there. I mean, we're working hard to send a concerted message to the ians, a focused, unified message that the world believes you should not have a nuclear program. And so this is a multilateral approach to try to get the Government to alter its course on a nuclear weapons program.I can't think of any more robust diplomacy than to have more than one party at the table talking to the ians. And we did so through the United Nations at this case. If they want us at the table, we're more than willing to come, but there must be a verifiable suspension of this weapons program that is causing such grave concern.We'll continue to work with other nations. Matter of fact, I believe that it is easier for the United States to achieve certain diplomatic objectives when we work with other nations, which is precisely why we adopted the strategy we did in dealing with the ians.Sheryl.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhere does diplomacy fit in, in terms of Iran?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. Do you believe that Turkey is doing enough to strengthen its northwest border with Syria? How is it that a NATO country with as large a military as Turkey has has not sealed this border? And is that something that you raised today with President Erdogan?And then, to put a finer point on the climate change question, can leaders gathered here believe that the United States will keep its commitments, even after you've left office, if a Republican succeeds you in the White House?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nJust with respect to my successor, let me, first of all, say that I'm anticipating a Democrat succeeding me. [] I'm confident in the wisdom of the American people on that front.But even if somebody from a different party succeeded me, one of the things that you find is when you're in this job, you think about it differently than when you're just running for the job. And what you realize is what I mentioned earlier, that American leadership involves not just playing to a narrow constituency back home, but you now are, in fact, at the center of what happens around the world and that your credibility and America's ability to influence events depends on taking seriously what other countries care about.Now, the fact of the matter is, there's a reason why you have the largest gathering of world leaders probably in human history here in Paris. Everybody else is taking climate change really seriously. They think it's a really big problem. It spans political parties. I mean, you travel around Europe, and you talk to leaders of governments and the opposition, and they are arguing about a whole bunch of things; one thing they're not arguing about is whether the science of climate change is real and whether or not we have to do something about it.So whoever is the President\u2014next President of the United States, if they come in and they suggest somehow that that global consensus\u2014not just 99.5 percent of scientists and experts, but 99 percent of world leaders\u2014think this is really important, I think the President of the United States is going to need to think this is really important. And that's why it's important for us to not project what's being said on a campaign trail, but to do what's right and make the case.And I would note that the American people, I think in the most recent survey, two-thirds of them said America should be a signatory to any agreement that emerges that is actually addressing climate change in a serious way. So the good news is, the politics inside the United States is changing as well. Sometimes, it may be hard for Republicans to support something that I'm doing, but that's more a matter of the games Washington plays. And that's why I think people should be confident that we'll meet our commitments on this.With respect to Turkey, I have had repeated conversations with President Erdogan about the need to close the border between Turkey and Syria. We've seen some serious progress on that front, but there are still some gaps. In particular, there's about 98 kilometers that are still used as a transit point for foreign fighters, ISIL shipping out fuel for sale that helps finance their terrorist activities.And so we have been having our militaries work together to determine how a combination of air and Turkish ground forces on the Turkish side of the border can do a much better job of sealing the border than currently is. And I think President Erdogan recognizes that. I'm also encouraged by the fact that President Erdogan and the EU had a series of meetings around\u2014or Turkey and the EU had a series of meetings around the issue of the Turkish-Greek border. We have to remind ourselves, Turkey has taken on an enormous humanitarian effort. There are millions of Syrians who are displaced and living inside of Turkey. Not just refugee camps, but they are now moving into major cities throughout Turkey. That puts enormous strains on their infrastructure, on their housing, on employment. And Turkey has continued to keep those borders open for people in real need.So I'm proud that the United States is the single largest contributor of humanitarian aid for Syrian refugees. I'm glad that the EU is looking to do more to help Turkey manage those refugee flows. But I also think the EU rightly wants to see the kind of orderly process along the Turkish-Greek border that's necessary for Europe to be able to regulate the amount of refugees it's absorbing and to save the lives of refugees who are oftentimes taking enormous risks because they're being ferried back and forth by human traffickers who are now operating in the same ways that you see drug traffickers operating under: at enormous profit and without regard for human life.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhether the issue of Turkey's border with Syria was discussed with President Erdogan\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Mr. President, at a speech Friday that many of us covered, Vice President Biden said the following thing about a conversation the two of you had in the Oval Office, about a subject he didn't disclose: If we do everything right, if we do it with absolute certainty, if we stand up there and we really make the tough decisions, there's still a 30 percent chance we're going to get it wrong. Since the Vice President brought it up, can you tell the American people, sir, what you were talking about? And if not, can you at least reassure them it wasn't the stimulus bill or the bank rescue plan--[laughter]--and if in general, you agree with that ratio of success, 30 percent failure, 70 percent success?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYou know, I don't remember exactly what Joe was referring to. [] Not surprisingly. But let me try this out. I think what Joe may have been suggesting, although I wouldn't put numerical--I wouldn't ascribe any numerical percentage to any of this--is that given the magnitude of the challenges that we have, any single thing that we do is going to be part of the solution, not all of the solution. And as I said in my introductory remarks, not everything we do is going to work out exactly as we intended it to work out.This is an unprecedented problem. And when you talk to economists, there is some general sense of how we're going to move forward; there's some strong consensus about the need for a recovery package of a certain magnitude; there's a strong consensus that you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket, all tax cuts or all investment, but that there should be a range of approaches.But even if we do everything right on that, we've still got to deal with what we just talked about, the financial system, and making sure that banks are lending again. We're still going to have to deal with housing. We're still going to have to make sure that we've got a regulatory structure--a regulatory architecture for the financial system that prevents crises like this from occurring again. Those are all big, complicated tasks. So I don't know whether Joe was referring to that, but I use that as a launching point to make a general point about these issues.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDo you agree with the ratio of 30 percent failure and 70 percent success mentioned by the Vice President, in relation to a certain subject that was discussed?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. June was the deadliest month for U.S. troops in\u2014 since we began the war in Afghanistan. Has Afghanistan replaced Iraq as the central front of the war on terror? And is Al Qaida and the Taliban taking the upper hand? And also, is it possible that we could send additional U.S. troops there sooner than the 2009 date that you've been talking about?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nFirst of all, any time a troop loses their life, whether it be in Afghanistan, Iraq, or elsewhere, our hearts go out to their families. And I am so appreciative that, in a time of danger, Americans are willing to step up and volunteer and sacrifice.Secondly, it has been a tough month in Afghanistan, but it's also been a tough month for the Taliban. You know, one reason why there have been more deaths is because our troops are taking the fight to a tough enemy. You know, an enemy who doesn't like our presence there because they don't like the idea of America denying safe haven. America is pressing an ideology that's opposite of theirs, and so of course there's going to be resistance.I am confident that the strategy is going to work, which is to confront the Taliban, confront elements of Al Qaida, and, at the same time, encourage the growth of a free society by good economic policy, good education policy, and good health policy.We're constantly reviewing troop needs, troop levels. We're halfway through 2008; as I said, we're going to increase the troops by 2009. One thing, however, that you've got to understand is that we have doubled Afghan troops\u2014coalition troops have doubled from 2 years ago. So there is an active presence, and there are more troops there than there were. But we're constantly reassessing and seeing whether or not we can change tactics in order to achieve our objective.Toby [Tabassum Zakaria, Reuters].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAl Qaida and the Taliban's upper hand\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

One follow-up on energy, sir. You also met with energy consumers about supply. What steps are you considering taking if OPEC Plus does not raise supply? And do you see any irony in pushing them to increase oil production at the same time that you're going to COP26 to urge people to lower emissions?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, on the surface, it seems like an irony, but the truth of the matter is\u2014you've all known; everyone knows\u2014that the idea we're going to be able to move to renewable energy overnight and not have\u2014from this moment on, not use oil or not use gas or not use hydrogen is just not rational.Certain things we can wipe out and we don't have to do. We should be moving immediately to get rid of\u2014as they've adopted here my proposal\u2014to end methane, to deal with a whole range of things.But it does, on the surface, seem inconsistent, but it's not at all inconsistent in that no one has anticipated that this year we'd be in a position\u2014or even next year\u2014that we're not going to use any more oil or gas; that we're not going to be engaged in any fossil fuels. We're going to stop subsidizing those fossil fuels. We're going to be making significant changes.And it just makes the argument that we should move more rapidly to renewable energy: to wind and solar and other means of energy.But the idea that we're just going to end and somehow\u2014but it does, on the surface, I admit to you. We're going to COP to deal with renewable energy, and I'm saying, Why are you guys cutting off oil and raising the price just to make it look harder for us? But it's a legitimate question.I think, though, that if anybody thinks about it, no one ever thought that tomorrow\u2014for example, it's going to take us between now and 2030 to have half the vehicles in America electric vehicles. So the idea we're not going to need gasoline for automobiles is just not realistic. But we will get to the point that, by 2050, we have zero emissions.Jim?

Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, it seems pretty clear where this Iraq vote in the House is headed. Your Press Secretary has said repeatedly that Members of Congress ought to watch what they say and be concerned about the message that they're sending to our enemy. I'm wondering, do you believe that a vote of disapproval of your policy emboldens the enemy? Does it undermine your ability to carry out your policies there? And also, what are you doing to persuade the Democratic leadership in Congress not to restrict your ability to spend money in Iraq?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes, thanks. A couple of points: One, that I understand the Congress is going to express their opinion, and it's very clear where the Democrats are, and some Republicans; I know that. They didn't like the decision I made. And by the way, that doesn't mean that I think that they're not good, honorable citizens of the country\u2014just have a different opinion. I considered some of their opinions and felt like it would not lead to a country that could govern itself, sustain itself, and be an ally in the war on terror\u2014one.Secondly, my hope, however, is that this nonbinding resolution doesn't try to turn into a binding policy that prevents our troops from doing that which I have asked them to do. That's why I keep reminding people, on the one hand, you vote for David Petraeus in a unanimous way, and then the other hand, you say that you're not going to fund the strategy that he thought was necessary to do his job, a strategy he testified to in front of the Senate. I'm going to make it very clear to the Members of Congress, starting now, that they need to fund our troops, and they need to make sure we have the flexibility necessary to get the job done.Secondly, I find it interesting that there is a declaration about a plan that they have not given a chance to work. Again, I understand; I understand. The other part of your question?\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDoes a vote of disapproval of the president's policy embolden the enemy?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Should Britain leave the European Union if there is no agreement by October 31?And for the Prime Minister, what would be the ramifications for the U.K. if there is not a deal?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I don't like to take positions in things that I'm not, you know, really\u2014I understand the issue very well. I really predicted what was going to happen. Some of you remember that prediction. It was a strong prediction, made at a certain location, on a development we were opening the day before it happened. And I thought it was going to happen because of immigration more than anything else, but probably, it happens for a lot of reasons.But I would say, yes, I would think that it will happen and it probably should happen. This is a great, great country, and it wants its own identity. It wants to have its own borders. It wants to run its own affairs. This is a very, very special place. And I think it deserves a special place. And I thought maybe for that reason\u2014and for others\u2014but that reason, it was going to happen.Yes, I think it will happen, and I believe the Prime Minister has brought it to a very good point where something will take place in the not-too-distant future. I think she's done a very good job. I believe it would be good for the country, yes.. And from my point of view, I believe it is important for us to deliver Brexit. We gave that choice to the British people. Parliament overwhelmingly gave the choice to the British people. We should now deliver on that choice. I continue to believe that, actually, it's in the best interests of the U.K. to leave the European Union in an orderly way with a deal. I think we have a good deal. Sadly, the Labour Party and other MPs have, so far, stopped us from delivering Brexit and that deal.But we will\u2014but obviously, this is an issue that is going to continue here in the U.K. I think the important thing is we deliver Brexit. And once we're out of the European Union, we will be able to do what we've been talking about today and develop not just that free trade agreement, but a broader economic partnership into the future.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nRamifications for the U.K. if there is no deal.\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

And it's just totally irresponsible, in my view.And I just think that\u2014I mean, I'm confident that the mainstream Republican Party no longer\u2014does not support what he's doing.

What is your level of confidence that if you are able to reach a comprehensive deal with the Speaker, that he will be able to bring his members onboard and get it passed? Essentially, do you still trust Speaker Boehner in this process?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThere is no doubt that the Speaker has challenges in his caucus, and I recognize that. I'm often reminded when I speak to the Republican leadership that the majority of their caucus's membership come from districts that I lost. All right? And so sometimes, they may not see an incentive in cooperating with me, in part because they're more concerned about challenges from a Tea Party candidate or challenges from the right, and cooperating with me may make them vulnerable. I recognize that.But, goodness, if this past week has done anything, it should just give us some perspective. If there's one thing we should have after this week, it should be a sense of perspective about what's important. And I would like to think that members of their\u2014that caucus would say to themselves: You know what, we disagree with the President on a whole bunch of things. We wish the other guy had won. We're going to fight him on a whole range of issues over the next 4 years. We think his philosophy is all screwed up. But right now what the country needs is for us to compromise, get a deficit reduction deal in place, make sure middle class taxes don't go up, make sure that we're laying the foundations for growth, give certainty to businesses large and small, not put ourselves through some sort of self-inflicted crisis every 6 months, allow ourselves time to focus on things like preventing the tragedy in Newtown from happening again, focus on issues like energy, immigration reform, and all the things that will really make a determination as to whether our country grows over the next 4 years, 10 years, 40 years.And if you just pull back from the immediate political battles, if you kind of peel off the partisan war paint, then we should be able to get something done.And I think the Speaker would like to get that done. I think an environment needs to be created within not just the House Republican Caucus, but also among Senate Republicans that say, the campaign is over and let's see if we can do what's right for the country, at least for the next month. And then, we can reengage in all the other battles that they'll want to fight.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nLevel of confidence in reaching a comprehensive deal with the Speaker and his ability to bring his members onboard and get it passed.\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

This is Mark Riley from 7News, Australia. Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about the other rising giant of our region, India. And the Prime Minister might like to add some comments. How significant is it for the U.S. that Australia is now considering selling uranium to India? And could you clear up for us what influence or encouragement your administration gave Australia as it made that decision?And also, the decision is so India can produce clean energy. In that regard, you're aware that our Parliament has passed a new bill pricing carbon, a carbon tax, if you like. But we're intrigued about where America is going on this issue. And countries like Australia don't see a carbon trading system in the world working unless America is a big part of it. Can you tell us, is it your wish that American will have an emissions trading scheme across the Nation within the next 5 years or so? How heavily do you want to see America involved in an emissions trading scheme globally? Or has this become too politically hard for you?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nGood. Well, first of all, with respect to India, we have not had any influence, I suspect, on Australia's decision to explore what its relationship in terms of the peaceful use of nuclear energy in India might be. I suspect that you've got some pretty smart Government officials here who figured out that India is a big player and that the Australia-India relationship is one that should be cultivated. So they--I don't think Julia or anybody else needs my advice in figuring that out. This is part of your neighborhood, and you are going to make bilateral decisions about how to move forward.I think, without wading into the details, the discussions that are currently taking place here in Australia around that relationship and the nuclear issue with India are ones that are compatible with international law, compatible with decisions that were made in the NPT. And I will watch with interest what's determined. But this is not something between the United States and Australia, this is something between India and Australia.With respect to carbon emissions, I think I share the view of your Prime Minister and most scientists in the world that climate change is a real problem and that human activity is contributing to it and that we all have a responsibility to find ways to reduce our carbon emissions.Each country is trying to figure out how to do that most effectively. Here in Australia, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, you've moved forward with a bold strategy. In the United States, although we haven't passed a what we call a cap-and-trade system, an exchange, what we have done is, for example, taken steps to double fuel efficiency standard on cars, which will have an enormous impact on removing carbon from the atmosphere.We've invested heavily in clean energy research. We believe very strongly that with improved efficiencies and a whole step--a whole range of steps that we can meet and the commitments that we made in Copenhagen and Cancun. And as we move forward over the next several years, my hope is, is that the United States, as one of several countries with a big carbon footprint, can find further ways to reduce our carbon emissions. I think that's good for the world. I actually think, over the long term, it's good for our economies as well, because it's my strong belief that industries, utilities, individual consumers, we're all going to have to adapt how we use energy and how we think about carbon.Now, another belief that I think the Prime Minister and I share is that the advanced economies can't do this alone. So part of our insistence when we are in multilateral fora--and I will continue to insist on this when we go to Durban--is that if we are taking a series of steps, then it's important that emerging economies like China and India are also part of the bargain. It doesn't mean that they have to do exactly what we do. We understand that in terms of per capita carbon emissions, they've got a long way to go before they catch up to us. But it does mean that they've got to take seriously their responsibilities as well.And so ultimately, what we want is a mechanism whereby all countries are making an effort. And it's going to be a tough slog, particularly at a time when the economies are--a lot of economies are still struggling. But I think it's actually one that over the long term can be beneficial.Jackie Calmes [New York Times].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nIs it your wish that American will have an emissions trading scheme across the Nation within the next 5 years or so?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to go back to the situation in Ukraine. If this cease-fire does take effect and appears to be holding, would you and your European counterparts back away from these sanctions that you say you've prepared? Or do you feel that it's important to levy these sanctions regardless of this cease-fire agreement? And if I could go back to the Rapid Response Force, can you say specifically what U.S. contributions will be in terms of troop numbers and equipment? Is it beyond the agreement that you announced\u2014or the proposal you announced in Warsaw?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWith respect to the cease-fire agreement, obviously, we are hopeful, but based on past experience also skeptical that, in fact, the separatists will follow through and the Russians will stop violating Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. So it has to be tested. And I know that the Europeans are discussing at this point the final shape of their sanctions measures. It's my view that if you look at President Poroshenko's plan, it is going to take some time to implement. And as a consequence, for us to move forward based on what is currently happening on the ground with sanctions\u2014while acknowledging that if in fact the elements of the plan that has been signed are implemented, then those sanctions could be lifted\u2014is a more likely way for us to ensure that there's follow-through. But that's something that obviously we'll consult closely with our European partners to determine.I do want to point out, though, that the only reason that we're seeing this cease-fire at this moment is because of both the sanctions that have already been applied and the threat of further sanctions, which are having a real impact on the Russian economy and have isolated Russia in a way that we have not seen in a very long time.The path for Russia to rejoin the community of nations that respects international law is still there, and we encourage President Putin to take it. But the unity and the firmness that we've seen in the trans-Atlantic alliance in supporting Ukraine and applying sanctions has been, I think, a testimony to how seriously people take the basic principle that big countries can't just stomp on little countries or force them to change their policies and give up their sovereignty.So I'm very pleased with the kind of work that's been done throughout this crisis in Ukraine, and I think U.S. leadership has been critical throughout that process.With respect to the Rapid Response Forces and the readiness action plan that we've put forward, in Warsaw, I announced $1 billion in our initiative. A sizeable portion of that will be devoted to implementing various aspects of this readiness action plan.We've already increased obviously rotations of personnel in the Baltic States, for example. We have the air policing. We have the activities that are taking place in the Baltic and the Black Sea. But this allows us to supplement it. It allows us to coordinate it and integrate it further with additional contributions from other partners. And what it signifies is NATO's recognition that, in light of recent Russian actions as well as rhetoric, we want to make it crystal clear: We mean what we say when we're talking about our article 5 commitments. And an increased presence serves as the most effective deterrent to any additional Russian aggression that we might see.Angela Keane, Bloomberg.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nIf the ce\ufeffase-fire in Ukraine is successful, would the President and European counterparts withdraw the prepared sanctions?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. Many experts, from Nouriel Roubini to Senator Schumer, have said that it will cost the Government more than a trillion dollars to really fix the financial system. During the campaign, you promised the American people that you won't just tell them what they want to hear, but what they need to hear. Won't the Government need far more than the $350 billion that's remaining in the financial rescue funds to really solve the credit crisis?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, the credit crisis is real and it's not over. We averted catastrophe by passing the TARP legislation. But as I said before, because of a lack of clarity and consistency in how it was applied, a lack of oversight in how the money went out, we didn't get as big of a bang for the buck as we should have.My immediate task is making sure that the second half of that money, $350 billion, is spent properly. That's my first job. Before I even think about what else I've got to do, my first task is to make sure that my Secretary of the Treasury, Tim Geithner, working with Larry Summers, my National Economic Adviser, and others, are coming up with the best possible plan to use this money wisely--in a way that's transparent; in a way that provides clear oversight; that we are conditioning any money that we give to banks on them reducing executive compensation to reasonable levels; and to make sure that they're not wasting that money.We are going to have to work with the banks in an effective way to clean up their balance sheets so that some trust is restored within the marketplace, because right now part of the problem is that nobody really knows what's on the banks' books. Any given bank, they're not sure what kinds of losses are there. We've got to open things up and restore some trust.We also have to deal with the housing issue in a clear and consistent way. I don't want to preempt my Secretary of the Treasury; he's going to be laying out these principles in great detail tomorrow. But my instruction to him has been, let's get this right, let's create a template in which we're restoring market confidence. And the reason that's so important is because we don't know yet whether we're going to need additional money or how much additional money we'll need until we've seen how successful we are at restoring a sense of confidence in the marketplace, that the Federal Government and the Federal Reserve Bank and the FDIC, working in concert, know what they're doing. That can make a big difference in terms of whether or not we attract private capital back into the marketplace.And ultimately, the Government cannot substitute for all the private capital that has been withdrawn from the system. We've got to restore confidence so that private capital goes back in.Okay.

Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday, in a speech before business leaders, you said that you want China to play by the rules. And then your staff later said that, in a bilateral meeting with President Hu, that you expressed that American business leaders are growing frustrated with the pace of change in China's economy. What rules is China not playing by? What specific steps do you need to see from China? And what punitive actions is your administration willing to take, as you said it would yesterday, if China does not play by the rules?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, I also said yesterday that we welcome the peaceful rise of . It is in America's interests to see succeed in lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. can be a source of stability and help to underwrite international norms and codes of conduct.And so what we've done over the last 2 years is to try to develop a frank, consistent, open relationship and dialogue with , and it's yielded considerable benefits, for example, support for issues like . But what I've also said to Chinese leadership since I came into office is that when it comes to their economic practices, there are a range of things that they have done that disadvantage not just the United States, but a whole host of their trading partners and countries in the region.The most famous example is the issue of 's currency. Most economists estimate that the RMB is devalued by 20 to 25 percent. That means our exports to are that much more expensive and their imports into the United States are that much cheaper. Now, there's been slight improvement over the last year, partly because of U.S. pressure, but it hasn't been enough. And it's time for them to go ahead and move towards a market-based system for their currency.Now, we recognize they may not be able to do it overnight, but they can do it much more quickly than they've done it so far. And by the way, that would not necessarily be a bad thing for the Chinese economy, because they've been so focused on export-driven growth that they've neglected domestic consumption, building up domestic markets. It makes them much more vulnerable to shocks in the global economy. It throws the whole world economy out of balance because they're not buying as much as they could be from other countries.And this is not something that's inconsistent with where Chinese leadership say they want to go. The problem is, is that you've got a bunch of export producers in who like the system as it is and making changes are difficult for them politically. I get it. But the United States and other countries, I think understandably, feel that enough's enough.That's not the only concern we have. Intellectual property rights and protections--companies that do business in consistently report problems in terms of intellectual property not being protected. Now, that's particularly important for an advanced economy like ours, where that's one of our competitive advantages, is we've got great engineers, great entrepreneurs, we're designing extraordinary new products. And if they get no protection, and the next thing you know, 's operating as a low-cost producer and not paying any fees or revenues to folks who invented these products, that's a problem.So those are two examples, but there are a number of others. These practices aren't secret. I think everybody understands that they've been going on for quite some time. Sometimes, American companies are wary about bringing them up because they don't want to be punished in terms of their ability to do business in . But I don't have that same concern, so I bring it up.And in terms of enforcement, the other thing that we've been doing is actually trying to enforce the trade laws that are in place. We've brought a number of cases. One that the U.S. press may be familiar with are the cases involving U.S. tires, where we brought very aggressive actions against and won. And as a consequence, U.S. producers are in a better position, and that means more U.S. jobs.So I think we can benefit from trade with . And I want certainly to continue cultivating a constructive relationship with the Chinese Government, but we're going to continue to be firm in insisting that they operate by the same rules that everybody else operates under. We don't want them taking advantage of the United States or U.S. businesses.Jake Tapper [ABC News].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat punitive actions is your administration willing to take if China does not play by the rules?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

And it's positive because I think it's going to be important for the i people who have been suffering a lot to hear from other countries in the world that say: We embrace your courage; we embrace your willingness to take risk for freedom.

Thank you, President Duda. Clearly, you said you asked President Trump if he would consider a permanent base in Poland, and of course, that also relates to Russia. What would you say\u2014how did the President respond to your position to have a permanent base from America in Poland?And then, also, do you currently have concerns over the U.S.-Russia relationship?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, of course. Of course, I told Mr. President about all the aspects connected with the permanent presence of the U.S. Armed Forces in Poland. But, first and foremost, I assured Mr. President of one thing. First and foremost, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot say that, if there are permanent bases of the U.S. Armed Forces in Poland, we will see a deterioration of security because that will lead to an increase in Russian activity and increased militarization of this part of Europe by Russia.I want to say it clearly, ladies and gentlemen: A very strong militarization of, for instance, Kaliningrad Oblast has taken place for more than 10 years now. It is the reality that we're living today. As far aggressive Russian behavior is concerned, as far as increased military activities concerned, including increasing of the militarization, Russia has been conducting such activities in a systematic way. And for the first time, we were able to see that in a materialized way in Georgia. In 2008, when the then-President of Poland, Professor Lech Kaczynski, took other European leaders, and they went to Tbilisi to stop Russian tanks, which were about to attack the capital of Georgia. And from that moment, that military expansion has been developing.It's another leg was the attack on Ukraine. And today we can see an illegal annexation of Crimea. Today, we are witnessing constant violation of international law in the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. So these are today political and military facts of Europe, and the presence of the United States is only providing a guarantee of security and a possibility to defend.Because let me reiterate again: It is only about the guarantee of security and defense of our part of Europe that is the free world. This is the most crucial issue right now from our perspective, from the perspective of Central and Eastern European countries. And we are speaking in one voice on this one, generally.That is why we wanted to ensure the presence of the United States Armed Forces, and also, we wanted to have the presence of NATO forces in our part of Europe as well. And of course, Mr. President and his staff, his advisers, and also the Pentagon staff, have to consider all these issues, but there is a whole range of arguments which are in favor of the fact that the presence of the U.S. Armed Forces in this area is absolutely justified today. That is due to the protection of the interests of the United States as well.So I'm absolutely convinced of this one, because today, unfortunately, we are seeing international law being violated. Today, we are seeing aggressive behaviors, and I am convinced that there is no more effective method of preventing a war than a decisive stance demonstrating that we are ready any moment to repel a possible attack. And presence also means deterrence. At the same time, I am convinced that when we are\u2014when we have a strong military presence in this part of Europe where there is a potential threat, then there will be no war happening ever. And I think it should be pointed out that the President also said, and he also said it publicly, that he would pay the United States\u2014meaning Poland would be paying billions of dollars for a base. And we're looking at that more and more from the standpoint of defending really wealthy countries and not being reimbursed, paid.It's one thing when we defend countries that can't defend themselves and their great people. And we should help them; we don't expect anything for that. But when we're defending immensely wealthy countries and they're not paying for the defense to the United States, they're only taking advantage of us. And we are in discussions with numerous countries, all of whom you know, about payment. Payment. And we get along with them very well, but it's not fair. That includes NATO.As you know, I got $44 billion additional last year, where they paid an additional\u2014you can speak to Secretary General Stoltenberg, who is the head of NATO, and he said he's never seen anything like it. And this year we did even better.But when a country is very wealthy, and when the United States has been protecting them for many years at tremendous cost\u2014cost like nobody in this room would believe\u2014it's time that they help with, we call it burden-sharing. And they will do that.But the President offered us much more than $2 billion to do this, and so we're looking at it. We're looking at it from the standpoint of, number one, military protection for both countries, and also cost, a term you don't hear too often and you haven't heard too often over the last 25 years. But that's the way it has to be.Thank you very much.

Thank you, Mr. President. I want to ask you about Iran. The Israeli Prime Minister just gave a speech very critical of their nuclear program. I wanted to ask if you have made up your mind to pull out of that deal. And if you do pull out of that deal, do you think\u2014are you worried that it sends the wrong message to North Korea, as you seek to enter nuclear talks with Kim Jong Un?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNo, I think it sends the right message. You know, in 7 years that deal will have expired and Iran is free to go ahead and create nuclear weapons. That's not acceptable. Seven years is tomorrow. That's not acceptable.So no, if anything, it's proven right what Israel has done today with the news conference. And Prime Minister Netanyahu just gave a very\u2014I don't know if everybody has seen it, but I got to see a little bit of it. And that is just not an acceptable situation. And I've been saying that's happening. They're not sitting back idly. They're setting off missiles, which they say are for television purposes. I don't think so.So we'll see what happens. I'm not telling you what I'm doing, but a lot of people think they know. And on or before the 12th, we'll make a decision. That doesn't mean we won't negotiate a real agreement. You know, this is an agreement that wasn't approved by too many people. And it's a horrible agreement for the United States, including the fact, Mr. President, that we gave Iran $150 billion and $1.8 billion in cash\u2014Nigeria would like some of that\u2014$1.8 billion in cash and $150 billion. You know what we got? We got nothing. We got nothing.So that doesn't mean I wouldn't negotiate a new agreement. We'll see what happens. But I think, if anything, what's happening today and what's happened over the last little while and what we've learned, has really shown that I've been 100 percent right.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAre you worried that it sends the wrong message to North Korea?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. My question is on Iraq. Mr. President, this morning you talked at length about Afghanistan, Iran, but not Iraq. And I wanted to ask both of you, is France reconciled with the United States as the United States is reconciled with France? So what about Iraq? Can France, for instance, help to get out of the Iraqi quagmire? And President Bush, where do you stand on Iraq and your domestic debate on Iraq? Do you have a timetable for withdrawing troops?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes. I don't\u2014you know, quagmire is an interesting word. If you lived in Iraq and had lived under a tyranny, you'd be saying, God, I love freedom. Because that's what's happened. And there are killers and radicals and murderers who kill the innocent to stop the advance of freedom. But freedom is happening in Iraq, and we're making progress.And I can't thank the President enough for sending his Foreign Minister to Baghdad. It was a clear message that freedom matters, that when people are struggling to live in freedom, that those of us who have the comfort of a free society ought to help them.We had a difference of opinion with your great country over whether or not I should have used military force to enforce U.N. demands. I reminded a TV reporter\u2014I don't know if the person is here or not\u2014 but I said, I just want to remind you that 1441 was supported by France and the United States, which clearly said to the dictator, you will disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences. Now, I'm the kind of person that when somebody says something, I take them for their word.Having said that, we had a difference of opinion. But I don't sense any difference of opinion now that a struggling democracy wants help from those of us who live in the comfort of free societies. And, Mr. President, the strong gesture of sending your Foreign Minister there wasn't a message to the United States, because we're good friends; it was message to the Iraqi citizens that said: We hear your cries for freedom; we want you to succeed, because one of the lessons of history is, free societies yield peace.And so I appreciate your leadership on that issue, and I want to thank your Foreign Minister for\u2014I don't see your Foreign Minister. Look, the guy was here. [] Oh, there he is, yes, next to\u2014look, the President was blocking\u2014next to Madam Rice. Anyway, thank you, sir. Allow me to give you two answers in one.

You cannot combat extremism using the same methods as extremists, and it is very important, it is of the essence that organize elections. I, like President Bush, I wish this to take place as speedily as possible.Let me remind you that this is a country of 150 million inhabitants who happens to have nuclear weapons. This is very important for us that one day we shouldn't wake up with a government, an administration in which is in the hands of the extremists. And we should, each and every one of us, think about this, of the principles, the values that we uphold and that we defend and we must continue to uphold. And then there's the complexity, as it were, in the field. That's why it's important to convene election, call elections.Now, on Iraq, Bernard Kouchner's trip to Iraq was very successful. What does France want? A united Iraq. No one\u2014no, it is in no one's interest to see Iraq dismantled. We want a democratic Iraq. We want a diverse Iraq, where each component element of Iraqi society has learned to live with others; an Iraq which is\u2014which can administer and govern itself and that has the means of ensuring the peace and security of every one of its citizens. And that is exactly Bernard Kouchner's message when he went to Iraq. And this is in the interest of one and all that it be thus, and that position is the position I will defend until the end.

Thank you, Mr. President. On Afghanistan, you're seeking increased commitments from NATO. There are been\u2014have been some new pledges. Are they enough? How many figures\u2014how many troops are needed? Are you satisfied with the pledges, and what are the consequences if those pledges fall short?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWe expect our NATO allies to shoulder the burden necessary to succeed. And to this end, as you know, I've committed 3,200\u20143,500 additional marines to send a clear signal that we're willing to do our part.I was very pleased to listen to the comments of President Sarkozy, where he indicated his willingness to increase troop presence. Other nations have agreed to step up, including Romania. And so we'll see how it goes. That's what summits are for. Summits are for opportunities for people to make clear their intentions about how they intend to support this very important mission.And obviously, I am grateful for any nation that contributes troops to Afghanistan, as are the Afghan people. And clearly some nations are more capable than others of\u2014 in sending troops into combat, into harm's way. We fully understand the politics that prohibit some nations from contributing, but nations need to take this mission seriously because it's in our mutual interests. It's in our interest, of course, to help young democracies survive. But in this case, it's in our interest to help succeed, because we don't want an enemy that has been known to attack people\u2014nations in our alliance\u2014to be able to develop safe haven again, to be able to use a launching pad like Afghanistan to plot, plan, and attack.So this is a vital mission. And it's hard work. It's a tough mission. And our allies have got to understand it's hard. Taking democracy out of the rubble of this\u2014of the Taliban is hard to do, just like it is in Iraq. So the question nations have to ask: Is it worth it? And my answer is, absolutely, it's worth it\u2014and so is the President\u2014it's worth it for our own security, and it's worth it for the cause of peace. Thank you. Regarding Afghanistan, we have a main idea that any lack of success of the NATO in Afghanistan will diminish dramatically the credibility of our organization. And for the time being, the civilized world don't have alternatives to the security than NATO. We have to do everything what we can in order to make a success in our action in Afghanistan: granting democratic development of the country, economic development of the country, security of the country, and eliminating the terrorist risks which are generated by this region. Sure, we have a extremely clear idea if we don't keep the terrorists in Afghanistan. If we will let them free, they'll come in Europe, they'll come in United States. For this reason, we have to win; we have to obtain the victory in Afghanistan.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow many figures?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Could you tell us what you're planning to do in the Executive order and your reaction to what happened in the Senate?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, the Senate Republicans want very much to pass a bill on police reform. We have total cooperation with many different communities, including the police community. They want it very much to happen themselves, because there are things that they agreed to that they would like to agree to, and they would love to have it agreed to formally.The Democrats don't want to do it, because they want to weaken our police. They want to take away immunity. They want to do other things that you know about as well as anybody in this beautiful field that we sit. They want to take away a lot of the strength from our police and from law enforcement, generally, and we can't live with that. We can't live with that.This is a great bill, strongly endorsed by, as you know, Tim Scott, who's terrific, who is a terrific man, great Senator\u2014South Carolina. And Mitch wants it to happen. I would like to see it happen. But we won't sacrifice. We won't do that. We won't do anything that's going to hurt our police.The police\u2014you know, we have a record this year on crime\u2014a record positive rating on crime this year, the best. And you hear about certain places like Chicago, and you hear about what's going on in Detroit and other cities, all Democrat run. Every one of them is Democrat run. Twenty out of 20. The 20 worst, the 20 most dangerous are Democrat run. We have one city or two cities in particular\u2014worse than Honduras, worse than Afghanistan. Worse than Afghanistan.And these are cities within the United States, Democrat run, radical-left run. You see what's going on in Seattle. You see what's going on in other places. Seattle, of all places\u2014who would even think that's possible? Twenty out of 20. The Democrats want to weaken very substantially our law enforcement and our police. And, frankly, they want to defund, largely\u2014at least largely. There are some that want to defund and abolish our police, if you can believe that, and we're not letting that happen.So if nothing happens with it, it's one of those things\u2014we have different philosophies. They want open borders. They want sanctuary cities. We don't.As far as your number\u2014your second question, I think that we're going to have a very strong Executive order, but we already have very strong. We have the monuments act already, which\u2014which means 10 years in jail. But I think we're going to consolidate various things. We're going to come out with a very strong Executive order, and I should have that by the end of the week, which is fast approaching. We're going to have it very\u2014a very powerful statement.We've arrested numerous people, as you know, for what took place outside of Washington. In addition, the FBI is investigating hundreds of people throughout the country for what they've done to monuments, statues, and even buildings.So we have very strong laws already in the books, and we have a law that's 10 years. It's 10 years. That's a long time to have fun 1 night. I think many of the people that are knocking down these statues don't even have any idea what the statue is, what it means, who it is, when they knock down Grant\u2014when they want to knock down Grant. But when they look at certain\u2014now they're looking at Jesus Christ. They're looking at George Washington. They're looking at Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson. Not going to happen. Not going to happen. Not as long as I'm here.As far as Democrats are concerned, I think they could care less whether or not it happens. And I think the American people get it. So we're going to have a very strong Executive order, and it'll happen very quickly, before the end of the week.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat is the President's reaction to what happened in the Senate?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. I want to ask you about tomorrow, the next leg of your trip, a little bit. And tomorrow you're going to be meeting for the first time with President Duterte, and he's a leader whose war on drugs has led to the death of about 2,400 people in just the last 2 months since he took office. And today he said in a very colorful way that you'd better not bring this up. And I'm wondering, are you committed to raising this with President Duterte? And are you concerned that meeting him legitimizes his approach on this issue?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nGood. Well, I just came out of a long day of meetings\u2014[]\u2014so I just heard about some of this. But I have seen some of those colorful statements in the past, and so clearly, he's a colorful guy. [] And what I've instructed my team to do is to talk to their Philippine counterparts to find out, is this, in fact, a time where we can have some constructive, productive conversations? Obviously, the Filipino people are some of our closest friends and allies, and the Philippines is a treaty ally of ours. But I always want to make sure that if I'm having a meeting, that it's actually productive and we're getting something done.We recognize the significant burden that the drug trade plays just not just in the Philippines, but around the world. And fighting narcotrafficking is tough. But we will always assert the need to have due process and to engage in that fight against drugs in a way that's consistent with basic international norms. And so, undoubtedly, if and when we have a meeting, that this is something that's going to be brought up, and my expectation, my hope is, is that it could be dealt with constructively.But I'll have my team discuss this. I've got a whole bunch of folks that I'm going to be meeting with over the course of the next several days. And as I said, historically, our relationship with the Philippines is one of our most important, and my relationship with the Philippine people has been extraordinarily warm and productive. So I expect that will continue. But I want to make sure that the setting is right and the timing is right for us to have the best conversation possible.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nMeeting with President Duterte\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

President Putin, did you want President Trump to win the election? And did you direct any of your officials to help him do that? President Putin. Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the U.S.-Russia relationship back to normal.I think there can be three questions from the Russian pool.Russia Today, you have the floor.Israel/Syria/Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Terrorist Organization [The reporter spoke in Russian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.] Q. Thank you so much. And good evening to everyone. My name is Ilya Petrenko, RT TV Channel.[The reporter spoke in English as follows.] Q. First question for Mr. Trump, in English. Mr. President, would you please go into the details of possibly any specific arrangements for the U.S. to work together with Russia in Syria, if any of these kind of arrangements were made today or discussed?[The reporter spoke in Russian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.] Q. And my question to President Putin, in Russian: Since we brought up the issue of football several times, I ask\u2014I use the football language. Mr. Pompeo mentioned that, when we talk about the Syrian cooperation, the ball is in the Syrian court. Mr. Putin\u2014in the Russian court\u2014is it true? And how would you use this fact, the having the ball?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I guess I'll answer the first part of the question We've worked with Israel long and hard for many years, many decades I think we've never\u2014never has anyone, any country been closer than we are President Putin also is helping Israel And we both spoke with Bibi Netanyahu, and they would like to do certain things with respect to Syria having to do with the safety of Israel So in that respect, we absolutely would like to work in order to help Israel, and Israel will be working with us So both countries would work jointlyAnd I think that, when you look at all of the progress that's been made in certain sections with the eradication of ISIS\u2014we're about 98 percent, 99 percent there\u2014and other things that have taken place that we've done, and that, frankly, Russia has helped us with in certain respects But I think that working with Israel is a great thing, and creating safety for Israel is something that both President Putin and I would like to see very muchOne little thing I might add to that is the helping of people\u2014helping of people Because you have such horrible, if you see\u2014and I've seen reports and I've seen pictures, I've seen just about everything And if we can do something to help the people of Syria get back into some form of shelter and\u2014on a humanitarian basis And that's what the word was, really, a humanitarian basis I think that both of us would be very interested in doing that, and we are We will do thatThank you very muchRussia-US Military Coordination\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nSince we brought up the issue of football several times, I ask\u2014I use the football language.

Thank you, Mr. President. I want to follow up on your comments about NAFTA. The Democratic Presidential candidates, in fact, are talking about renegotiating that trade agreement if elected. I'm wondering if you're worried that their comments on the campaign trail are perhaps overshadowing your protrade agenda. In essence, do you worry that you're losing the free trade debate in the courts of public opinion?And to President Calderon and Prime Minister Harper, I'd like to get your thoughts about expanding your trade relationship with the United States. Is there a point at which you shift attention to the people running for the White House and their views and try to reach out to them?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nActually, my biggest concern on trade right now is with Colombia. NAFTA exists, and NAFTA\u2014when you analyze it in an objective way, it benefits\u2014 beneficial to America. It also happens to be beneficial to Mexico and Canada, which makes it a, you know, a very good, comprehensive agreement.It's beneficial to us because when you're able to export to your neighborhood, it helps create jobs. Jobs are created when people find outlets for their goods and services. We have found a lot of outlets for our goods and services with our\u2014in our neighborhood. It also helps consumers when you import. In other words, the more choices consumers have, the more options they have, the more\u2014less likely it is there will be price increases, and it's better for your consumers. This agreement's been beneficial in creating wealth in our neighborhood. Our economies have all grown.I also happen to think it's very important for our citizens. I wish people could remember what the border looked like between Texas and Mexico before NAFTA. I mean, it was poor, really poor, on both sides of the border. If you go down there today, there's prosperity on both sides of the border, and that's in our Nation's interests.I mean, one way to increase pressure on the border is to\u2014if you do it\u2014away with NAFTA, there's going to be a lot of Mexicans\u2014more Mexicans out of work. It will make it harder on the border. It will make it harder to deal with. So people who say, Let's get rid of NAFTA, because of a throwaway political line, must understand this has been good for America, and it's also been good for Mexico and Canada, and that's what you want in your neighborhood.Secondly, my biggest concern is to turn our back on our friends in Colombia. The Speaker of the House made a decision, using an extraordinary procedure, to prevent a vote on a trade bill that had been negotiated in good faith between our respective countries. You heard the\u2014President Calderon say, it's in the region's interest to trade freely and fairly. Well, this agreement we have with Colombia right now is not fair for America, it's not fair for our businesses, it's not fair for our farmers. And all I'm asking the Congress is to make it fair.And if they\u2014if the Speaker doesn't bring\u2014give us a date certain on the bill, she's effectively killed it. It's her responsibility, and she's going to have to explain why the voices of false populism have been strengthened, why anti-Americanism could flourish, when America turns its back on a strong leader like President Uribe and a friend for democracy like President Uribe.I'm concerned about protectionism in America. It's not in our interests to become a protectionist nation. And so I'll continue to speak out on it and assure our friends that we will work hard to explain to the people the benefits of why free and fair trade is in our Nation's interest. First of all, what we have to do\u2014all of us who have responsibilities vis-a-vis our citizens\u2014is to objectively study the facts. What's happened with NAFTA in our three countries? Before NAFTA, there were many businesses, Mexican businesses, that were afraid, and they alleged that it was impossible to compete with the sophisticated and modern U.S. companies. And they weren't going to survive. There were also many U.S. companies who thought it was impossible to compete in more open markets. Now, what was the result? The result has been that trade has grown, and that has led to gains for everyone involved.Contrary to what they believe\u2014that one was going to win, the other would lose\u2014 it was a win-win situation, and NAFTA has benefited the three countries. Trade has grown in all three, jobs have grown in all three, and even wage levels have gone up in all three. Today, the economies of Canada, Mexico, and the United States are bigger and stronger than they were 14 years ago. Income per capita for all three has also grown compared to 14 years ago. The benefits are visible, and all you need to do is to talk based on demonstrated results.To talk about taking a step backwards, in terms of free trade in the case of Mexico, would effectively provoke considerable damage on the economy. And another factor I was discussing yesterday with President Bush\u2014that he reiterated today, and I will reiterate as well\u2014would be a sudden loss of economic opportunities that would even lead to even greater migratory pressure in the\u2014against\u2014with the United States.We are doing everything we can in order to create job opportunities in Mexico for people so that Mexicans will not need to seek job opportunities outside their country. And the only way to do it is by creating jobs in Mexico, and the only way is, precisely, multiplying our possibilities of trade.In the case of the U.S. economy, if you were to take a step backwards with regard to NAFTA or free trade, you would be condemning Americans to have one of the least competitive economies in the developed world. While other parts of the world are accelerating their growth, their integration\u2014China, Japan, India, Asia\u2014in order to have more competitive economies and more complementary situations\u2014and Europe is already becoming a single trade group, and they're adding more and more countries to that bloc every year\u2014here you see protectionist voices arising. And the only thing they would achieve, if they were to prosper, would be to condemn North America as a region to complete backwardness in today's world. And that is the worst possible solution you can provide to your citizens.It is not my role to talk to the three candidates or precandidates to the Presidency. I'm very respectful of the domestic politics of this country. This is a decision that is solely in the hands of U.S. citizens. And for that reason, I must respect that process completely. It is not my role to talk to any candidates or precandidates. All I would do is speak to the person who will eventually be the President of the United States. And we will speak openly and sincerely about the future of both of our countries or, in this case, our three countries in the trilateral meetings that we hold.But Mexico will have a respectful relationship with the next President of the United States and will always seek the prosperity of our nations, knowing that through free trade, we have a clear, open, and respectful relationship among all our countries that will achieve prosperity.If we want to solve common problems, if we want to solve problems like security, problems like immigration, problems like economic growth in the United States and in Mexico, we need to understand that only to the extent that North America is more competitive as a region, only to that extent will we be able to successfully face our problems. We have been working with the current U.S. administration. We've had a very productive relationship with President Bush and his administration. And I trust that this will continue, that it will continue with any of the Presidential candidates here in the United States.Of course, it's the United States who needs to make a decision about this election. But I think that in the end, Canada really is confident that the next President will also understand the importance of NAFTA and the importance of the commercial relationship between the United States and Canada.

That energy security is more important now than it was 20 years ago, when NAFTA was negotiated, and will be even more important in the future.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nExpanding trade relationship with the United States and reaching out to Presidential candidates.\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. One of the most significant events of this year was the revelation of the surveillance by the National Security Agency. As you review how to rein in the National Security Agency, a Federal judge said that, for example, the Government had failed to cite a single instance in which analysis of the NSA's bulk metadata actually stopped an imminent attack. Are you able to identify any specific examples when it did so? Are you convinced that the collection of that data is useful to national security and should continue as it is?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nLet me talk more broadly, and then I'll talk specifically about the program you are referring to.As you know, the independent panel that I put together came back with a series of recommendations, 46 in total. I had an extensive meeting with them down in the Situation Room to review all the recommendations that they had made. I want to thank them publicly, because I think they did an excellent job and took my charge very seriously, which is, I told them, I want you to look from top to bottom at what we're doing and evaluate whether or not the current structures that we have and the current programs that we have are properly addressing both our continuing need to keep ourselves secure and to prevent terrorist attacks or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or other threats to the homeland? And are we also making sure that we're taking seriously rule of law and our concerns about privacy and civil liberties?So what we're doing now is evaluating all the recommendations that have been made. Over the next several weeks, I'm going to assess based on conversations not just with the intelligence community, but others in Government and outside of Government, how we might apply and incorporate their recommendations. And I'm going to make a pretty definitive statement about all of this in January, where I'll be able to say: here are the recommendations that we think make sense; here are ones that we think are promising, but still need to be refined further; here's how it relates to the work we're doing not just internally, but also in partnership with other countries. And so I'm taking this very seriously because I think, as I've said before, this is a debate that needed to be had.One specific program, the 215 program, is the metadata, the bulk collection of phone numbers and exchanges that have taken place, that has probably gotten the most attention, at least with respect to domestic audiences. And what I've said in the past continues to be the case, which is that the NSA, in executing this program, believed, based on experiences from 9/11, that it was important for us to be able to track if there was a phone number of a known terrorist outside of the United States calling into the United States, where that call might have gone, and that having that data in one place and retained for a certain period of time allowed them to be confident in pursuing various investigations of terrorist threats.And I think it's important to note that in all the reviews of this program that have been done, in fact, there have not been actual instances where it's been alleged that the NSA in some ways acted inappropriately in the use of this data. But what is also clear is, from the public debate, people are concerned about the prospect, the possibility, of abuse. And I think that's what the judge and the district court suggested. And although his opinion obviously differs from rulings on the FISA Court, we're taking those into account.The question we're going to have to ask is, can we accomplish the same goals that this program is intended to accomplish in ways that give the public more confidence that, in fact, the NSA is doing what it's supposed to be doing? I have confidence in the fact that the NSA is not engaging in domestic surveillance or snooping around, but I also recognize that as technologies change and people can start running algorithms and programs that map out all the information that we're downloading on a daily basis into our telephones and our computers, that we may have to refine this further to give people more confidence. And I'm going to be working very hard on doing that.And we've got to provide more confidence to the international community. In some ways, what has been more challenging is the fact that we do have a lot of laws and checks and balances and safeguards and audits when it comes to making sure that the NSA and other intelligence agencies are not spying on Americans. We've had less legal constraint in terms of what we're doing internationally. But I think part of what's been interesting about this whole exercise is recognizing that in a virtual world, some of these boundaries don't matter anymore, and just because we can do something doesn't mean we necessarily should. And the values that we've got as Americans are ones that we have to be willing to apply beyond our borders, I think, perhaps more systematically than we've done in the past.Okay?

Did you receive assurances from Chancellor Scholz today that Germany will, in fact, pull the plug on this project if Russia invades Ukraine? And did you discuss what the definition of invasion could be?And then, Chancellor Scholz\u2014\u2014[At this point, the reporter spoke in German, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]If I may ask you, Chancellor Scholz\u2014you said there was some strategic ambiguity that was needed in terms of sanctions.

Thank you, Mr. President. On the economic package that you rolled out earlier this week, first on the business tax cuts. Why did you wait until this superheated campaign season to roll it out? A lot of your critics and even some Democrats say, well, clearly he's just using this for political purposes, he doesn't have any expectation it's actually going to be passed, it's a political weapon. Why did you wait so long to bring that out?And on the stimulus part, we can't get people in the White House to say it is a stimulus--$50 billion for roads and other infrastructure, but they avoid the word stimulus like the plague. Is that because the original stimulus is so deeply unpopular? And if so, why is it so unpopular?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, let me go back to when I first came into office. We had an immediate task, which was to rescue an economy that was tipping over a cliff. And we put in place an economic plan that 95 percent of economists say substantially helped us avoid a depression.A third of those were tax cuts, by the way. A third of that economic plan was tax cuts for individuals and for small businesses. So we haven't--this notion that we waited until now to put forward a series of plans, Chip, we've--just on the small-business issue alone, we have cut taxes for small businesses eight times during the course of the last 18 months. So we're hardly Johnny-come-latelies on this issue.Now, when you put all the things we've done together, it has made a difference. Three million people have jobs that wouldn't have them otherwise had we not taken these steps. The economy would be in much worse shape. But as I said before, we're not where we need to go yet, which means that if we're not there yet, what else can we do?And the proposals that we've put forward are ones that historically, again, have garnered bipartisan support: a research and development tax credit so that companies that are investing in research here in the United States, which is part of what's going to keep us growing and keep us innovative, let's make sure that companies are strongly incentivized to do that; making sure that their expensing accelerated business depreciation is happening in 2011 so that if companies are sort of sitting on the sidelines right now, not sure whether they should invest, let's give them incentive to go ahead and invest now to give that a jumpstart.On infrastructure, we've got a highway bill that traditionally is done every 6 years. And what we're saying is, let's ramp up what we're doing, let's beef it up a little bit, because we've got this infrastructure all across the country that everybody from Governors to mayors to economists to engineers of all political stripes have said is holding us back in terms of our long-term competitiveness. Let's get started now rebuilding America.And in terms of paying for some of these things, let's stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Let's stop incentivizing that. Let's give tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in the United States of America.Those are all commonsense approaches. Historically, as you know--you've been around this town for a long time--usually, Republicans and Democrats agree on infrastructure. Usually, Republicans and Democrats agree on making sure that research and development investments are made right here in the United States. And so let's get it done.It has nothing to do with the notion that somehow what we did previously didn't work. It worked. It just hasn't done as much as we need it to do. We've still got a long ways to go, and we're going to keep on doing it.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAnd on the stimulus part, we can't get people in the White House to say it is a stimulus--$50 billion for roads and other infrastructure, but they avoid the word stimulus like the plague.

Congress has got all the right to appropriate money. But the idea of telling our military how to conduct operations, for example, or how to deal with troop strength is\u2014I don't think it makes sense. I don't think it makes sense today, nor do I think it's a good precedent for the future.

Your visit is coming to an end now\u2014this is a question for President George Bush: At the end of your visit, sir, have you found allies in order to place a counterweight to the initiatives of Hugo Chavez? What commitments did Felipe Calderon take on in order to be a counterweight to these initiatives of Hugo Chavez, on the one hand?And on the other hand, President Felipe Calderon, Foreign Minister Patricia has said that you are working in order to strengthen the relationship with Venezuela. How is this compatible with the commitments that you're taking on with President Bush in order to give thrust to this counterweight in Latin America concerning Hugo Chavez?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThank you for the question. We spent a lot of time talking about Mexico's role in the world. Mexico is a respected nation; President Calderon is a respected leader. But our conversations focused on democracy and rule of law and prosperity and how to improve the lives of our fellow citizens. We spent time talking about social justice and concern for the poor.One of the reasons I've come down here again is to remind people in this important part of the world that the United States cares deeply about the human condition; that we spent 1.6 billion of bilateral aid last year, most of the money going to social justice programs. And that doesn't include programs like the one I saw in the highlands of Guatemala, where our military was providing basic health care for citizens.So, Mr. President and I spent time talking about how to advance a hopeful agenda, one that will lift the spirits of people. And I respect the role Mexico plays. I mean, Mexico will lead diplomatic efforts for the common security and common prosperity, and that's an important role. The commitment and purpose of my Government is to have constructive, positive, and sound relations with all countries of the world and, of course, with the countries of Latin America, without exception. And certainly the more\u2014the most important relationship with Mexico abroad is the one that we have with the United States, due to the migration that exists, the flows through the borders, and all else that you are well aware of.However, Mexico is respectful of the opinions of other leaders. We are respectful of the heads of states of other countries, such as Venezuela and certainly the United States. We are a government that has principles and values, values such as democracy, freedom, liberty, and legality and certainly security and safety.On the other hand, not as a strategy\u2014 this was not something that we focused on as a strategy in our talks, but as a conviction of our government. Mexico has to play a role which is balanced, weighed, and it has to be a leader in Latin America, in agreement with its culture, its history, its economy, its people.We are deeply Latin American, and we, too, want justice, development, democracy for all of Latin America. That is where we are engaged, and we are committed. We certainly do agree and coincide with other countries, many countries, of course, who coincide and agree with those principles.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat commitments did Felipe Calderon take on in order to be a counterweight to these initiatives of Hugo Chavez, on the one hand?

He wasn't stating policy.So let me be clear again about what our policy as determined by me, the President of the United States, is towards the situation there. I believe that Qadhafi is on the wrong side of history. I believe that the Libyan people are anxious for freedom and the removal of somebody who has suppressed them for decades now. And we are going to be in contact with the opposition, as well as in consultation with the international community, to try to achieve the goal of Mr. Qadhafi being removed from power.Zachary Goldfarb [Washington Post].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhether James Clapper needs to be reprimanded for his statement.\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

[Inaudible]\u2014Polish Press Agency. I've got a question to President Trump. Do you share the conviction, which we have just heard a minute ago expressed by President Duda, concerning the threat which is posed to the region, but not only to the region, by Russia? And do you also share the view that permanent American bases in Poland are justified not only due to the security of the countries in our region, but also due to the security of the United States?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI do. I actually do. I think it's a very aggressive situation. I think Russia has acted aggressively. They respect force. They respect strength, as anyone does. And we have the greatest strength in the world\u2014especially now. We were being depleted under the last administration. We had planes that were old and tired and didn't fly, in some cases. They were getting used parts. This is the United States; it doesn't happen. We make the greatest planes in the world and missiles in the world.And we have enhanced, to put it mildly, our military. It's literally being rebuilt, as we speak, with literally hundreds and hundreds of planes and missiles, and everything that you can imagine. They never had it so good, because I got, in Congress, $700 billion this year; $716 billion last year. That's far more than they ever anticipated.I viewed it two ways. Number one, military\u2014because it's always more important than anything else, including jobs. But number two is jobs. We make everything here. So it's hundreds of thousands of jobs to make for us the best military in the world. And Russia respects that. They respect that. So I am with the President. I feel that he's right. And I feel that, look, you look at the history of Poland and Russia, that's a long and very complicated history. So he certainly has a right to feel that way.

I get a big, big kick out of that.But we are doing very well. I think that something very dramatic could happen. They're treating us with great respect.

Thanks, Mr. President. Germany has said that Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader, was poisoned. What do you think should be done to Russia about that? And what is your message to Russia about that? And how should the international community and the United States respond?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I think we have to look at it very seriously if that's the case, and I think we will. There's nobody been tougher on Russia than I have. We get along. I get along with almost all countries.I get along with North Korea. Remember? We were supposed to be going to war with North Korea. If Hillary got elected, you'd be at war right now with North Korea. That would be a very messy war, a very bad war. Many millions of people would be killed. In the meantime, we've gotten along with them. We didn't get to war. Everyone said that if I was elected, I'd be at war in 1 week; it's been just the opposite.We're doing very well in Afghanistan, bringing the troops down\u2014very low level\u2014and other things are happening. Very interestingly, we have a great peace deal going on in the Middle East, actually, with U.A.E. and Israel. And that's been received like, probably, very few things that many people have done. It's been very well received. And we'll be having other countries announcing soon; they're joining that, and you're going to have a lot of countries in that. A lot of countries are saying, Hey, why didn't you bring us in right from the beginning? They would have loved to have been there, but they want to be in.So we're doing a lot of things. I think that I was the one that alerted the United States and the world: Nord Stream 2. I said: Why is Germany spending billions and billions of dollars to Russia to get their energy from Russia, and then we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia? What's that all about? And the sanctions and everything else.At the same time, with Russia, we're right now negotiating a nuclear nonproliferation treaty, which is very important. It's a very important thing. To me, it's the most important thing. Some people say global warming; I don't. I say this is far more important. And we are the biggest; they are the second biggest, nuclear-wise. China is third. They're actually a distant third, but they're building pretty rapidly. And at some point, we'll include China into those talks, but we're doing very well with Russia on nuclear nonproliferation.So I don't know exactly what happened. I think it's tragic. It's terrible. It shouldn't happen. We haven't had any proof yet, but I will take a look.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat do you think should be done to Russia about the poisoning of Alexei Navalny?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

You've agreed to talk to Syria in the context of the international conferences on Iraq. What's so different or wrong about Speaker Pelosi having her own meetings there?

And by that, I mean, photo opportunities and/or meetings with President Asad lead the Asad Government to believe they're part of the mainstream of the international community, when, in fact, they're a state sponsor of terror; when, in fact, they're helping expedite\u2014or at least not stopping the movement of foreign fighters from into Iraq; when, in fact, they have done little to nothing to rein in militant Hamas and Hizballah; and when, in fact, they destabilize the Lebanese democracy.There have been a lot of people who have gone to see President Asad\u2014some Americans, but a lot of European leaders, high-ranking officials. And yet we haven't seen action; in other words, he hasn't responded. It's one thing to send a message, it's another thing to have the person receiving the message actually do something. So the position of this administration is that the best way to meet with a leader like Asad or people from is in the larger context of trying to get the global community to help change his behavior. But sending delegations hasn't worked. It's just simply been counterproductive.Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAre you worried that she might be preempting your own efforts?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

The operations in Africa this weekend suggest that the continent is now the central front in the campaign against terrorism, and if we're going to see U.S. military operations all around the continent, how does that square with your contention that American cannot be at war forever?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, if you look at the speech I gave at the National Defense College several months ago, I outlined how I saw the shift in terrorism around the world and what we have to do to respond to it. And part of what I said is, is that we had decimated core Al aida that had been operating primarily between Afghanistan and Pakistan, but you now had these regional groups, some of which are explicitly tied to Al aida or that ideology, some of which are more localized. Few of them have the ability to project beyond their borders, but they can do a lot of damage inside their borders.And Africa is one of the places where, because, in some cases, a lack of capacity on the part of the Governments, in some cases because it is easier for folks to hide out in vast terrains that are sparsely populated, that you're seeing some of these groups gather. And we're going to have to continue to go after them.But there's a difference between us going after terrorists who are plotting directly to do damage to the United States and us being involved in wars. The risks of terrorism and terrorist networks are going to continue for some time to come. We've got to have a long-term plan that is not just military based, we've got to engage in a war of ideas in the region and engage with Muslim countries and try to isolate radical elements that are doing more damage to Muslims than they're doing to anybody else. We've got to think about economic development, because although there's not a direct correlation between terrorism and the economy, there's no doubt that if you've got a lot of unemployed, uneducated young men in societies, that there's a greater likelihood that terrorist recruits are available.But where you've got active plots and active networks, we're going to go after them. We prefer partnering with countries where this is taking place wherever we can, and we want to build up their capacity. But we're not going to farm out our defense.And I have to say, by the way, the operations that took place both in Libya and Somalia were examples of the extraordinary skill and dedication and talent of our men and women in the armed forces. They do their jobs extremely well, with great precision, at great risk to themselves. And I think they are pretty good examples for how those of us here in Washington should operate as well.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow does the increased U.S. military operations in Africa square with the contention that America cannot be at war forever?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

He wanted to meet today or tomorrow, and I decided that I would not do that. I think that he is\u2014from where I come from\u2014somewhat of a negative force. I think that the people should look to do things correctly as opposed to criticize. I really don't like critics as much as I like and respect people that get things done. So I've decided not to meet.As far as the protests, I have to tell you, because I commented on it yesterday: We left the Prime Minister, the Queen, the Royal Family; there were thousands of people on the streets cheering. And even coming over today, there were thousands of people cheering. And then, I heard that there were protests. I said: Where are the protests? I don't see any protests. I did see a small protest today when I came, very small. So a lot of it is fake news, I hate to say. But you saw the people waving the American flag, waving your flag; it was tremendous spirit and love. There was great love. It was an alliance. And I didn't see the protesters until just a little while ago, and it was a very, very small group of people, put in for political reasons. So it was fake news. Thank you.. And I would say to both the mayor of London and to Jeremy Corbyn: The discussions that we have had today are about the future of this most important relationship between the U.S. and the U.K.As the President described it: the greatest alliance the world has seen. It is this deep, special relationship and partnership between the United States and the United Kingdom that ensures our safety and security, and the safety and security of others around the world too. And it is this relationship that helps to ensure there are jobs that employ people here in the U.K. and in the United States that underpins our prosperity and our future. That is a relationship we should cherish. It is a relationship we should build on. It is a relationship we should be proud of.Mr. President, would you like to\u2014\u2014 It's very big, and this really is a very big and important alliance. And I think people should act positively toward it, because it means so much for both countries. It means so much and it's been so good.Steve Holland [Steve A. Holland, Reuters], yes.

Thank you, Mr. President. Sir, you head back to the United States with the task of convincing the American people and Congress on two major foreign policy initiatives\u2014the framework for a nuclear deal with Iran and, likely soon, the decision to remove Cuba from a list of state sponsors of terror. Recently, remarks by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei have raised doubts among some as to whether that deal can occur in Iran. And Senator Schumer, an ally of yours, has\u2014wants Congress to have the right to vote on removal of sanctions. Presidential politics are likely to play a part in this Cuba decision inevitably. So I'm wondering if it would take a lot of political capital just to get one done, let alone two. Have you bitten off more than you can chew?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNo. [] You may be surprised by that response, Jim. Let me take them in turn.First of all, with respect to Cuba, there is majority support of our policy in the United States, and there's overwhelming support for our policy in Cuba. I think people recognize that if you keep on doing something for 50 years and it doesn't work, you should try something new.And so the American people don't need to be persuaded that this is, in fact, the right thing to do. I recognize that there are still concerns and questions that Congress may have; we've got concerns and questions about specific activities that are taking place in Cuba and human rights and reform. And there were two members of the Cuban civil society that were in attendance at the meeting that I had yesterday who expressed much of what they have to go through on a day-to-day basis. They were supportive of our policy of engagement with Cuba.And so I don't think that it's so much we have to persuade anybody. The issue of the state sponsor of terrorism list, as you know, the State Department has provided a recommendation; it's gone through our interagency process. I'll be honest with you, I have been on the road, and I want to make sure that I have a chance to read it, study it, before we announce publicly what the policy outcome is going to be.But in terms of the overall direction of Cuba policy, I think there is a strong majority both in the United States and in Cuba that says our ability to engage, to open up commerce and travel and people-to-people exchanges is ultimately going to be good for the Cuban people.Now, with respect to Iran, I have always been clear: We are not done yet. What we were able to obtain was a political framework between the P-5-plus-1 nations and Iran that provided unprecedented verification of what is taking place in Iran over the next two decades that significantly cuts back on its centrifuges, that cuts off pathways for it to obtain a nuclear weapon, and that calls for, in return, the rolling back of sanctions in a phased way that allows us to snap back if Iran violates the agreement. That's the political framework. That was not just something that the United States and Iran agreed to, but Iran agreed to a political framework with the other P-5-plus-1 nations.Now, what's always been clear is, is that Iran has its own politics around this issue. They have their own hardliners. They have their own countervailing impulses in terms of whether or not to go forward with something, just as we have in our country. And so it's not surprising to me that the Supreme Leader or a whole bunch of other people are going to try to characterize the deal in a way that protects their political position. But I know what was discussed at\u2014in arriving at the political agreement.What I've always said, though, is that there's the possibility of backsliding. There's the possibility that it doesn't get memorialized in a way that satisfies us that we're able to verify that, in fact, Iran is not getting a nuclear weapon and that we are preserving the capacity to snap back sanctions in the event that they are breaking any deal.And that's why the work is going to be so important between now and the end of June to memorialize this so that we can all examine it. And we don't have to speculate on what the meaning of a deal is going to be. Either there's going to be a document that Iran agrees with the world community about and a series of actions that have to be taken, or there's not. Part of the challenge in this whole process has been, opponents of basically any deal with Iran have constantly tried to characterize what the deal is without seeing it.Now, if we are able to obtain a final deal that comports with the political agreement\u2014and I say if because that's not yet final\u2014then I'm absolutely positive that that is the best way to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. And that's not my opinion; that's the opinion of people like Ernie Moniz, my Secretary of Energy, who is a physicist from MIT and actually knows something about this stuff. That's the opinion of a whole bunch of nuclear experts who examined the deal.I mean, very rarely do you see a consensus\u2014consensus too strong a word\u2014a large majority of people who are experts in the field saying this is actually a realistic, plausible, meaningful approach to cut off the pathways for Iran getting a nuclear weapon and that it is more likely to succeed not only than maintaining current sanctions or additional sanctions, but more likely to succeed than if we took a military approach to solving the problem.Again, that's not uniquely my opinion. That is\u2014talk to the people who are not affiliated with the administration, some of whom were skeptical about our capacity to get a deal done and have now looked at it and said if we're able to actually get what was discussed in the political framework, it's absolutely the right thing to do.Now, there's politics and political pressure inside of the United States. We all know that. The Prime Minister of Israel is deeply opposed to it. I think he's made that very clear. And I have repeatedly asked, what is the alternative that you present that you think makes it less likely for Iran to get a nuclear weapon? And I have yet to obtain a good answer on that.And the narrow question that's going to be presented next week when Congress comes back is, what's Congress's appropriate role in looking at a final deal? And I've talked to not only Bob Corker, but I've talked to Ben Cardin, the ranking member on the Democratic side. And I want to work with them so that Congress can look at this deal when it's done. What I'm concerned about is making sure that we don't prejudge it or those who are opposed to any deal whatsoever try to use a procedural argument essentially to screw up the possibility of a deal.Last comment I'm going to make on this: When I hear some, like Senator McCain recently, suggest that our Secretary of State, John Kerry, who served in the United States Senate, a Vietnam veteran, who's provided exemplary service to this Nation, is somehow less trustworthy in the interpretation of what's in a political agreement than the Supreme Leader of Iran, that's an indication of the degree to which partisanship has crossed all boundaries. And we're seeing this again and again. We saw it with the letter by the 47 Senators who communicated directly\u2014[]\u2014to the Supreme Leader of Iran\u2014the person that they say can't be trusted at all\u2014warning him not to trust the United States Government.We have Mitch McConnell trying to tell the world, oh, don't have confidence in the U.S. Government's abilities to fulfill any climate change pledge that we might make. And now we have a Senator suggesting that our Secretary of State is purposely misinterpreting the deal and giving the Supreme Leader of Iran the benefit of the doubt in the interpretations.That's not how we're supposed to run foreign policy, regardless of who is President or Secretary of State. We can have arguments, and there are legitimate arguments to be had. I understand why people might be mistrustful of Iran. I understand why people might oppose the deal, although the reason is not because this is a bad deal per se, but they just don't trust any deal with Iran and may prefer to take a military approach to it.But when you start getting to the point where you are actively communicating that the United States Government and our Secretary of State is somehow spinning presentations in a negotiation with a foreign power, particularly one that you say is your enemy, that's a problem. It needs to stop.Jim Acosta [CNN].

Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned that the U.S. and its European allies have reached a consensus on extending the sanctions against Russia. Is there a consensus, though, about what specifically the next step should be if Russia continues to violate the Minsk agreement? And also if\u2014can you deter Russian aggression in other parts of Eastern Europe without a permanent U.S. troop presence?And separately, I wanted to ask you about the possibility that the court battle over your actions on immigration could extend late into your term. Do you think that there's anything more that you can do for the people who would have benefited from that program and now are in limbo? And how do you view the possibility of your term ending without accomplishing your goals on immigration?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nOn Ukraine and Russia and Minsk, there is strong consensus that we need to keep pushing Russia to abide by the terms of the Minsk agreement; we need to continue to support and encourage Ukraine to meet its obligations under Minsk; that until that's completed, sanctions remain in place.There was discussion about additional steps that we might need to take if Russia, working through separatists, doubled down on aggression inside of Ukraine. We\u2014those discussions are taking place at a technical level, not yet at a political level, because I think the first goal here going into a European Council meeting that's coming up is just rolling over the existing sanctions. But I think at a technical level, we want to be prepared.Our hope is, is that we don't have to take additional steps because the Minsk agreement is met. And I want to give enormous credit to Chancellor Merkel, along with President Hollande, who have shown extraordinary stick-to-itiveness and patience in trying to get that done.Ultimately, this is going to be an issue for Mr. Putin. He's got to make a decision: Does he continue to wreck his country's economy and continue Russia's isolation in pursuit of a wrongheaded desire to recreate the glories of the Soviet empire, or does he recognize that Russia's greatness does not depend on violating the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other countries?And as I mentioned earlier, the costs that the Russian people are bearing are severe. That's being felt. It may not always be understood why they're suffering, because of state media inside of Russia and propaganda coming out of state media in Russia and to Russian speakers. But the truth of the matter is, is that the Russian people would greatly benefit. And ironically, one of the rationales that Mr. Putin provided for his incursions into Ukraine was to protect Russian speakers there. Well, Russian speakers inside of Ukraine are precisely the ones who are bearing the brunt of the fighting. Their economy has collapsed. Their lives are disordered. Many of them are displaced. Their homes may have been destroyed. They're suffering. And the best way for them to stop suffering is if the Minsk agreement is fully implemented.Christi\u2014oh, immigration. With respect to immigration, obviously, I'm frustrated by a district court ruling that now is wending its way through the appeals process. We are being as aggressive as we can legally to, first and foremost, appeal that ruling, and then to implement those elements of immigration executive actions that were not challenged in court.But obviously, the centerpiece, one of the key provisions for me was being able to get folks who are undocumented to go through a background check\u2014criminal background check\u2014pay back taxes, and then have a legal status. And that requires an entire administrative apparatus and us getting them to apply and come clean.I made a decision, which I think is the right one, that we should not accept applications until the legal status of this is clarified. I am absolutely convinced this is well within my legal authority, Department of Homeland Security's legal authority. If you look at the precedent, if you look at the traditional discretion that the executive branch possesses when it comes to applying immigration laws, I am convinced that what we're doing is lawful, and our lawyers are convinced that what we're doing is lawful.But the United States is a government of laws and separations of power, and when a\u2014even if it's a individual district court judge who's making this determination, we've got to go through the process to challenge it. And until we get clarity there, I don't want to bring people in, have them apply and jump through a lot of hoops, only to have it deferred and delayed further.Of course, there's one really great way to solve this problem, and that would be Congress going ahead and acting, which would obviate the need for executive actions. The majority of the American people, I think, still want to see that happen. I suspect it will be a major topic of the next Presidential campaign.And so we will continue to push as hard as we can on all fronts to fix a broken immigration system. Administratively, we'll be prepared if and when we get the kind of ruling that I think we should have gotten in the first place about our authorities to go ahead and implement. But ultimately, this has never fully replaced the need for Congress to act. And my hope is, is that after a number of the other issues that we're working on currently get cleared, that there\u2014some quiet conversations start up\u2014back up again, particularly in the Republican Party, about the shortsighted approach that they're taking when it comes to immigration.Okay.

Thank you, Mr. President. The President. Thank you.Hong Kong/China  Q. I would like to ask your opinion about what recently happened in Hong Kong, the recent attack on press freedom in Hong Kong. And Jimmy Lai was arrested; his newsroom was raided. What\u2014how will the U.S. respond to this?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I think it's a terrible thing. But one thing that we have done\u2014you know, we gave tremendous incentives to Hong Kong because of freedom. We want freedom. And we were giving tremendous economic incentives to Hong Kong. And we have now withdrawn all of those incentives, and it will be impossible for Hong Kong to compete with the United States with respect to that. It just won't be, because we've taken all of the incentives away.If you look at China\u2014with the World Trade Organization, as an example\u2014they're getting tremendous, because they're considered a developing nation, which is ridiculous. Why should they be a developing nation, but we're not? And they get tremendous incentives.We have\u2014by the way, I told them it's unacceptable, and we've been doing that for a long time. They understand exactly how we feel, and big changes are being made. But with respect to Hong Kong, they get tremendous financial incentives so that they could do business and compete in the world.We've now withdrawn all of those incentives. It's going to be very hard for Hong Kong to compete. And I will tell you that the United States\u2014and I say this from any standpoint you want to hear it\u2014will end up making a lot more money because of it. Because we lost a lot of business to Hong Kong. We made it very convenient for people to go there, for companies to go there. We've withdrawn all of that. And the United States will be a big beneficiary from an economic standpoint, but I hate to see what happened to Hong Kong, because freedom is a great thing.Thank you all very much. Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. President. Do you believe that Turkey is doing enough to strengthen its northwest border with Syria? How is it that a NATO country with as large a military as Turkey has has not sealed this border? And is that something that you raised today with President Erdogan?And then, to put a finer point on the climate change question, can leaders gathered here believe that the United States will keep its commitments, even after you've left office, if a Republican succeeds you in the White House?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nJust with respect to my successor, let me, first of all, say that I'm anticipating a Democrat succeeding me. [] I'm confident in the wisdom of the American people on that front.But even if somebody from a different party succeeded me, one of the things that you find is when you're in this job, you think about it differently than when you're just running for the job. And what you realize is what I mentioned earlier, that American leadership involves not just playing to a narrow constituency back home, but you now are, in fact, at the center of what happens around the world and that your credibility and America's ability to influence events depends on taking seriously what other countries care about.Now, the fact of the matter is, there's a reason why you have the largest gathering of world leaders probably in human history here in Paris. Everybody else is taking climate change really seriously. They think it's a really big problem. It spans political parties. I mean, you travel around Europe, and you talk to leaders of governments and the opposition, and they are arguing about a whole bunch of things; one thing they're not arguing about is whether the science of climate change is real and whether or not we have to do something about it.So whoever is the President\u2014next President of the United States, if they come in and they suggest somehow that that global consensus\u2014not just 99.5 percent of scientists and experts, but 99 percent of world leaders\u2014think this is really important, I think the President of the United States is going to need to think this is really important. And that's why it's important for us to not project what's being said on a campaign trail, but to do what's right and make the case.And I would note that the American people, I think in the most recent survey, two-thirds of them said America should be a signatory to any agreement that emerges that is actually addressing climate change in a serious way. So the good news is, the politics inside the United States is changing as well. Sometimes, it may be hard for Republicans to support something that I'm doing, but that's more a matter of the games Washington plays. And that's why I think people should be confident that we'll meet our commitments on this.With respect to Turkey, I have had repeated conversations with President Erdogan about the need to close the border between Turkey and Syria. We've seen some serious progress on that front, but there are still some gaps. In particular, there's about 98 kilometers that are still used as a transit point for foreign fighters, ISIL shipping out fuel for sale that helps finance their terrorist activities.And so we have been having our militaries work together to determine how a combination of air and Turkish ground forces on the Turkish side of the border can do a much better job of sealing the border than currently is. And I think President Erdogan recognizes that. I'm also encouraged by the fact that President Erdogan and the EU had a series of meetings around\u2014or Turkey and the EU had a series of meetings around the issue of the Turkish-Greek border. We have to remind ourselves, Turkey has taken on an enormous humanitarian effort. There are millions of Syrians who are displaced and living inside of Turkey. Not just refugee camps, but they are now moving into major cities throughout Turkey. That puts enormous strains on their infrastructure, on their housing, on employment. And Turkey has continued to keep those borders open for people in real need.So I'm proud that the United States is the single largest contributor of humanitarian aid for Syrian refugees. I'm glad that the EU is looking to do more to help Turkey manage those refugee flows. But I also think the EU rightly wants to see the kind of orderly process along the Turkish-Greek border that's necessary for Europe to be able to regulate the amount of refugees it's absorbing and to save the lives of refugees who are oftentimes taking enormous risks because they're being ferried back and forth by human traffickers who are now operating in the same ways that you see drug traffickers operating under: at enormous profit and without regard for human life.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nTrust in the United States keeping its climate change commitments after the current president leaves office, particularly if a Republican succeeds him in the White House.\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Mr. President, yesterday you discussed Usama bin Laden's plans to turn Iraq into a terrorist sanctuary. What do you think your own reaction would have been 5 years ago had you been told that towards the end of your term, he would still be at large with that kind of capability, from Iraq, no less, and why\u2014can you tell the American people\u2014is he still on the run? Why is he so hard to catch?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI would say that 5 years ago\u2014like I said, we're going to pursue him. And we are pursuing him. And he's hiding. He is in a remote region of the world. If I knew precisely where he is, we would take the appropriate action to bring him to justice. He is attempting to establish a base of operations in Iraq. He hasn't established a base in operations. My points yesterday were, here was his intentions, but thankfully, of the three people I named, all of them no longer are a part of his operation.My point is, is that\u2014I was making the point, Jim, as I'm sure you recognized, that if we leave, they follow us. And my point was, was that Usama bin Laden was establishing an external cell there, or trying to. And he's been unable to do it, precisely my point. That's why we've got to stay engaged. Had he been able to establish an internal cell that had safe haven, we would be a lot more in danger today than we are. His organization is a risk. We will continue to pursue as hard as we possibly can. We will do everything we can to bring him and others to justice.We have had good success in the chief operating officer position of Al Qaida. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Ramzi al Rabium\u2014there's a lot of names that I\u2014 some of whom I mentioned yesterday, that are no longer a threat to the United States. We will continue to work to bring him to justice; that's exactly what the American people expect us to do, and, in the meantime, use the tools we put in place to protect this homeland.We are under threat. Now, some may say, well, he's just saying that to get people to pay attention to him, or try to scare them into\u2014for some reason. I would hope our world hadn't become so cynical that they don't take the threats of Al Qaida seriously, because they're real. And it's a danger to the American people. It's a danger to your children, Jim. And it's really important that we do all we can do to bring them to justice.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhy is he so hard to catch?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

As you well know, treating the root causes in Latin America doesn't change things overnight. How do you realistically and physically keep these families from coming to the U.S. when things will not get better in their countries right away?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I can't guarantee that. But I know, you know, that old thing: The journey of 1,000 miles starts with the first step.You know as well as I do; you cover it: You have serious\u2014it's not like somebody at a sitting hand-hewn table in Guatemala\u2014I mean, in somewhere in Mexico or in Guadalupe, saying: I've got a great idea. Let's sell everything we have. Give it to a coyote. Have him take our kids across the border and into a desert where they don't speak the language. Won't that be fun? Let's go. That's not how it happens. People don't want to leave.When my great-grandfather got on a coffin ship in the Irish Sea, expectation was: Was he going to live long enough on that ship to get to the United States of America? But they left because of what the Brits had been doing. They were in real, real trouble. They didn't want to leave. But they had no choice. So you've got\u2014we can't\u2014I can't guarantee we're going to solve everything, but I can guarantee we can make everything better. We can make it better. We can change the lives of so many people.And the other thing I want to point out to you and I hope you point out: I realize it's much more heart wrenching\u2014and it is\u2014to deal with a 5- and 6- and 7-year-old. But you went down there, and you saw: The vast majority of these children\u201470 percent\u2014are 16 years old, 17 years old, and mostly males. Doesn't make it\u2014that doesn't make it good, bad, or indifferent. But the idea that we have tens of thousands of kids in these God-awful facilities that are, really, little babies crying all night\u2014and there's some; that's true. That's why we've got to act.And yesterday I asked my team\u2014both the Director of the two agencies, as well as others\u2014I asked them what would they, in fact\u2014and I asked their opinion because they're the experts\u2014but I said, Focus on the most vulnerable immediately.But there's no reason why, in the next month, as people cross the border, that phone call can't be made in the first 48 hours and begin.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow do you realistically and physically keep these families from coming to the U.S. when things will not get better in their countries right away?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

A question going out to His Excellency, President Bush. With regards to removing North Korea from the terrorism list, we understand that beginning on the 12th, North Korea might be able to be removed from the list. When do you expect, Mr. Bush, President Bush, that North Korea may be removed from the list? Are there any preconditions or is there anything that North Korea must do for them to be removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes. The 12th is the first opportunity where they may be lifted off the list. And, yes, they got a lot to do. They got to, like, show us a verification regime that we can trust. This is a stepby-step process.I don't know whether or not they're going to give up their weapons. I really don't know. I don't think either of us knows. I know this, that the six-party talks is the best way to convince them to give up their weapons. I know there's a framework in place that will make it easier for those of us who care about this issue to work together to send a common message to the leader: You have a choice to make: You can verifiably do what you say you're going to do, or you'll continue to be the most sanctioned regime in the world.We have put out a step-by-step process to\u2014as a way forward for the n leader. This isn't a U.S. proposal; this is a five-party proposal. South Korea has been a very integral part of the process, and they will remain an integral part of the process. We're all at the table together, saying the same thing.And so part of the step-by-step was to say, okay, if you do the following things like you said you would do, you get off the terrorist list. That could conceivably happen, as you mentioned, on the 12th. However, it's going to require action on the leader of 's part. It just doesn't automatically happen.We changed the way it used to be. It used to be that\u2014okay, we'll give you something and hope that you end up responding. It's no longer that way. The six-party talks basically says, you have made a promise; once you fulfill your promise, then something will happen positively. And so I\u2014 we'll see. It's his choice to make as to whether or not he gets to come off the list. If he is off the list, I want to remind you that he'll still be\u2014they will still be the most sanctioned country in the world.And so then the fundamental question is, do they want to continue on and try to change the status? Do they want to try to change their isolation? Do they want to enter the community of nations? Do they want to be viewed as a peaceful country? And so there's a series of steps that we've all agreed to, including , that it's up to them to make the decision as to how they'll proceed.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nExpected timing of North Korea's removal from the terrorism list\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. One of your chief allies in the war on terrorism, President Musharraf of Pakistan, has faced so much instability and civil strife recently that there has been talk of declaring a state of emergency. How concerned are you about President Musharraf's situation and whether this might undermine Pakistani efforts against the Taliban and Al Qaida elements in the bordering areas of his country, which have been roundly criticized recently?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYou know, I've seen the reports of what they call an emergency declaration. I have seen no such evidence that he's made that decision. In my discussions with President Musharraf, I have reminded him that we share a common enemy, extremists and radicals who would like to do harm to our respective societies. In his case, they would like to kill him, and they've tried.I have made it clear to him that I would expect there to be full cooperation in sharing intelligence, and I believe we've got good intelligence sharing. I have indicated to him that the American people would expect there to be swift action taken if there is actionable intelligence on high-value targets inside his country. Now, I recognize Pakistan is a sovereign nation, and that's important for Americans to recognize that. But it's also important for Americans to understand that he shares the same concern about radicals and extremists as I do and as the American people do.So my focus in terms of the domestic scene there is that he have a free and fair election. And that's what we have been talking to him about, and I'm hopeful they will.Yes, we'll just go down the line here.

And it's important, I think, for the American people to understand that and not to live in fear. It's just a reality of today's world that there are going to be threats out there.We have, I think, greatly improved our homeland security since 9/11 occurred. I am constantly impressed with the dedication that our teams apply to this problem. They are chasing down every thread, not just from Al Qaida, but any other actor out there that might be engaging in terrorism. They are making sure that even a--what might appear to be a lone individual who has very little organizational capacity--if they make a threat, they follow up.But one of the things that I want to make sure we do as long as I'm President and beyond my Presidency is to understand America's strength in part comes from its resilience, and that we don't start losing who we are or overreacting if, in fact, there is the threat of terrorism out there.We go about our business. We are tougher than them. Our families and our businesses and our churches and mosques and synagogues and our Constitution, our values, that's what gives us strength. And we are going to have this problem out there for a long time to come. But it doesn't have to completely distort us. And it doesn't have to dominate our foreign policy. What we can do is to constantly fight against it. And I think ultimately we are going to be able to stamp it out. But it's going to take some time.White House Press Secretary Robert L. Gibbs.

Well, I appreciate that, sir. Thank you very much. Mr. President, Vladimir Putin\u2014\u2014[At this point, a microphone was brought to Mr. Lemire.] Q. \u2014\u2014thank you. Vladimir Putin, who you'll be seeing in a few days in Geneva, said just a couple of days ago that he believed that U.S.-Russia relations were at a low point. In what concrete ways could your summit change that?And then, secondly, on the same topic: You have said previously, and in the runup to the summit, that you would be unafraid to call out Russia's disruptive actions\u2014like cyber hacks, Ukraine, election interference\u2014but you're not having a joint press conference with Putin. Why not take the chance to stand side by side with him and say those things to him with the world watching?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\n[] Well, let me make it clear: I think he's right it's a low point, and it depends on how he responds to acting consistent with international norms, which, in many cases, he has not.As I told him when I was running and when I got elected, before it was\u2014I was sworn in, that I was going to find out whether or not he, in fact, did engage in trying to interfere in our election; that I was going to take a look at whether he was involved in the\u2014a cybersecurity breach that occurred, et cetera; and if I did, I was going to respond.I did; I checked it out. So I had access to all the intelligence. He was engaged in those activities. I did respond and made it clear that I'd respond again.With regard to\u2014I always found\u2014and I don't mean to suggest that the press should not know\u2014but this is not a contest about who can do better in front of a press conference or try to embarrass each other. It's about making myself very clear what the conditions are to get a better relationship are\u2014with Russia.We're not looking for conflict. We are looking to resolve those actions which we think are inconsistent with international norms, number one. Number two, where we can work together, we may be able to do that in terms of some strategic doctrine that may be able to be worked together. We're ready to do it. And there may be other areas. There's even talk there may be the ability to work together on climate.So the bottom line is that I think the best way to deal with this is for he and I to meet, he and I to have our discussion. I know you don't doubt that I'll be very straightforward\u2014[]\u2014with him about our concerns. And I will make clear my view of how that meeting turned out, and he'll make clear how\u2014from his perspective, how it turned out.But I don't want to get into being diverted by: Did they shake hands? How far did they\u2014who talked the most, and the rest. Now, he can say what he said the meeting was about, and I will say what I think the meeting was about.That's how I'm going to handle it.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nIn what concrete ways could your summit with Vladimir Putin change the currently low U.S.-Russia relations?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Are you perhaps facing an ultimatum on the war this fall with Congress?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYou know, I\u2014first of all, I appreciate the Members coming down to the White House. We had a good exchange. It gave me a chance to share with them my feelings about the Iraqi issue. I spent time talking to them about what it meant to fail and what it means when we succeed. They expressed their opinions. They're obviously concerned about the Iraq war, but so are a lot of other people.I remind people\u2014I reminded them that last fall, late fall, I had been one of these people that get endlessly polled. You know, these surveys and the pollsters constantly calling people all the time, it looks like\u2014 and had asked my opinion; I'd have said, I disapprove of what was going on in Iraq. You could have put me down as part of the disapproval process\u2014and, therefore, had put a plan in place that would more likely cause me to approve of what's going on in Iraq. That's why I made the decision I made.I explained to them why I made the decision I made. And I said, look, David Petraeus has got a plan, and Members of Congress\u2014some Members of Congress won't let him implement the plan. That doesn't make any sense, on the one hand, for us to send him out with the unanimous confirmation by the Senate, and then to deny him the troops and/or the funds necessary to get the job done. And I reminded them that we ought to give David Petraeus a chance.I did explain to them that General Petraeus has said he's going to come back and report to the Secretary and the Joint Chiefs and the White House and the Congress about whether or not the strategy that he thinks could work is working. And at that point in time, we will respond accordingly.As I have told people, that decisions about the posture in Iraq need to be based upon conditions on the ground. And no better person to report about the conditions on the ground than somebody who was there, and that would be General Petraeus. And at that point in time, upon the recommendation of the Secretary and the Joint Chiefs and General Petraeus, we will respond to what he says. And so I said, why don't we wait and see what happens? Let's give this plan a chance to work. Let's stop playing politics. It's one thing to have a good, honest debate about the way forward in Iraq, it's another thing to put our troops right in the middle of that debate.These troops deserve the money necessary to do the job. And our commanders need the flexibility necessary to do the job. And I believe this cause is necessary and it's noble. That's why I put those young men and women out there in the first place. It's necessary for the peace and security of our country. It's noble to have such amazing citizens volunteer to go into harm's way. And our Congress needs to support them. It's one thing to have a political debate or a debate about strategies, it's another thing to make sure that money gets sent to them on a timely basis. I repeat: This idea of funding our troops every 2 months is not adequate, and I frankly don't think it's right. They need to give the\u2014 these troops what they\u2014what the military has asked for them.And we can debate Iraq and should. But there should be no debate about making sure that money gets there on a timely basis so our kids can do the job we've asked them to do.I want to thank you all for your time.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nUltimatum on the war this fall with Congress?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

But in terms of criticism that you're, sort of, supporting a dictator instead of an American Vice President?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, when I look at what's been done by our Vice President and the President, when I look at the horrible Iran deal that they made, look what happened since I terminated the Iran deal. Look what has happened to Iran.Iran, when I first came into office, was a terror. They were fighting in many locations all over the Middle East. They were behind every single major attack, whether it was Syria, whether it was Yemen, whether it was individual, smaller areas, whether it was taking away oil from people. They were involved with everything.Now they're pulling back, because they're got serious economic problems. We have massive\u2014as you know, massive sanctions and other things. I mean, we just said the other day: steel, copper, different elements of what they used to sell. The oil is essentially dried up. And I'm not looking that\u2014to hurt Iran at all. I'm looking to have Iran say, No nuclear weapons. We have enough problems in this world right now with nuclear weapons. No nuclear weapons for Iran.And I think we'll make a deal. I think Iran\u2014again, I think Iran has tremendous economic potential. And I look forward to letting them get back to the stage where they can show that. I think Iran\u2014I know so many people from Iran. These are great people. It has a chance to be a great country, with the same leadership. We're not looking for regime change. I just want to make that clear. We're looking for no nuclear weapons.If you look at the deal that Biden and President Obama signed, they would have access\u2014free access\u2014to nuclear weapons, where they wouldn't even be in violation, in just a very short period of time. What kind of a deal is that?So we can't have that. Plus, there were many other things they did that were very bad. So I don't take sides as to who I'm in favor or who I'm not, but I can tell you that Joe Biden was a disaster. His administration, with President Obama, they were basically a disaster when it came to so many things, whether it was economy, whether it was military, defense. No matter what it was, they had a lot problems. So I'm not a fan.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nBut in terms of criticism that you're, sort of, supporting a dictator instead of an American Vice President?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

We all appreciate it. It's always good to have a chance to ask questions of you directly. Can you tell us a little more about how this China deal may work going forward? Because Chinese officials have told Fox News that they will not make any concessions until all of the tariffs have been lifted. They also want relief on Huawei. They want it taken off the blacklist. They might want you to stop pursuing extradition of Meng Wanzhou. Can you tell us how you see all of this unfolding?And if you do meet Kim Jong Un at the DMZ tomorrow, would you step across the border into North Korea?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nSure I would. I would. I'd feel very comfortable doing that. I would have no problem.With respect to China basically we agreed today that we were going to continue the negotiation\u2014which I ended a while back\u2014and we're going to continue the negotiation. We agreed that I would not be putting tariffs on the $325 billion that I would have the ability to put on if I wanted; that\u2014where you know we're fairly advanced depending on where you want to look at and where you want to start. Pretty advanced.We discussed\u2014we did discuss numerous other things. We mentioned Huawei. I said: We'll have to save that until the very end. We'll have to see.One of the things I will allow however is\u2014a lot of people are surprised\u2014we send and we sell to Huawei a tremendous amount of product that goes into the various things that they make. And I said that that's okay that we will keep selling that product. These are American companies John that make product. And that's very complex by the way. Highly scientific.And in some cases we're the ones that do it and we're the only ones that do it. We're the only ones with the technology. What we've done in Silicon Valley is incredible actually. And nobody has been able to compete with it. And I've agreed\u2014and pretty easily\u2014I've agreed to allow them to continue to sell that product so American companies will continue. And they were having a problem. The companies were not exactly happy that they couldn't sell because they had nothing to do with whatever was potentially happening with respect to Huawei. So I did do that. We talked about education and students. Somebody was saying it was harder for a Chinese students to come in. And that's something that if it were\u2014if somebody viewed it that way I don't. We want to have Chinese students come and use our great schools our great universities. They've been great students and tremendous assets. But we did discuss it. It was brought up as a point and I said that will be just like anybody else just like any other nation.And we're actually going to a point where you know we're looking that if you graduate from a college because our great companies\u2014we talk about Silicon Valley and other places\u2014we have a problem in this\u2014in our country that you graduate number one in your class from the best school in the country and you\u2014they say you have to leave; we can't keep them. And we're going to make it\u2014we're going to call it the smart person's waiver. But we're going to make it so that they can not only stay but maybe they have access to green cards. We want to keep these people here. We have to keep\u2014yes go ahead John.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nIf you do meet Kim Jong Un at the DMZ tomorrow, would you step across the border into North Korea?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

And the answer, in my judgment, was, no, we would never be able to configure our troops that way, in that configuration\u2014place our troops in that configuration given the violence inside the capital city.David Petraeus felt like that it was important to tell the White House and tell the Congress that he would come back with an assessment in September.

And the people aren't going to stand for it; they want to get back.They're not going to stand for it. They want our country opened. I want our country opened too. I want it opened safely, but I want it open.Don't forget, people are dying the other route. You can go with the enclosed route: Everything is closed up, you're in your house, you're not allowed to move. People are dying with that too. You look at drug addiction, you look at suicides, you look at some of the things that are taking place, people are dying that way too. You could make the case, it's in even greater numbers.So it's a situation that some people\u2014and I've noticed that some States could be moving more quickly. And also, at the same time, safety. Look, safety is paramount. But people are dying in the lockdown position too. And everybody understands that. They're just starting to find out. And look at what's going on with drugs, and look at what's happening with suicides.Yes, please.

I get another one. [Laughter] This is a good deal. Can you tell us whether you think your personal relationship with the Democratic leaders in Congress has had a negative impact on your ability to get your legislation through? And how important is that personal relationship?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI have got cordial relations with the leaders when I talk to them. I saw Speaker Pelosi last night at the Congressional Ball at the White House, and we have very cordial relations. Here's\u2014 Congress\u2014the Democrats in Congress, in the House and the Senate, need to work out their differences before they come to the White House. You can imagine what it's like to try to deal on an important piece of legislation, and the Democrats in the House have one opinion, and the Democrats in the Senate have another opinion. FISA is a good example.And in order for us to be able to reach accord, they've got to come with one voice, one position. And it's\u2014nobody\u2014like, the most disappointing thing about Washington has been the name-calling and this kind of\u2014people go out in front of the mikes, and they just kind of unleash. And I've tried hard not to do that. I've tried to be respectful to all parties. And that's disappointing.On the other hand, I think we can get some things done. The Peruvian trade vote is one; there's an example. And the Congress needs to get their differences sorted. One of the worst ways to negotiate is to negotiate with one group. They pocket your negotiations, and then another group shows up and says, Well, you've said this to them, now give us this.And hopefully, as we come down the stretch here, that they're capable of coming forward with, Here's what we believe; here's our plan; here's what we would like you to consider, as opposed to some examples, which is passing legislation for the sake of the headline, as opposed to passing legislation to get it passed. And SCHIP is a classic example. They knew I was going to veto the bill. They knew that was going to happen. They knew the veto would be sustained. But they ate up valuable time and passed the bill anyway.And so we sit here in the White House trying to figure out why. Why would you waste time? Why wouldn't you sit down and try to seriously negotiate an agreement on a bill that they knew was going to get vetoed and sustained?Now, hopefully, in the next\u2014however long they intend to stay here, that we're capable of working together. But if not, I'm going to stand strong for certain principles, and one of which is to make sure our troops get funded. We've got men and women in combat. We've got people risking their lives for the United States of America. And this Congress has yet to fund them, and it needs to. And it needs to fund them without telling our military how to conduct this war. Arbitrary dates for withdrawal are unacceptable, particularly given the fact that the strategy is working\u2014it's working.And it seems like to me that this Congress ought to be congratulating our military commanders and our troops. And one way to send a congratulatory message is to give them the funds they need, and now is the time to do it.Let's see here, Mark Silva [Chicago Tribune].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow important is that personal relationship?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. My question is on Iraq. Mr. President, this morning you talked at length about Afghanistan, Iran, but not Iraq. And I wanted to ask both of you, is France reconciled with the United States as the United States is reconciled with France? So what about Iraq? Can France, for instance, help to get out of the Iraqi quagmire? And President Bush, where do you stand on Iraq and your domestic debate on Iraq? Do you have a timetable for withdrawing troops?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes. I don't\u2014you know, quagmire is an interesting word. If you lived in Iraq and had lived under a tyranny, you'd be saying, God, I love freedom. Because that's what's happened. And there are killers and radicals and murderers who kill the innocent to stop the advance of freedom. But freedom is happening in Iraq, and we're making progress.And I can't thank the President enough for sending his Foreign Minister to Baghdad. It was a clear message that freedom matters, that when people are struggling to live in freedom, that those of us who have the comfort of a free society ought to help them.We had a difference of opinion with your great country over whether or not I should have used military force to enforce U.N. demands. I reminded a TV reporter\u2014I don't know if the person is here or not\u2014 but I said, I just want to remind you that 1441 was supported by France and the United States, which clearly said to the dictator, you will disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences. Now, I'm the kind of person that when somebody says something, I take them for their word.Having said that, we had a difference of opinion. But I don't sense any difference of opinion now that a struggling democracy wants help from those of us who live in the comfort of free societies. And, Mr. President, the strong gesture of sending your Foreign Minister there wasn't a message to the United States, because we're good friends; it was message to the Iraqi citizens that said: We hear your cries for freedom; we want you to succeed, because one of the lessons of history is, free societies yield peace.And so I appreciate your leadership on that issue, and I want to thank your Foreign Minister for\u2014I don't see your Foreign Minister. Look, the guy was here. [] Oh, there he is, yes, next to\u2014look, the President was blocking\u2014next to Madam Rice. Anyway, thank you, sir. Allow me to give you two answers in one. On , yes, we're worried about the situation. It's worrisome, and we need to have elections as swiftly as possible. You cannot combat extremism using the same methods as extremists, and it is very important, it is of the essence that organize elections. I, like President Bush, I wish this to take place as speedily as possible.Let me remind you that this is a country of 150 million inhabitants who happens to have nuclear weapons. This is very important for us that one day we shouldn't wake up with a government, an administration in which is in the hands of the extremists. And we should, each and every one of us, think about this, of the principles, the values that we uphold and that we defend and we must continue to uphold. And then there's the complexity, as it were, in the field. That's why it's important to convene election, call elections.Now, on Iraq, Bernard Kouchner's trip to Iraq was very successful. What does France want? A united Iraq. No one\u2014no, it is in no one's interest to see Iraq dismantled. We want a democratic Iraq. We want a diverse Iraq, where each component element of Iraqi society has learned to live with others; an Iraq which is\u2014which can administer and govern itself and that has the means of ensuring the peace and security of every one of its citizens. And that is exactly Bernard Kouchner's message when he went to Iraq. And this is in the interest of one and all that it be thus, and that position is the position I will defend until the end.

[Inaudible][Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]Prime Minister Trudeau. Briefly, in French: In regard to Haiti, Canada has always been there to help the Haitian people, and we are working with our partners in the region to guarantee better solutions for the Haitian people. We have laid sanctions against the elites. We are helping the National Police in Haiti.We have had good exchanges, good dialogues with our partners in the U.S. and Caribbean countries to guarantee that we will be able to preserve and to have the people of Haiti at the center of the solutions.In regard to the economic integration and the competitiveness in North America, be it electric vehicles, be it Critical Minerals Strategy minerals, and the ones we're going to develop to produce the necessary technologies or in regard to any other technologies in order to work together, because we know that North America can offer many solutions, great competitiveness to the rest of the world, and we are a true force to reckon with in our continent.Moderator. Sara Pablo of the Formula Group will pose a question to the constitutional President of the United Mexican States. Q. Yes. Good afternoon, Presidents, Prime Minister. And we have a few questions for President Biden.I know that recently you announced the United States will be receiving citizens from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba, and Nicaragua. What is the timeframe? And are you thinking of expanding the number of people you will be receiving? And is this\u2014some other nations could be included? And what is the amount in technological improvements in the United States?And for President L\u00f3pez Obrador: How will Mexico be prepared to receive all the migrants the United States will be expelling from its territory? And the new migration center in the southern part of Mexico, what is it all about?And then, after this 10th summit, are we going to be seeing changes in migration policies in the way migrants are being treated?And finally, let me\u2014this is for President Biden: fentanyl. What concrete actions are you going to be implementing? What's the impact of the detention of Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n? Because the Cartel of the Pacific is one of the main fentanyl producers.And finally, another question on energy sector consultations. President Biden, Prime Minister Trudeau, did you discuss those discussions about the USMCA, the T-MEC?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nVery well. We did speak about migration in a very broad manner. Of course, there is cooperation with the U.S. administration. And at the same time, we have a commitment to protect migrants.What President Biden has proposed is absolutely true. If migrants cross our country\u2014and, in some cases, they also go through other countries in Latin America\u2014to arrive in the United States, migrants are facing so many risks when they do that, starting with the fact that they are victims of the trafficants\u2014the smugglers\u2014the human traffickers known as the or . And they charge migrants a high amount of money to take them northbound.Now, those or have networks. And at the same time, they hire trailers, trucks\u2014truck trailers. The box of the trailer, they can transport up to 300, 400 people. So the\u2014constant accidents are taking place on the highways of Mexico, the roads of Mexico, unfortunately.And the worst of it all is that many migrants are being kidnapped by criminal groups, by criminals. They're being murdered. And this is very sad, very painful.That's why I'm speaking about protection. We\u2014what we want is an in-depth solution. We've always said that people\u2014just as President Biden said, people do not leave their towns, their countries, their families because they like to do it. This is not a pleasure for them. They do it because of the needs they have. This is a necessity.We've always said we have to look at the root causes of all this. We have to try for people to be able to work and be happy where they were born, where their relatives, their customs, their traditions, their cultures are. And we need to invest for that. We need to invest in development of the countries with more inequality and poverty, because migration has to be an optional thing, not a forced situation.However, in the meantime\u2014because we're, of course, doing everything we can to accomplish this\u2014Mexico, with just a few resources, is helping. I have already mentioned that we are working\u2014we are working with communities in El Salvador, in Honduras. We're going to be starting this in Guatemala and Belize as well.However, we do need to promote development even more\u2014and well-being\u2014to ensure, guarantee opportunities for those that are forced to migrate and leave their communities.We are not thinking of building any center in the southeastern part of Mexico\u2014any migration center. We're not thinking of that. What we do is help with shelters, with health care services, with food services as well. That's the way we help migrants.And we do celebrate the fact that the U.S. administration has taken\u2014made the decision, rather, to have an orderly migration flow in the case, for instance, of our Venezuelan brothers and sisters. And I understand that this plan will also be extended\u2014will be expanded to benefit other migrants, other countries.We know for sure that since the announcement was made saying that those permits, humanitarian visas were going to be granted in the case, for instance, of the Venezuelan population, we've seen a decrease in migration flows, or people crossing Mexico to migrate.This has been a considerable reduction because this was announced in the United States, and this was made public everywhere, saying that 24,000 humanitarian visas or permits were going to be granted and that the formalities had to be covered, the paperwork. Although there are some requirements that have to be met, people decided to do it. So what happened was that a new path has been opened; it didn't exist before.Everything was arriving in the United States, risking everything\u2014risking people's lives, of course, at the risk of their own lives. Now that this mechanism has been approved, people can file their own request. And this might take time. However, there's hope. A hope that this is\u2014a purpose is going to be accomplished: the purpose of going to the United States to work, to live.We celebrate this, and we think that\u2014I insist what Canada is doing is also the right thing to do.And I was talking about our own experience as well. And you can look at data. It's there for you to look at. Because of circumstances in the past, migration corresponded to the sister countries of Central America that were\u2014those were the main migration flows from Central America\u2014but, for a long time as well, Mexicans migrating who were going to look for a better living standard, who were going to look for a job in the United States.And just imagine: There are 40 million Mexicans in the United States\u201440 million who were born here in Mexico, or they're the children of people who were born in Mexico.Now, what have we been able to accomplish with all the support for well-being? We've reduced the number of Mexican migrants, yes. There are less migrants abandoning Mexico now because there's public investment; because out of 35 million families, 30 million families of Mexican families are now receiving at least a program\u2014a well-being program. And this is a very direct manner of doing this here in Mexico.All the senior citizens, 65 or over, receive a pension. This is a universal program in Mexico. Eleven million of senior citizens in Mexico are getting a pension. Eleven million students of low-income families, of poor families are getting grants. They're getting scholarships. All the boys and girls with disabilities also have their own pension.We have a program for reforestation. It is the most important reforestation program in the world. And we are planting over 1 million hectares of fruit and timber trees. And we are giving jobs to over 400,000 peasants that are growing, planting those trees.So, then, all these programs help so that people may be staying in their own communities, in their towns.We built the Dos Bocas refinery\u201435,000 jobs. We are now building the Mayan train, which is the biggest railroad works in the world because it's 1,554 kilometers\u20141,554 kilometers\u2014in five States of Mexico.All the Maya region\u2014which is one of the most important archaeological zones of the world\u2014well, there, people are working, building this railroad system. About 300,000 people are building the train. So that's really the option. That's the path to follow: development, well-being.And I insist, I repeat: I truly celebrate that the Canadian Government and the U.S. administration, as well, are now attending to the migration problem with this type of approach. It's quite lamentable that there are others\u2014other politicians, other Presidents and public officials who are acting in a very inhuman manner.Right now, in this winter season, for instance, with all due respect\u2014I'm not saying this in a very direct manner, but what I'm saying is that, I mean, one of the Governors of our neighboring country headed a movement to take migrants to New York, to Washington, and just drop them there. This is politicking. This is completely inhuman. This should not be done. Because there are those who forget that we are all migrants.How is it that that great nation, the United States, was developed? With migrants. Thanks to that, so then we have to continue seeking, looking for alternatives. Just as, for instance, also in the case of violence, we have to look into the root causes of violence.And also in the case of our country, youth were never cared for. No services for young people. And the only thing that was done was call them young people who didn't work, who didn't study. This is a discriminatory labeling for youth. They don't study; they don't work. they were called in Mexico. They don't do one thing. They don't do the other thing either.So no one was ever caring for our youth in Mexico. All those young people only had\u2014the only option they had, I mean, was to migrate. And many migrated, acting in a respectful manner, a very responsible fashion. And others as well were trying to make a living because they didn't have any other opportunities. So they made a living in what we call the informal economy, which is, you know, making a living out in the street, no matter what. I mean, whichever way you can make a living without falling into illicit activities. However, unfortunately, many did go into the path of antisocial behaviors.But we didn't really take care of young people in Mexico. However, we now have a program devoted to young people. This program never existed in the past. There are 2.4 million young people who are being hired. They are working, and they're apprentices.What are we doing? We are taking away from them this culture, those seats, the reserves, the stock. We're taking that away from criminal groups. We're taking youth\u2014we don't want our youth to be hooked. We don't want those criminal groups to be taking our youth away. We want to give them opportunities. That's exactly what we're doing in Mexico.And let me conclude also highlighting another difference which is quite important: There is no corruption in the administration, the Government that I represent. There's no impunity either.There's\u2014we have painted this line that is very clear. Crime is one thing, and the authority is a different thing. There is no criminal association or partnership as before.Yes, this is\u2014we're even ashamed to mention this, that\u2014to mention that those who were in charge of guaranteeing or ensuring public security were at the service\u2014in the past\u2014were at the service of criminal organizations. This doesn't happen in Mexico anymore.That's why in this meeting, this summit we just held today, all three governments of the three countries, we have reached agreements to continue working together to get peace\u2014to have peace in all three countries so that we can ensure and guarantee security of our peoples.That's all I wanted to answer to your question, Madam.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDiscussions about energy sector consultations in relation to the USMCA and T-MEC.\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

We hear that you will be talking to President Putin anytime soon. What is your approach?And as the Ukrainian war seems to be at a turning point, do you feel realistic that President Zelenskyy is putting a condition to open negotiations and that is the return of Crimea to Ukraine?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nLook, there is one way for this war to end the rational way: Putin to pull out of Ukraine. Number one. But it appears he's not going to do that. He's paying a very heavy price for failing to do it, but he's inflicting incredible, incredible carnage on the civilian population of Ukraine, bombing nurseries, hospitals, children's homes. It's sick what he's doing.But the fact of the matter is, I have no immediate plans to contact Mr. Putin. Mr. Putin is\u2014let me choose my words very carefully\u2014I'm prepared to speak with Mr. Putin if in fact there is an interest in him deciding he's looking for a way to end the war. He hasn't done that yet. If that's the case, in consultation with my French and my NATO friends, I'll be happy to sit down with Putin to see what he wants\u2014has in mind. He hasn't done that yet.In the meantime, I think it's absolutely critical what Emmanuel said: We must support the Ukrainian people. The idea that Putin is ever going to defeat Ukraine is beyond comprehension. Imagine them trying to occupy that country through the next 2, 5, 10, 20 years if they could\u2014if they could.He's miscalculated every single thing he initially calculated. He thought he'd be greeted with open arms by the Russian-speaking portions of the Ukrainian population.Go back and read his speech when he invaded\u2014when I said they were going to invade, and they did when we said they were. Go back and read the speech he made. He talked about him\u2014with needing to be another Peter the Great. He talked about the need for the people\u2014that Kyiv is the motherload of Russian identity in the beginning, et cetera, et cetera. He's just miscalculated across the board.And so the question is, what is his decision\u2014how does he get himself out of the circumstance he's in? I'm prepared, if he's willing to talk, to find out what he's willing to do, but I'll only do it in consultation with my NATO allies. I'm not going to do it on my own.Thank you.[.] Regarding your question and the preconditions or the conditions set by the Ukrainian President, I believe that what is important for all of us to look at is that as Ukraine is resisting, suffering from war crimes, attacks on their civilian infrastructure, leading counteroffensive, President Zelenskyy presented a 10-point peace plan.So we, I believe, very much need to continue to engage with him, because there is a genuine willingness, on behalf of Ukraine, to discuss these matters. And we acknowledge it, and we commend it.And, for a number of years, I was in charge of monitoring the implementation of the Minsk Agreements. And the latest\u2014at the last meeting between President Zelenskyy and President Putin, the only one\u2014December 2019\u2014at the time, I was with Chancellor Merkel. And I can tell you that I saw a President who was sincere in his willingness to talk and to negotiate.And since he was elected, until May, President Zelenskyy was very much willing to talk and negotiate. The one who wanted to go to war, to wage war was President Putin. And I could see it by myself, including when I visited Russia and Ukraine at the beginning of February.So it's only legitimate that President Zelenskyy sets some conditions to talk. We need to work on what could lead to a peace agreement, but it is for him to tell us when the time comes and what the choices of the Ukrainians are.So once this has been said, indeed, I will continue to talk to President Putin. And as a matter of fact, we talked about it this morning with President Biden, because we constantly, as well, tried to prevent escalation and to get some very concrete results.So I will talk to him about security and safety of nuclear plants in the areas that are being claimed, including Zaporizhzhia, in particular. And over the past few months, we did some work on the Chernobyl nuclear plant, and there is some outstanding work ongoing, which is very important, by Mr. Grossi and his agency, the IAEA. So we will continue.Thank you so much. Thanks, folks.

Mr. President, just a quick follow on the same theme of consequences. You said, just now, that you spoke to him a lot about human rights. What did you say would happen if opposition leader Alexei Navalny dies?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI made it clear to him that I believe the consequences of that would be devastating for .I'll go back to the same point: What do you think happens when he's saying, It's not about hurting Navalny, this\u2014you know, all the stuff he says to rationalize the treatment of Navalny\u2014and then he dies in prison?I pointed out to him that it matters a great deal when a country, in fact\u2014and they asked me why I thought that it was important to continue to have problems with the President of Syria. I said: Because he's in violation of an international norm. It's called a Chemical Weapons Treaty. Can't be trusted. It's about trust. It's about their ability to influence other nations in a positive way.Look, would you like to trade our economy for 's economy? Would you like to trade? And by the way, we talked about trade. I don't have any problem with doing business with , as long as they do it based upon international norms. It's in our interest to see the n people do well economically. I don't have a problem with that.But if they do not act according to international norms, then guess what? That will not\u2014that only won't it happen with us, it will not happen with other nations. And he kind of talked about that\u2014didn't he, today?\u2014about how the need to reach out to other countries to invest in . They won't as long as they are convinced that, in fact, the violations\u2014for example, the American businessman who was in house arrest. And I had pointed out: You want to get American business to invest? Let him go. Change the dynamic. Because American businessmen, they're not ready to show up. They don't want to hang around in Moscow.I mean, I\u2014look, guys, I know we make foreign policy out to be this great, great skill that somehow is, sort of, like a secret code. Practical\u2014all foreign policy is, is a logical extension of personal relationships. It's the way human nature functions.And understand, when you run a country that does not abide by international norms, and yet you need those international norms to be somehow managed so that you can participate in the benefits that flow from them, it hurts you. That's not a satisfying answer: Biden said he'd invade . You know, it is not\u2014you know. By the way, that was a joke. [] That's not true. But my generic point is, it is\u2014it is more complicated than that.David Sanger [New York Times]. I thought I saw David.

The President. Thirty four? [Laughter] But what I've said is, is that I can maybe give some counsel and advice to the Democratic Party. And I think that the thing we have to spend the most time on\u2014because it's the thing we have the most control over\u2014is, how do we make sure that we are showing up in places where I think Democratic policies are needed, where they are helping, where they are making a difference, but where people feel as if they're not being heard and where Democrats are characterized as coastal, liberal, latte-sipping, politically correct, out-of-touch folks? We have to be in those communities. And I've seen that when we are in those communities, it makes a difference.That's how I became President. I became a U.S. Senator not just because I had a strong base in Chicago, but because I was driving around downstate Illinois and going to fish fries and sitting in VFW halls and talking to farmers. And I didn't win every one of their votes, but they got a sense of what I was talking about, what I cared about, that I was for working people, that I was for the middle class, that the reason I was interested in strengthening unions and raising the minimum wage and rebuilding our infrastructure and making sure that parents had decent childcare and family leave was because my own family's history wasn't that different from theirs, even if I looked a little bit different. Same thing in Iowa.And so the question is, how do we rebuild that party as a whole so that there's not a county in any State\u2014I don't care how red\u2014where we don't have a presence and we're not making the argument. Because I think we have the better argument. But that requires a lot of work. It's been something that I've been able to do successfully in my own campaigns. It is not something I've been able to transfer to candidates in midterms and sort of build a sustaining organization around. That's something that I would have liked to have done more of, but it's kind of hard to do when you're also dealing with a whole bunch of issues here in the White House.And that doesn't mean, though, that it can't be done. And I think there are going to be a lot of talented folks out there, a lot of progressives who share my values who are going to be leading the charge in the years to come.Michelle Kosinski of CNN.The President's Communications With President-Elect Donald J. Trump/Federal Bureau of Investigation  Q. Thank you. So this week we heard Hillary Clinton talk about how she thinks that the FBI Director's most recent announcement made a difference in the outcome of the election. And we also just heard in an op-ed her campaign chairman talk about something being deeply broken within the FBI. He talked about thinking that the investigation early on was lackadaisical in his words. So what do you think about those comments? Do you think there's any truth to them? Do you think there's a danger there that they're calling into question the integrity of institutions in a similar way that Donald Trump's team has done?And a second part to that is that Donald Trump's team repeatedly\u2014I guess, giving the indication that the investigation of the Russian hack, as well as the retaliation, might not be such a priority once he's in office, so what do you think the risk is there? And are you going to talk to him directly about some of those comments he made?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, on the latter point, as I said before, the transition from election season to governance season is not always smooth. It's bumpy. There are still feelings that are raw out there. There are people who are still thinking about how things unfolded. And I get all that. But when Donald Trump takes the oath of office and is sworn as the 45th President of the United States, then he's got a different set of responsibilities and considerations. And I've said this before: I think there is a sobering process when you walk into the Oval Office. And I haven't shared previously private conversations I've had with the President-elect. I will say that they have been cordial and, in some cases, have involved me making some pretty specific suggestions about how to ensure that regardless of our obvious deep disagreements about policy, maybe I can transmit some thoughts about maintaining the effectiveness, integrity, cohesion of the office, our various democratic institutions. And he has listened. I can't say that he will end up implementing, but the conversations themselves have been cordial as opposed to defensive in any way. And I will always make myself available to him, just as previous Presidents have made themselves available to me as issues come up.With respect to the FBI, I will tell you, I've had a chance to know a lot of FBI agents, I know Director Comey. They take their job seriously, they work really hard, they help keep us safe and save a lot of lives. And it is always a challenge for law enforcement when there's an intersection between the work that they are doing and the political system. It's one of the difficulties of democracy, generally. We have a system where we want our law enforcement investigators and our prosecutors to be free from politics, to be independent, to play it straight, but sometimes, that involves investigations that touch on politics. And particularly in this hyperpartisan environment that we've been in, everything is suspect, everything you do one way or the other.One thing that I have done is to be pretty scrupulous about not wading into investigation decisions or prosecution decisions or decisions not to prosecute. I have tried to be really strict in my own behavior about preserving the independence of law enforcement, free from my own judgments and political assessments, in some cases. And I don't know why I would stop now.Mike Dorning of Bloomberg.

Two weeks ago, Mr. President, your Acting OMB Director was in this room and was talking about what he expects to be GDP growth for this coming year. He said it was 3 percent. And we've talked about the effects of the coronavirus on the supply chain, the declines in the financial markets. Are you still confident that you'll see that kind of economic growth this year?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNo, we're going to have tremendously low unemployment. We're setting records on that one. In fact, the administration has the\u2014as you know, the lowest average unemployment of any administration in history. Our numbers are very low, very good\u20143.5, 3.6. But you can't really see what this does in terms of GDP.It could affect it, but that's irrelevant compared to what we're talking about. We want to make sure it's safe. Safety, number one.But this would have, you know, an impact on GDP. But we're still very, very\u2014we're doing great. But this will\u2014just like\u2014I'll tell you what has a big impact: Boeing has a big impact. How did that happen? A year ago, all of a sudden, that happened. I think that took away a half a point to a point, even. You know, it's a massive company. I think Boeing\u2014we had the General Motors strike; that was a big impact on GDP.And of course, we're paying interest rates. I disagree with the head of the Fed. I'm not happy with what that is, because he's kept interest rates. President Obama didn't have near the numbers. And yet, if you look at what happened, he was paying zero. We're paying interest. Now, it's more conservative. And frankly, people that put their money away are now getting a return on their money as opposed to not getting anything.But I think, you know, we're the greatest of them all. We should be paying the lowest interest rates. And when Germany and other countries are paying negative rates\u2014meaning, they're literally getting paid when they put out money. I mean, they borrow money, and they get paid when it gets paid back. Who ever heard of this before? It's a first. But we don't do that.So I totally disagree with our Fed. I think our Fed has made a terrible mistake, and it would have made a big difference, as good as we've done, even without the 2,000 points. And we started off at 16,000, and we'll be at 28,000 without. We were going to crack 30,000. We have had increases like nobody has seen before. But we're doing well. But we have to watch\u2014we're doing well, anyway, in other words, even despite the 2,000 points. It sounds like a lot, and it's a lot. But it's nothing\u2014it's very little compared to what we've gone up.But we'll be watching it very closely. But we have been hurt by General Motors. We've been hurt by Boeing. And we've hurt by\u2014we've been hurt, in my opinion, very badly, by our own Federal Reserve, who has also created a very strong dollar. That's something nice about a strong dollar, but it makes it much harder to do business outside of this country.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAre you still confident that you'll see that kind of economic growth this year?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

With the increased slowdown in the drawdown here, we're looking at more risk, more danger for U.S. troops that are in Afghanistan. How do you justify that to them? How do you tell them that the mission is still worth it? And how do you assure them that there is an end coming to this mission?And for President Ghani, you've talked the last couple days a lot about the sacrifice of U.S. troops. You were at Arlington earlier today. How do you tell them that this continued sacrifice will be worth it to them as well?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, I think it's important, Leo, to remember the timeline for a withdrawal down to a Embassy-centered presence, a normalization of our presence in Afghanistan remains the end of 2016. So that hasn't changed. Our transition out of a combat role has not changed.Now, I am the first to say that as long as our men and women in uniform are serving in Afghanistan, there are risks involved. It's a dangerous place. Casualties have come down precipitously as we've engaged in the drawdown. It's been over 90 days since two Americans were killed in Afghanistan. That has occurred precisely because we're not in a combat role. And I think it is worth noting the significant casualties that the Afghan security services have incurred. As we've drawn down, they've stood up, and they're fighting. And they're fighting with courage and tenacity, and they're getting better month by month. But you can't minimize the sacrifices that our military families make. It means some folks are going to be rotating back into Afghanistan for a few extra months relative to what otherwise would have been the case. We're essentially moving the drawdown pace over to the right for several months, in part to compensate for the lengthy period it took for Government formation; in part because we want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to help Afghan security forces succeed so we don't have to go back, so we don't have to respond in an emergency because counterterrorist\u2014or because terrorist activities are being launched out of Afghanistan.We're on the path to do that, and it was my assessment as Commander in Chief that it made sense for us to provide a few extra months for us to be able to help on things like logistics, making sure that equipment is not just in place, but it's also used properly; that the training and advising and strategic input that's been provided continues through this fighting season, in part so that President Karzai [Ghani]*, who has taken on the mantle of Commander in Chief in a way that we have not seen in the past from an Afghan President, can do a serious review and can assess here is where our strengths are, here's where our weaknesses are, and we can proceed with more effective joint planning going forward.So the bottom line is our men and women in uniform make enormous sacrifices. Their families do too; they serve alongside them. This will mean that there are going to be some of our folks who are in Afghanistan under the new schedule who would have been home. But it is important to keep in perspective, first of all, that we've gone down from 100,000 down to under 10,000; that they are not on the front lines because they're not in a combat role. We are doing all that we can do to make sure that force protection is a priority for those who are in Afghanistan. And the date for us to have completed our drawdown will not change.But it is my judgment, it's the judgment of General Campbell and others who are on the ground, that providing this additional timeframe during this fighting season for us to be able to help the Afghan security forces succeed is well worth it. And in that sense, once again, we are asking our men and women in uniform to fight on behalf of our freedom and on behalf of a more orderly world.It does, perhaps, raise one thought, which is, right now there's a debate going up on Capitol Hill about budgets. This would be a good time for my friends up on Capitol Hill, including on the other side of the aisle, to take a look at their budgets. If we're holding both our defense and nondefense budgets to 2006 levels, it's a lot harder for us to do the job that we need to do not only on the national security side, but also here at home, making sure that when our men and women come home, and when they potentially go into civilian life, that they've got a strong economy, that their kids have good schools, that they can send their kids to college, that they get the veterans benefits that they have so richly earned and deserve. That would be a good way for us to express the thanks for the sacrifices they consistently make. I met yesterday the widow of General Greene. She would like the memory of her husband to be preserved by a sustainable Afghanistan that is secure. The 2,215 Americans that have died must not die in vain. They must leave behind a legacy of a stable Afghanistan. And it's that preservation of those gains that I think inspires the American service men and women to obey the call of their commander, the order of their commanders.Second, we have taken them out of the harm's way. As the President mentioned, for the past 100 days, because the combat role has ended, the exposure, the number of casualties is really down. There isn't\u2014my most horrible reading of the day is my first, middle-of-the-day, and end-of-the-day security reports where I see the casualties of the Afghan figures. But thank God they're no longer American or European casualties.John Campbell is making sure that they remain in support role. Their train, advise, assist role has risks, but they're nowhere comparable to combat role. And end of that combat role is very significant to this. And again, the institutional gains that would be achieved through the train, advise, and assist role is what will guarantee that the investments of the last 14 years pay off in terms of gains that would ensure.Last point: Afghanistan is the front line. Because of American engagement in Afghanistan, there have not been attacks on mainland United States. But let's not forget that fortresses cannot be built around countries or continents. We are living in an interconnected world, and our security is joined together./U.S. Military Operations in Afghanistan/Afghan Security Forces\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow do you assure U.S. troops that there is an end coming to this mission?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. When you were running for President, you said: The biggest problems we're facing right now have to do with George Bush trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch and not go through Congress at all. And that's what I intend to reverse. So my question to you: Has Congress's inability to do anything significant given you a green light to push the limits of executive power, even a duty to do so? Or put another way, does it bother you more to be accused of being an imperial President, pushing those limits or to be accused of being a do-nothing President who couldn't get anything done because you faced a dysfunctional Congress?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I think that I never have a green light. I'm bound by the Constitution; I'm bound by separation of powers. There are some things we can't do.Congress has the power of the purse, for example. I would love to fund a large infrastructure proposal right now that would put millions of people to work and boost our GDP. We know we've got roads and bridges and airports and electrical grids that need to be rebuilt. But without the cooperation of Congress, what I can do is speed up the permitting process, for example. I can make sure that we're working with the private sector to see if we can channel investment into much-needed projects. But ultimately, Congress has to pass a budget and authorize spending. So I don't have a green light.What I am consistently going to do is, wherever I have the legal authorities to make progress on behalf of middle class Americans and folks working to get into the middle class, whether it's by making sure that Federal contractors are paying a fair wage to their workers, making sure that women have the opportunity to make sure that they're getting paid the same as men for doing the same job, where I have the capacity to expand some of the student loan programs that we've already put in place so that repayments are a little more affordable for college graduates\u2014I'm going to take\u2014I'm going to seize those opportunities. And that's what I think the American people expect me to do.My preference in all these instances is to work with Congress, because not only can Congress do more, but it's going to be longer lasting. And when you look at, for example, congressional inaction, and in particular, the inaction on the part of House Republicans, when it comes to immigration reform, now, here's an area where, as I've said before, not only the American people want to see action, not only is there 80 percent overlap between what Republicans say they want and Democrats say they want, we actually passed a bill out of the Senate that was bipartisan.And in those circumstances, what the American people expect is that, despite the differences between the parties, there should at least be the capacity to move forward on things we agree on. And that's not what we're seeing right now. So in the face of that kind of dysfunction, what I can do is scour our authorities to try to make progress.And we're going to make sure that every time we take one of these steps that we are working within the confines of my executive power. But I promise you, the American people don't want me just standing around twiddling my thumbs and waiting for Congress to get something done. Even as we take these executive actions, I'm going to continue to reach out to Democrats and Republicans\u2014to the Speaker, to the leadership on both sides and in both Chambers\u2014to try to come up with formulas where we can make progress, even if it's incremental.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHas Congress's inability to do anything significant given you a green light to push the limits of executive power, even a duty to do so?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday DHS came to an agreement with the Governor of Oregon to remove Federal officers, and Oregon State troopers took over. Mayor Ted Wheeler was noticeably absent from that agreement. Are you confident, sir, that the State of Oregon will be able to quell the protests in Portland? And if the violence does continue, would you consider redeploying Federal troops?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nSo our people have done\u2014Homeland Security have done a fantastic job. They went to Oregon a little more than a week ago. The place was a mess. The city, Portland, was just a disaster. You see it, and a lot of people weren't reporting it right. They tried to pretend it was a protest, as opposed to anarchists and agitators. You understand what I'm saying. It's a mess.They went there a short while ago, and they saved a Federal courthouse that costs hundreds of millions of dollars. And they put a ring around the courthouse, and they saved it. But the group that's there is basically meant to save buildings, and they were very strong, very powerful. And they didn't come out too often out of this cocoon that they built in order to save these very expensive, valuable, and psychologically important buildings\u2014right?\u2014like courthouses.The Governor and the mayor, we've been dealing with them, and we think they don't know what they're doing, because this should not have been going on for 60 days. It's not our job unless, in case of emergency\u2014which I consider now to be an emergency\u2014it's not our job to go in and clean out the cities. That's supposed to be done by local law enforcement.Yesterday the Governor worked a deal where they'll do it; we'll stand by, they'll do it\u2014and that's good. That was very good, but she didn't report it that way. What she reported was totally different. She said, I think Trump wants to take over the country. It's crazy.So what happened is, our people are staying there to see whether or not they can do it today and tomorrow. And if they don't do it, we will send in the National Guard and we'll take care of it. And we're telling, right now, these protesters\u2014and many should be arrested, because these are professional agitators, these are professional anarchists; these are people that hate our country. We're telling them, right now, that we're coming in very soon, the National Guard. A lot of people. A lot of very tough people. And these are not people that just have to guard the courthouse and save it. These are people that are allowed to go forward and do what they have to do. And I think that makes the Governor's job and the mayor's job a lot easier. So they're working today and probably tomorrow to clean out this beehive of terrorists. And if they do it, I'm going to be very happy. And then, slowly, we can start to leave the city. If they don't do it, we'll be sending in the National Guard.Please.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAre you confident, sir, that the State of Oregon will be able to quell the protests in Portland?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. There's a perception that you're letting President Putin get away with interfering in the U.S. election and that a response that nobody knows about or a look-back review just don't cut it. Are you prepared to call out President Putin by name for ordering this hacking? And do you agree with what Hillary Clinton now says, that the hacking was actually partially responsible for her loss? And is your administration's open quarreling with Trump and his team on this issue tarnishing the smooth transition of power that you have promised?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, with respect to the transition, I think they would be the first to acknowledge that we have done everything we can to make sure that they are successful as I promised. And that will continue. And it's just been a few days since I last talked to the President-elect about a whole range of transition issues. That cooperation is going to continue.There hasn't been a lot of squabbling. What we've simply said is the facts, which are that, based on uniform intelligence assessments, the Russians were responsible for hacking the DNC and that, as a consequence, it is important for us to review all elements of that and make sure that we are preventing that kind of interference through cyber attacks in the future.That should be a bipartisan issue; that shouldn't be a partisan issue. And my hope is that the President-elect is going to similarly be concerned with making sure that we don't have potential foreign influence in our election process. I don't think any American wants that. And that shouldn't be a source of an argument.I think that part of the challenge is that it gets caught up in the carryover from election season. And I think it is very important for us to distinguish between the politics of the election and the need for us, as a country, both from a national security perspective, but also in terms of the integrity of our election system and our democracy, to make sure that we don't create a political football here.Now, with respect to how this thing unfolded last year, let's just go through the facts pretty quickly. At the beginning of the summer, we're alerted to the possibility that the DNC has been hacked, and I immediately order law enforcement as well as our intelligence teams to find out everything about it, investigate it thoroughly, to brief the potential victims of this hacking, to brief on a bipartisan basis the leaders of both the House and the Senate and the relevant intelligence committees. And once we had clarity and certainty around what, in fact, had happened, we publicly announced that, in fact, Russia had hacked into the DNC.And at that time, we did not attribute motives or any interpretations of why they had done so. We didn't discuss what the effects of it might be. We simply let people know\u2014the public know, just as we had let Members of Congress know\u2014that this had happened. And as a consequence, all of you wrote a lot of stories about both what had happened, and then you interpreted why that might have happened and what effect it was going to have on the election outcomes. We did not. And the reason we did not was because in this hyperpartisan atmosphere, at a time when my primary concern was making sure that the integrity of the election process was not in any way damaged, at a time when anything that was said by me or anybody in the White House would immediately be seen through a partisan lens, I wanted to make sure that everybody understood we were playing this thing straight, that we weren't trying to advantage one side or another, but what we were trying to do was let people know that this had taken place, and so if you started seeing effects on the election, if you were trying to measure why this was happening and how you should consume the information that was being leaked, that you might want to take this into account.And that's exactly how we should have handled it. Imagine if we had done the opposite. It would have become immediately just one more political scrum. And part of the goal here was to make sure that we did not do the work of the leakers for them by raising more and more questions about the integrity of the election right before the election was taking place; at a time, by the way, when the President-elect himself was raising questions about the integrity of the election.And finally, I think it's worth pointing out that the information was already out. It was in the hands of WikiLeaks, so that was going to come out no matter what. What I was concerned about, in particular, was making sure that that wasn't compounded by potential hacking that could hamper vote counting, affect the actual election process itself.And so in early September, when I saw President Putin in China, I felt that the most effective way to ensure that that didn't happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out and there were going to be some serious consequences if he didn't. And in fact, we did not see further tampering of the election process. But the leaks through WikiLeaks had already occurred.So when I look back in terms of how we handled it, I think we handled it the way it should have been handled. We allowed law enforcement and the intelligence community to do its job without political influence. We briefed all relevant parties involved in terms of what was taking place. When we had a consensus around what had happened, we announced it, not through the White House, not through me, but rather through the intelligence communities that had actually carried out these investigations. And then, we allowed you and the American public to make an assessment as to how to weigh that going into the election.And the truth is, is that there was nobody here who didn't have some sense of what kind of effect it might have. I'm finding it a little curious that everybody is suddenly acting surprised that this looked like it was disadvantaging Hillary Clinton, because you guys wrote about it every day. [] Every single leak. About every little juicy tidbit of political gossip, including John Podesta's risotto recipe. [] This was an obsession that dominated the news coverage.So I do think it's worth us reflecting how it is that a Presidential election of such importance, of such moment, with so many big issues at stake, and such a contrast between the candidates, came to be dominated by a bunch of these leaks. What is it about our political system that made us vulnerable to these kinds of potential manipulations, which, as I've said publicly before, were not particularly sophisticated. This was not some elaborate, complicated espionage scheme. They hacked into some Democratic Party e-mails that contained pretty routine stuff, some of it embarrassing or uncomfortable, because I suspect that if any of us got our e-mails hacked into, there might be some things that we wouldn't want suddenly appearing on the front page of a newspaper or a telecast, even if there wasn't anything particularly illegal or controversial about it. And then, it just took off.And that concerns me. And it should concern all of us. But the truth of the matter is, is that everybody had the information. It was out there. And we handled it the way we should have.Now, moving forward, I think there are a couple of issues that this raises. Number one is just the constant challenge that we are going to have with cybersecurity throughout our economy and throughout our society. We are a digitalized culture, and there is hacking going on every single day. There's not a company, there's not a major organization, there's not a financial institution, there's not a branch of our Government where somebody is not going to be phishing for something or trying to penetrate or put in a virus or malware. And this is why for the last 8 years, I've been obsessed with how do we continually upgrade our cybersecurity systems.And this particular concern around Russian hacking is part of a broader set of concerns about how do we deal with cyber issues being used in ways that can affect our infrastructure, affect the stability of our financial systems, and affect the integrity of our institutions, like our election process.I just received a couple weeks back\u2014it wasn't widely reported on\u2014a report from our cybersecurity Commission that outlines a whole range of strategies to do a better job on this. But it's difficult, because it's not all housed\u2014the target of cyber attacks is not one entity, but it's widely dispersed, and a lot of it is private, like the DNC. It's not a branch of government. We can't tell people what to do. What we can do is inform them, get best practices.What we can also do is to, on a bilateral basis, warn other countries against these kinds of attacks. And we've done that in the past. So just as I told Russia to stop it and indicated there will be consequences when they do it, the Chinese have, in the past, engaged in cyber attacks directed at our companies to steal trade secrets and proprietary technology. And I had to have the same conversation with Prime Minister\u2014or with President Xi, and what we've seen is some evidence that they have reduced, but not completely eliminated, these activities, partly because they can use cutouts.One of the problems with the Internet and cyber issues is that there's not always a return address, and by the time you catch up to it, attributing what happened to a particular Government can be difficult, not always provable in court even though our intelligence communities can make an assessment.What we've also tried to do is to start creating some international norms about this to prevent some sort of cyber arms race, because we obviously have offensive capabilities as well as defensive capabilities. And my approach is not a situation in which everybody is worse off because folks are constantly attacking each other back and forth, but putting some guardrails around the behavior of nation-states, including our adversaries, just so that they understand that whatever they do to us we can potentially do to them.We do have some special challenges, because oftentimes, our economy is more digitalized, it is more vulnerable, partly because we're a wealthier nation and we're more wired than some of these other countries. And we have a more open society and engage in less control and censorship over what happens over the Internet, which is also part of what makes us special.Last point\u2014and the reason I'm going on here is because I know that you guys have a lot of questions about this, and I haven't addressed all of you directly about it\u2014with respect to response, my principal goal leading up to the election was making sure that the election itself went off without a hitch, that it was not tarnished, and that it did not feed any sense in the public that somehow tampering had taken place with the actual process of voting. And we accomplished that.That does not mean that we are not going to respond. It simply meant that we had a set of priorities leading up to the election that were of the utmost importance. Our goal continues to be to send a clear message to Russia or others not to do this to us, because we can do stuff to you.But it is also important for us to do that in a thoughtful, methodical way. Some of it we do publicly. Some of it we will do in a way that they know, but not everybody will. And I know that there have been folks out there who suggest somehow that if we went out there and made big announcements and thumped our chests about a bunch of stuff, that somehow that would potentially spook the Russians. But keep in mind that we already have enormous numbers of sanctions against the Russians. The relationship between us and Russia has deteriorated, sadly, significantly over the last several years. And so how we approach an appropriate response that increases costs for them for behavior like this in the future, but does not create problems for us, is something that's worth taking the time to think through and figure out. And that's exactly what we've done.So at a point in time where we've taken certain actions that we can divulge publicly, we will do so. There are times where the message will go\u2014will be directly received by the Russians and not publicized. And I should point out, by the way, part of why the Russians have been effective on this is because they don't go around announcing what they're doing. It's not like Putin is going around the world publicly saying, look what we did, wasn't that clever? He denies it. So the idea that somehow public shaming is going to be effective, I think, doesn't read the thought process in Russia very well.Okay?\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nIs your administration's open quarreling with Trump and his team on this issue tarnishing the smooth transition of power that you have promised?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

President Trump, thank you. I have two questions, one on testing and one on Democratic States that you've tweeted about. First, the money for this new testing support today comes from the CARE Act\u2014CARES Act, which you signed into law 42 days ago. Did your delay in embracing widespread testing have anything to do with the desire to suppress the official number of U.S. cases and deaths as you try to reopen the country?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNo, we just wanted to make sure that we had the proper machinery apparatus and everything else out there before people started wasting money. It's a method of saving money. We wanted to make sure we had even things like this. Plus, they have machines that are far more complex than this. They have massive machines at some of the laboratories that can do millions of tests. We wanted to make sure everything was in place. Okay?Go ahead.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDelay in embracing widespread testing\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Yes, Mr. President, I'd like to turn your attention back to Capitol Hill. A year ago, after Republicans lost control of Congress, you said you wanted to find common ground. This morning you gave us a pretty scathing report card on Democrats. But I'm wondering, how have you assessed yourself in dealing with Democrats this past year? How effective have you been in dealing with them on various issues, and do you think you've done a good job in finding common ground?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWe're finding common ground on Iraq. We're\u2014I recognize there are people in Congress that say we shouldn't have been there in the first place. But it sounds to me as if the debate has shifted, that David Petraeus and Ryan Crocker's testimony made a difference to a lot of Members. I hope we continue to find ground by making sure our troops get funded.We found common ground on FISA. My only question is, why change a good law? The way that law was written works for the security of the country. That's what the American people want to know, by the way. Are we passing laws that are beneficial to the American people? This law is beneficial because it enables our intelligence experts to\u2014and professionals to find out the intentions of Al Qaida. Now, the law needs to be changed, enhanced by providing the phone companies that allegedly helped us with liability protection. So we found common ground there.Hopefully, we can find common ground as the Congress begins to move pieces of legislation. The reason I said what I said today is, there's a lot to be done. As you recognize, I'm not a member of the legislative branch; probably wouldn't be a very good legislator. But as the head of the executive branch, it makes sense to call upon Congress to show progress and get results. It's hard to find common ground unless important bills are moving. They're not even moving. And not one appropriations bill has made it to my desk. How can you find common ground when there's no appropriations process?We found common ground on a trade bill\u2014trade bills, really important pieces of legislation, as far as I'm concerned. One of the reasons why is, exports helped us overcome the weakness in the housing market last quarter. If that's the case, it seems like it makes sense to continue and open up markets to goods and services. And yet there hadn't been one\u2014there haven't been any bills moving when it comes to trade.Veterans Affairs is an area where we can find common ground. I've called in\u2014I asked Bob Dole and Donna Shalala to lead an important Commission, a Commission to make sure our veterans get the benefits they deserve. I was concerned about bureaucratic delay and the\u2014concerned about a system that had been in place for years, but this didn't recognize this different nature\u2014a different kind of war that we're fighting.I don't like it when I meet wives who are sitting by\u2014beside their husbands' bed in Walter Reed and not being supported by its Government, not being helped to provide care. I'm concerned about PTSD, and I want people to focus on PTSD. And so we sent up a bill, and I hope they move on it quickly. There's a place where we can find common ground, Sheryl.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nEffectiveness in dealing with Democrats on various issues\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

With the news this morning that the U.S. and its allies are returning to the table, are taking up Iran's offer to talk again, more than a year after those talks broke up in frustration, is this Israel's--Iran's last chance to negotiate an end to this nuclear question?And you said 3 years ago--nearly 3 years ago, in a similar one-on-one meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu, that the time for talk--by the end of that year, 2009, you would be considering whether Iran was negotiating in good faith. And you said at that time that we're not going to have talks forever. So here we are nearly 3 years later. Is this it? And did you think you would be here 3 years after those first talks?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYou know, there is no doubt that over the last 3 years, when Iran has engaged in negotiations, there has been hemming and hawing and stalling and avoiding the issues in ways that the international community has concluded were not serious. And my expectations, given the consequences of inaction for them, the severe sanctions that are now being applied, the huge toll it's taking on their economy, the degree of isolation that they're feeling right now, which is unprecedented, they understand that the world community means business.To resolve this issue will require Iran to come to the table and discuss in a clear and forthright way how to prove to the international community that the intentions of their nuclear program are peaceful. They know how to do that. This is not a mystery. And so it's going to be very important to make sure that on an issue like this--there are complexities; it obviously has to be methodical. I don't expect a breakthrough in a first meeting, but I think we will have a pretty good sense fairly quickly as to how serious they are about resolving the issue.And there are steps that they can take that would send a signal to the international community and that are verifiable, that would allow them to be in compliance with international norms, in compliance with international mandates, abiding by the nonproliferation treaty, and provide the world an assurance that they're not pursuing a nuclear weapon. They know how to do it, and the question is going to be whether in these discussions they show themselves moving clearly in that direction.Ed Henry [FOX News].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDid you think you would be here 3 years after those first talks?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

I want to be very clear about that.

You know, I hope that we have quite friendly relations with President Obama, but I try not to give pieces of advice that cannot be fulfilled. This is a hard topic, a difficult one. I can say only two things. First of all, we believe that, at present, the United States and some other countries are assisting the Afghan people in obtaining the much wanted statehood and restore the basis of the functioning of an effective state, restore their civil society and their economy. And in these terms, we will support and back the efforts of the U.S.As far as our own experience, well-known experiences--[inaudible]--I would very much like to see the Afghan people in near future having an effective state and a modern economy, which requires toiling more than a year.

Thank you, sir. With some Republicans saying they need to see measurable progress by September, are you willing to reevaluate troop levels then, based on what General Petraeus says? And also, are you willing to accept any consequences for benchmarks in the war funding bill?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYou know, I meet with a lot of people on the subject of Iraq, and I should. There's a lot of opinions on both sides of the aisle about this issue. And my message to the Members of Congress is, whatever your beliefs may be, let's make sure our troops get funded, and let's make sure politicians don't tell our commanders how to conduct operations. Let's don't hamstring our people in the field. That's my message.Their message to me has been, you know, don't you think the Iraqi Government ought to do more? They recognize what I recognize, and these gentlemen up here particularly recognize: that without political progress, it's going to be hard to achieve a military victory in Iraq. In other words, the military can provide security so a political process can go forward.Look, the two questions you asked: One was about General Petraeus's report to the\u2014back\u2014around September about what's taking place in Baghdad. My attitude toward Congress is, why don't you wait and see what he says? Fund the troops, and let him come back and report to the American people. General Petraeus picked this date. He believes that there will be enough progress one way or the other to be able to report to the American people, to give an objective assessment about what he sees regarding the Baghdad security plan.It's at that point in time that I'm confident that the Secretary and the Joint Chiefs will take a look at what David Petraeus says and make recommendations about troop levels based upon the conditions on the ground, which stands in stark contrast to Members of Congress who say, we're going to determine troop levels based upon politics or the latest opinion poll or how we can get our Members elected.And the second part of your question was about benchmarks. Look, let me talk about this recent effort by Congress to fund our troops. The idea that the House of Representatives put forward is one that we will fund our troops by piecemeal. Secretary Gates was very strong about why that's a bad idea. And the American people must understand that if you fund our troops every 2 months, you're in a\u2014put in a position where we have to delay certain procurement, or that military contracts must be delayed. There's a lot of uncertainty in funding when it comes to 2-month cycles. So we reject that idea. It won't work.I find it odd that the Congress is\u2014I find it ironic that the Congress is ready to fully fund unrelated domestic spending items and only one-half of the money requested for our troops. They provide 100 percent of the money for the special interest projects that\u2014they don't have anything to do with fighting the war on terror, and 50 percent of the money to go to those who wear our uniform. They got it wrong. They ought to provide 100 percent of the money for people who wear the uniform and leave these special pork projects out of the bill. The\u2014and so I'll veto the bill if it's this haphazard, piecemeal funding. And I made that clear.One message I have heard from people from both parties and\u2014is that the idea of benchmarks makes sense. And I agree. It makes sense to have benchmarks as a part of our discussion on how to go forward. And so I've empowered Josh Bolten to find common ground on benchmarks, and he will continue to have dialog with both Republicans and Democrats.You know, this bill\u2014I believe we can get a good supplemental, and I hope it's as quick as possible. The first blush is the bad supplemental coming out of the House. Nevertheless, there is\u2014the Senate will have a say, and then there will be a conference committee, and hopefully, we can move a good bill forward as quickly as possible. These gentlemen will tell you that the longer we wait, the more it hurts our military and the families.Toby [Tabassum Zakaria, Reuters].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAre you willing to reevaluate troop levels in September based on what General Petraeus says?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. In conversations that you've had over the past couple of days with the Asian-Pacific leaders, have any of them brought up the rhetoric that we're seeing from Republican Presidential candidates when it comes to China? And does that kind of rhetoric or posturing jeopardize the progress that your administration has made with China and the Asian-Pacific region as a whole?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI think most leaders here understand that politics is not always measured or on the level, and so most of our discussions have to do with substance: How do we put our people back to work right now? How do we expand trade? How do we expand exports?I've been very frank with Chinese leaders, though, in saying that the American people across the board--left, right, and center--believe in trade, believe in competition. We think we've got the best workers in the world. We think we've got the best universities, the best entrepreneurs, the best free market. We're ready to go out there and compete with anybody. But there is a concern across the political spectrum that the playing field is not level right now.And so in conversations with President Hu and others, what I've tried to say is we have the opportunity to move in a direction in which this is a win-win: is benefiting from trade with the United States; the United States is benefiting as well. Jobs are being created in the United States and not just in . But right now things are out of kilter. And that is something that is shared across the board, as we saw with the recent vote on the Chinese currency issue in the Senate.And I think leaders in the region understand that as grows, as its economic influence expands, that the expectation is, is that they will be a responsible leader in the world economy, which is what the United States has tried to do. I mean, we try to set up rules that are universal, that everybody can follow, and then we play by those rules, and then we compete fiercely. But we don't try to game the system. That's part of what leadership's about. has the opportunity to be that same type of leader. And as the world's second largest economy, I think that's going to be important not just for this region, but for the world.

Well, are these bumps along the road, or are you seeing a deterioration in the relationship, based on the Koran burning itself, the violence that has followed, that inhibits your ability to work out things like how to hand off the detention center?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNo, I--none of this stuff is easy, and it never has been. And obviously, the most recent riots or protests against the Koran burning were tragic, but remember, this happened a while back when a pastor in Florida threatened to burn a Koran. In Iraq, as we were making this transition, there were constant crises that would pop up and tragic events that would take place and there would be occasional setbacks.But what I've tried to do is to set a course, make sure that up and down the chain of command everybody knows what our broader strategy is. And one of the incredible things about our military is that when they know what our objective is, what our goal is, regardless of the obstacles that they meet along the way, they get the job done.And I think that President Karzai understands that we are interested in a strategic partnership with the Afghan people and the Afghan Government. We are not interested in staying there any longer than is necessary to assure that Al Qaida is not operating there and that there is sufficient stability that it doesn't end up being a free-for-all after ISAF has left.And so we share interests here. It will require negotiations, and there will be time where things don't look as smooth as I'd like. That's kind of the deal internationally on a whole range of these issues.All right? Thank you guys.Oh, let--can I just make one other comment?

Chosun Daily News. I have a question for President Bush. The United States has a divergent alliance with countries like the United Kingdom, Japan. In your opinion, President Bush, what kind of alliance do you have with the Republic of Korea? And during your summit meeting today, I believe you agreed to upgrade the Korea-U.S. alliance. In order to upgrade the alliance, what kind of new movement will you take on, for instance, the transfer of wartime operational control? And what will you do, President Bush\u2014do you have any intention to meet with both President Lee and Chairman Kim in order to resolve this issue?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNo\u2014[inaudible]\u2014described the relationship\u2014[inaudible]\u2014a 21st-century strategic alliance. That makes sense to me. So what does that mean? Well, it means we work in ways to deal with 21st-century problems, such as proliferation of nuclear materials, such as working to make sure our children are educated with the tools necessary to be productive citizens, such as having a recognition that in the 21st century, a free and fair trading system will be necessary for prosperity. And that's why it's going to be very important for our Congress to ratify the free trade agreement with Korea.It's going to be very important a 21stcentury alliance recognizes that China is a opportunity for both nations to engage in a constructive way. Well, we have our problems with China, of course, whether it be human rights or how the Chinese leadership deals with the Dalai Lama or with Burma, a variety of issues. On the other hand, you can either have a constructive relationship\u2014we can work constructively with China\u2014or we can have a destructive relationship. I've chosen to have a constructive relationship.And so the step one is to anticipate the issues confronting our peoples in the 21st century, and step two is to develop a practical way to deal with those issues. And that's exactly what our conversation revolved around. And I'm confident that this meeting has strengthened our relationship, and I'm confident that the American people understand how important this relationship is to our own prosperity and our own security.And so it's been a really good visit, and we're glad you came here too. [] Yes. Thanks for coming.

But can you talk us through a bit more on the focus on distributing to minorities and how that would work?And then for you, Mr. President, you mentioned the drop in the poverty rate. Specifically, we noticed at\u2014just the news that the poverty rate for African Americans hit historic lows, that the household wealth increased historically for African Americans. What was driving that increase in wealth for African Americans?And now, in 2020, with the coronavirus, with unemployment spiking, what would be your plan for the second term to improve lives for African Americans?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I'll go first, because of your question\u2014I appreciate your question. And yes, we've had a tremendous drop in poverty for all people in our Nation, but in particular for African Americans. And that statistic came in. And it's because the African American community, the Black community has had the lowest\u2014the best employment numbers that we've ever had\u2014both employment and unemployment, depending on how you want to define it.But we've had the best employment numbers we've ever had. Now, we had the greatest employment in the country ever, almost 160 million people. We've never been close to that number, but we were just 6 months ago.And yes, the\u2014I'm very proud of the numbers. African Americans, Hispanic Americans\u2014they had the best numbers they've ever had, by far\u2014both employment and unemployment, depending on definition.Thank you very much for that question. Scott, do you want to answer that too? Okay. Yes, so what I\u2014to clarify, I said that the first prioritization is the high-risk people and frontline health care workers.But just to reiterate, what I said, there are 51,000 outlets for distribution for vaccination, and there's over 14,000 Federally ualified Health Centers that are particularly targeted to minority and low-income areas. So that's a focus.And I want to point out two other things. We're also prioritizing testing at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and we're in the process of getting that finalized because we know that there's high\u2014there's a higher morbidity with\u2014in certain ethnic groups.And last thing I would say is, it's particularly heinous\u2014an egregious abuse of the media to instill fear into people about taking a vaccine, because there is no shortcut here. Everything is safe. Everything is effective. And for people who have particularly an influence on minority communities to instill fear and doubt is a particularly, you know, outrageous abuse of public policy and of leadership. These are people that have higher risk.And so I implore everyone who is in a high-risk category that when we get a safe, effective vaccine, they should take the vaccine. . I will say, this is a phenomena that only happened when they realized that we may very well have the vaccine prior to a certain very important date, namely November 3. Once they heard that, the Democrats started\u2014just to show you how bad the intention is, they started knocking the vaccine. Had nothing to do with a vaccine, it was totally made up. It's all disinformation.Just like they put an ad in about football. Just like they put\u2014with respect to me. I'm the one that got football back. And I was always against them going out. It was ridiculous that Big Ten and now, hopefully, Pac-10 [Pac-12]* goes back.And I say that, just like\u2014even worse, they put out a totally fake ad, totally made-up story. It was a made-up story by a third-rate magazine, where the head guy\u2014I guess, the head person\u2014I have no idea who he is; I don't know him, but he's friends with Obama and Clinton. So they made up this horrible story, and then they did ads. Well, they made up this story too.This story is very simple: They started knocking the vaccine as soon as they heard that this actually may come out prior to election. Now, it may or may not, but it will be within a matter of weeks. It will be within a matter of weeks from November. It's ready to go and it's ready to\u2014for massive distribution to everybody\u2014with a focus, again, on seniors.And I will say, also, the Historically Black Colleges and Universities, we are doing, at my suggestion\u2014because they have had a difficult problem there\u2014we are doing more testing there and finer testing. We have our great apparatus there.But we\u2014when you look at what we've done on testing, in terms of the technology and the amount, it's been really amazing. In fact, I think we're going to crack a hundred million tests very soon, in the very near future. We're going to be cracking a hundred million tests.Now what that does do is, it shows up more cases. If we didn't test, we wouldn't have cases. You would have no cases. Other countries, they don't test; they don't have cases. And then they say, Oh, the United States\u2014well\u2014but we're proud of it, because it shows where there may be a problem, and it helps people. But we're doing tremendous testing at the Historically Black Colleges and Universities. And that was a suggestion I made, and I think it's a good suggestion.Yes, please, go ahead.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nCan you talk us through a bit more on the focus on distributing to minorities and how that would work?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Awesome.I've got a couple of questions for you. Number one, you said that you want to convey your message by getting out there in the country. I wonder if you're planning on traveling also to South America and other countries in the Western Hemisphere, given the fact that China has gained a lot of influence in the region?And the second question is: What would be your message for residents in this country that are struggling every time they go to the gas station, every time they go to the grocery store and see the prices going high\u2014and the pharmacy? I happen to come from South Texas. What I saw a lot of\u2014a lot of people struggling financially in the last few months. And so I think you\u2014I wonder what is the message you want to spread to them?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I try to express\u2014I've asked\u2014I've tried to answer that seven different ways today about how to deal with inflation. But let me answer the first question.I've spent a lot of time in South America and in Latin America. When I was Vice President, I spent the bulk of my 8 years basically in Europe and/or in Latin America. I'm in contact with the leaders of the countries in South America, and we're working closely with making sure that we do everything\u2014for example, with the\u2014to deal with helping the countries in question, particularly those in Central America, to be able to help them with their ability to deal with the internal\u2014people don't sit around in Guatemala and say: I've got a great idea: Let's sell everything we have, give the money to a coyote, take us across a terribly dangerous trip up through Central America and up through Mexico, and drop us\u2014sneak us across the border, drop us in the desert. Won't that be fun?People leave because they have real problems. And one of the things that I've done, when I was a Vice President, and got support with\u2014although I don't have much Republican support anymore\u2014is provide billions of dollars to be able to say to those countries, Why are people leaving? And how are you going to reform your own system? And that's what we've worked on a long time. It still needs a lot more work. And we're focusing on that.I also believe\u2014I've spent a lot of time talking about and dealing with policy having to do with Maduro, who is little more than a dictator right now, and the same thing in Chile and\u2014not the same thing, but with Chile, as well as Argentina.So, look, I made a speech a while ago, when I was Vice President, saying that if we were smart, we have an opportunity to make the Western Hemisphere a united\u2014not united\u2014a democratic hemisphere. And we were moving in the right direction under our\u2014under the last administration\u2014the Obama-Biden administration.But so much damage was done as a consequence of the foreign policy decisions the last President made in Latin America, Central America, and South America that we now have\u2014when I call for a Summit of the Democracies\u2014I called that, and a number of nations showed up for this Summit of Democracy\u2014what is it that's going to allow us to generate\u2014we've actually had a reduction in the number of democracies in the world. And it seems to me there's nothing more important.We used to talk about, when I was a kid in college, about America's backyard. It's not America's backyard. Everything south of the Mexican border is America's front yard. And we're equal people. We don't dictate what happens in any other part of that\u2014of this continent or the South American continent. We have to work very hard on it.But the trouble is, we're having great difficulty making up for the mistakes that were made the last 4 years, and it's going to take some time.Yes. Gentleman in the back. And then I'll go to this side, okay?\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAre you planning on traveling to South America and other countries in the Western Hemisphere given China's influence in the region?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Mr. President, Ross Palombo from ABC News Miami. As a relatively new Floridian, what is your message today to the cruise line industry and the travel industry that Florida depends upon? And since Senator Rick Scott and Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gim\u00e9nez have the same exposure as you, and they are self-isolating, what's your message to them, that they shouldn't be?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I don't know that I had exposure, but I don't have any of the symptoms.And we do have a White House doctor and, I should say, many White House doctors, frankly. And I asked them that same question, and they said, You don't have any symptoms whatsoever. And we don't want people without symptoms to go and do the test. The test is not insignificant.As far as the cruise line business, we're with them all the way. It's a great business. It's a great U.S. business, frankly. And I know how important they are to the country. That includes airlines. But the cruise line business, obviously, was hit very hard.We had a tremendous success out in Oakland where we moved it. Vice President Pence did a fantastic job with that. We worked with U.K. We worked with Canada. They took their people back. And Canada has approximately 600 people; U.K., likewise, took a large number of people back to the United Kingdom.And we have people quarantined. It was a big operation, and it worked out really\u2014you don't hear about it anymore. It worked out really well.Mike, you may even want to say something about that because that was really done properly. Well, thank you, Mr. President. And that program with the Grand Princess, the ship, is continuing to be administered in the highest standards, orderly way, as the President directed. And Americans that needed treatment have received them.[]And what the President has directed us to do is, whether there is a pause in the moment, as some cruise lines are doing, and as we all continue to discuss, we want to work with the cruise line industry to ensure that when we come through this, that cruise lines and the medical services that are available, and for the passengers and all of the crew, that cruise lines are safer than ever before and can prosper for many years to come.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nMr. President, as a relatively new Floridian, what is your message today to the cruise line industry and the travel industry that Florida depends upon?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

But nobody else that came here got the kind of reception we got.We have been\u2014we gave\u2014it was 125,000, I think, seats they had yesterday. They were full. You had thousands and thousands of people outside. Prime Minister Modi was telling me thousands of people outside.That's not uncommon for me, to be honest with you. But when I look at 125,000 seats\u2014and that was an incredible scene yesterday. In addition, all of those people lined up from the airport to the event, it was an incredible thing. Nobody has ever seen anything like it.The Ambassador just told me that he's been in India for a long time. He's never seen\u2014in fact, both Ambassadors, our Ambassador and the Ambassador from India, said, in 40 years, he's never seen anything like it, what took place yesterday and, you know, earlier than that. But yesterday\u2014they've never seen anything like it.So it was a great compliment. It was a great compliment to our country. I'm the leader of the country, but it was a great compliment to our country. But Prime Minister Modi said today they've never, ever had any event like that. In fact, they said usually when somebody comes in, they have to look for people to fill up the areas. They said we had\u2014there was something very special.Look, it's a massive country in terms of its population. And people just wanted to see. They wanted to pay their respect to the United States, and so I appreciate it.

Have you--you've talked with economists, you said that economists have agreed that a deal needs to be made. Have you worked with new U.S. business leaders at all to lobby Congress to raise the debt ceiling? And if so, who are you talking to?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI have spoken extensively to business leaders. And I'll be honest with you: I think that business leaders in the abstract want to see a resolution to this problem. What I've found is that they are somewhat hesitant to weigh in on some of these issues even if they're willing to say something privately to me, partly because they've got a whole bunch of business pending before Congress and they don't want to make anybody mad.So this is a problem of our politics and our politicians, but it's not exclusively a problem of our politics and our politicians. I mean, the business community is a lot like everybody else, which is we want to cut everybody else's stuff and we want to keep our stuff. We want to cut our taxes, but if you want to raise revenue with somebody else's taxes, that's okay. And that kind of mindset is why we never get the problem solved.There have been business leaders, like Warren Buffett, who I think have spoken out forcefully on this issue. I think some of the folks who participated in the Bowles-Simpson Commission made very clear that they would agree to a balanced approach even if it meant for them, individually, that they were seeing slightly higher taxes on their income, given that they're--I think the average CEO, if I'm not mistaken, saw a 23-percent raise this past year while the average worker saw a 0- to 1-percent raise last year.So I think that there are a lot of well-meaning businesspeople out there who recognize the need to make something happen. But I think that they've been hesitant to be as straightforward as I'd like when it says, this is what a balanced package means. It means that we've got some spending cuts, it means that we've got some increased revenue, and it means that we're taking on some of the drivers of our long-term debt and deficits.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHave you worked with new U.S. business leaders at all to lobby Congress to raise the debt ceiling?

Thank you so much, sir. Good evening. You mentioned your sitdown with Vladimir Putin and Russian aggression that came up in your conversations today. I'd like to ask you two questions, if I may, on that front. Is it your sense, walking into this meeting, that Americans back home shouldn't expect much in terms of an outcome? Could you provide some specifics on what a successful meeting would look like to you? Are there going to be specific concessions you want Putin to make?And then, I'll just give you my follow-up right now. You've met Vladimir Putin before. What have you learned about him that informs how you approach this sitdown with him? And what's your mindset walking into a meeting with a former KGB agent who you've said has no soul?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI'll tell you all that when it's over.Look, I've been doing this a long time. The last thing anyone would do is negotiate in front of the world press as to how he's going to approach a critical meeting with another adversary and/or someone who could be an adversary. It's the last thing I'm going to do.But I will tell you this: I'm going to make clear to President Putin that there are areas where we can cooperate, if he chooses. And if he chooses not to cooperate and acts in a way that he has in the past, relative to cybersecurity and some other activities, then we will respond. We will respond in kind.There need not be\u2014we should decide where it's in our mutual interest, in the interest of the world, to cooperate, and see if we can do that.

I've also make it clear\u2014made it clear that you can't solve a problem diplomatically unless there are other people at the table with you. And that is why we have been pursuing multilateral diplomacy when it comes to convincing the ians that the free world is sincere about, you know, insisting that they not have the technologies necessary to develop a nuclear weapon.And we're making progress along those lines.

The Governors are going to want to make sure everything is safe. Now, I think that companies can do testing on a, maybe, weekly basis; you don't have to do it every day with the same worker, but they can do testing. They can do temperature gauges. They can do a lot of different things.And you know, we're only talking about for a period of time. You know, eventually, we want to get back to where we were. We want people actually sitting next to each other in ballgames, eventually. You know, we're not going to rip out every other seat in baseball stadiums and football stadiums. We want to go back to where we were.I want people to understand that. We're not going to be like the way you are. We have 300 reporters in the back that want to sit.

I've never seen anything\u2014John, I've never seen anything quite like it. But there are a lot of people\u2014we don't want this. I don't want this. I don't want this.Eventually, we're going back, where restaurants that had 150 seats are going to have 150 seats, not 50 seats, because they can't make it at 50 seats. But more importantly, the atmosphere is even better. We have to get used to it. We have to get used to. I don't know that people are going to be shaking hands as readily. Some will.I said to some of the hospital people today, So will people be shaking hands again? And I must say, I was a little surprised most of them said, Probably, because there is some kind of a thing to it. I was never a big hand shaker, but when I ran for politics, I said, I think I better start shaking people's hands.Go ahead, John.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAssurance to workers who are asked to go back to work, but are fearful of doing so.\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions for you and then some for Chancellor Merkel as well. Your administration, tomorrow, is issuing a business advisory for Hong Kong. I was wondering if you can explain why you think that is necessary.And then, secondly, on your Build Back Better agenda, have you spoken to Senators Manchin and Sinema about the $3.5 trillion framework, and are you confident that they'll be on board at that level? And if they demand that you lose some components, will you be able to keep progressives on board?[At this point, the reporter spoke in German, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]I wanted to ask you whether you have a feeling that, after the talk with President Biden, he better understands your viewpoint as regards China or whether the situation is still tense, whether there is still decoupling. And secondly, whether you think that the United States has contributed enough to vaccinate the rest of the world, or do you think it's only\u2014is it appropriate for children in the United States being vaccinated\u2014children below the age of 12, while adults in other countries have no chance to get vaccinated?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThat's all? [] I thought I said we'd take two questions, but I guess that translated to, we'd take two questions or more from each person called on.Let me talk about the business advisory. The situation in Hong Kong is deteriorating. And the Chinese Government is not keeping its commitment that it made how it would deal with Hong Kong. And so it is more of an advisory as to what may happen in\u2014on Hong Kong. It's as simple as that and as complicated as that.With regard to am I confident?\u2014I'm supremely confident that everything is going to work out perfectly in terms\u2014[]. Look, I understand why the press, among others, is skeptical that I can actually get this deal done on infrastructure and on human infrastructure. And I've watched and listened, and the press declared my initiative dead at least 10 times so far.I don't think it's dead. I think it's still alive. I still have confidence we're going to be able to get what I proposed and what I've agreed to in the bipartisan agreement on infrastructure. I've gotten\u2014we've each committed\u2014I trust the members of\u2014the Republican Senators who have made the commitments relative to how we should proceed and what would be included in the package for infrastructure. And they're men and women of honor, and I expect they would keep their commitment.With regard to the further issue of what's going on and what will confuse the listening audience\u2014but reconciliation\u2014that is the mechanism by which you have to get every single Democrat to agree to proceed on matters like what I announced today.Today\u2014I don't know whether you have any children; it's none of my business whether you do, but if you do, you're going to get\u2014if you're making less than $150,000\u2014you're going to get a significant stipend that is a tax cut. If you have a child under the age of 7 years old, you're going to get\u2014in your bank account today, you're going to get a payment of one-sixth\u201412 months divided\u2014$3,600\u2014$3,700 for that child divided by 12 every month, just like a Social Security check. It's expected to reduce poverty\u2014child poverty by over 40 percent. And it could be a significant, significant game changer.We have mechanisms to pay for both these mechanisms. And there may be some last-minute discussion as to who\u2014what mechanism is used to pay for each of these items, both the infrastructure package and the human infrastructure package. But I believe we will get it done.Thank you. We talked about China, and there is a lot of common understanding that China, in many areas, is our competitor; that trade with China needs to rest on the assumption that we have a level playing field so that we all play by the same rules, have the same standards. That, incidentally, was also the driving force behind the EU-China agreement on trade that they abide by the core labor norms of ILO.And we are convinced of ours\u2014needing to be technological leaders for our two countries in many, many areas. Obviously, it's legitimate for China wishing to do this as well, but, forexample, we will cooperate in many technological state-of-the-art technologies, for example, CHIPS. I think the act that the President launched is fundamental in this respect and crucial.And we want to trade together at a time of digitalization where security issues loom very large in our agendas. We ought to have an exchange on this; we ought to talk about this; we ought to talk about norms, standards that govern the internet; whether we can agree on common norms. I think, particularly as regards to the relationship of us with China, we ought to coordinate our efforts. We do that in the European Union, and we should do it with the United States.And then, there are interests, obviously: sometimes divergent interests, but sometimes common interests. But we also have, obviously, areas where American companies compete with European companies, and we have to accept that. But I think, basically, the rules as to how we deal with China ought to rest and do rest on our shared values.And I think, on the pandemic, we are obviously of the opinion that the pandemic\u2014we can only master the pandemic if each and every one is vaccinated. We are trying to boost production. We are trying also to get as many people in our country vaccinated as possible\u2014which obviously opens us up to criticism of those countries who as yet have not had the chance, which is why we invested a lot of money in COVAX, which is why we encourage our companies to increase their production of vaccines.And, in Africa, we are trying to help Africans to upskill people so that they, too, can have their own production sites.

Very short one for each of you. Mr. President, my question\u2014my first question touches an issue that worries a lot of people in the U.S. and in Germany. Can you explain to us why there still is a travel ban for people coming from Germany or other states of the European Union, while people from Turkey, where the number of new cases are seven times as high, can come?You all have repeatedly said that you're following scientific data. What is the main argument for not lifting that travel ban for the Schengen region?And, Chancellor Merkel\u2014\u2014[The reporter spoke in German, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]You talked to the business companies here. You heard their concerns. You heard their headaches. Some have threatened that they're going to shift business away from the United States. What was your main argument to work for a lifting of the travel ban? And have you had success with this?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWe brought in the head of our COVID team because the Chancellor brought that subject up. It's in the process of seeing how soon we can lift the ban\u2014it's in process now. And I'll be able to answer that question to you within the next several days\u2014what is likely to happen. I'm waiting to hear from our folks and our COVID team as to when that should be done. And the Chancellor did raise it. [] I did raise the issue, yes, and got the same answer that the President gave you just now. The COVID team is evaluating the matter. We had an exchange on\u2014in both areas.The Delta variant actually being on the increase, that is, again, a new challenge to both of us. And obviously, before such a decision, one has to reflect, and it has to be a sustainable decision. It is certainly not sensible to have to take it back after only a few days. So I'm\u2014have every confidence in the American COVID team. Having been here many times, if we don't leave right now, we're going to miss dinner. Chancellor and I have a dinner with some\u2014a number of folks, and very shortly.So thank you for your attention. And thank you for your questions. Thank you.

I'll ask you about Iraq. Efforts to curtail the deployment of troops is an ongoing debate right now. One of the things you spoke about in your address last week had to do with impatience with the Iraqi Government. And you spoke about that, but not in much detail. How is that dynamic changing, your level of frustration with the lack of political progress? And how long can Americans reasonably expect you to wait before you take some kind of action that really forces the Iraqi Government's hand to reach the goals of reconciliation that you set for them?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nIn my speech, I made it clear that there has to be a change in security for there to be reconciliation. And I also said that progress will yield fewer troops. In other words, return on success is what I said.There are two types of reconciliation, David. One is that reconciliation, that very visible reconciliation that happens through the passage of law. In other words, it's reconciliation that shows the i people that people from different backgrounds can get along and, at the same time, that Government can function. Clearly, there needs to be work there. In other words, there needs to be the passage of law. For example, we strongly believe that an oil revenue sharing law will send a message to Sunni, Shi'a, and Kurd alike that there is an effort at the national level to achieve reconciliation.Having said that, however, there is a functioning government. And the reason I bring\u2014I guess my point is this, that in spite of the fact they haven't passed a law, there is the sharing of oil revenues on a relatively equitable basis. The other\u2014and so we'll continue to work with the Government to insist and impress upon them the need for there to be the passage of law, whether it be Provincial election laws or de-Ba'athification law or the oil law.There is local reconciliation taking place. I had a fascinating conversation in the Roosevelt Room earlier this week with members of Provincial Reconstruction Teams from around , who talked about how people are sick and tired of murder and violence and that they expect their local governments and their central Government to be more responsive to their needs. And local governments are beginning to respond.Part of the reason why there is not this kind of instant democracy in is because people are still recovering from Sad-dam Hussein's brutal rule. I thought an interesting comment was made when somebody said to me\u2014I heard somebody say, where's Mandela? Well, Mandela is dead because Saddam Hussein killed all the Mandelas. He was a brutal tyrant that divided people up and split families, and people are recovering from this. So there's a psychological recovery that is taking place. And it's hard work for them. And I understand it's hard work for them. Having said that, I'm not going to give them a pass when it comes to the central Government's reconciliation efforts.I also said in my speech, local politics will drive national politics. And I believe that. I believe that as more reconciliation takes place at the local level, you'll see a more responsive central Government.Yes.

Well, I appreciate that, sir. Thank you very much. Mr. President, Vladimir Putin\u2014\u2014[At this point, a microphone was brought to Mr. Lemire.] Q. \u2014\u2014thank you. Vladimir Putin, who you'll be seeing in a few days in Geneva, said just a couple of days ago that he believed that U.S.-Russia relations were at a low point. In what concrete ways could your summit change that?And then, secondly, on the same topic: You have said previously, and in the runup to the summit, that you would be unafraid to call out Russia's disruptive actions\u2014like cyber hacks, Ukraine, election interference\u2014but you're not having a joint press conference with Putin. Why not take the chance to stand side by side with him and say those things to him with the world watching?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\n[] Well, let me make it clear: I think he's right it's a low point, and it depends on how he responds to acting consistent with international norms, which, in many cases, he has not.As I told him when I was running and when I got elected, before it was\u2014I was sworn in, that I was going to find out whether or not he, in fact, did engage in trying to interfere in our election; that I was going to take a look at whether he was involved in the\u2014a cybersecurity breach that occurred, et cetera; and if I did, I was going to respond.I did; I checked it out. So I had access to all the intelligence. He was engaged in those activities. I did respond and made it clear that I'd respond again.With regard to\u2014I always found\u2014and I don't mean to suggest that the press should not know\u2014but this is not a contest about who can do better in front of a press conference or try to embarrass each other. It's about making myself very clear what the conditions are to get a better relationship are\u2014with Russia.We're not looking for conflict. We are looking to resolve those actions which we think are inconsistent with international norms, number one. Number two, where we can work together, we may be able to do that in terms of some strategic doctrine that may be able to be worked together. We're ready to do it. And there may be other areas. There's even talk there may be the ability to work together on climate.So the bottom line is that I think the best way to deal with this is for he and I to meet, he and I to have our discussion. I know you don't doubt that I'll be very straightforward\u2014[]\u2014with him about our concerns. And I will make clear my view of how that meeting turned out, and he'll make clear how\u2014from his perspective, how it turned out.But I don't want to get into being diverted by: Did they shake hands? How far did they\u2014who talked the most, and the rest. Now, he can say what he said the meeting was about, and I will say what I think the meeting was about.That's how I'm going to handle it.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhy are you not having a joint press conference with Putin during the summit?

Thank you, Mr. President. Does the United States want to maintain permanent bases in Iraq? And I would follow that by asking, are you willing to renounce a claim on permanent bases in Iraq?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nJim, any decisions about permanency in Iraq will be made by the . And frankly, it's not in much of a position to be thinking about what the world is going to look like 5 or 10 years from now. They are working to make sure that we succeed in the short term. And they need our help, and that's where our focus is.But remember, when you're talking about bases and troops, we're dealing with a sovereign government. Now, we entered into an agreement with the Karzai Government. They weren't called permanent bases, but they were called arrangements that will help this Government understand that there will be a U.S. presence so long as they want them there. And at the appropriate time, I'm confident we'll be willing to sit down and discuss the long-term security of Iraq. But right now we're discussing how to bring security to Baghdad and what do we do in Al Anbar Province, where Al Qaida still uses violent methods to achieve political objectives.You know, it's interesting, if you\u2014I'm sure people who watch your TV screens think the entire country is embroiled in sectarian conflict and that there's constant killing everywhere in Iraq. Well, if you listened to General Casey yesterday, 90 percent of the action takes place in 5 of the 18 Provinces. And around Baghdad, it's within a 30-mile area. And the reason I bring that up is that while it seems to our American citizens that nothing normal is taking place\u2014and I can understand why; it's a brutal environment there, particularly that which is on our TV screens\u2014that there is farmers farming; there are small businesses growing; there's a currency that's relatively stable; there's an entrepreneurial class; there's commerce. General Abizaid was describing to me what it was like to go to Baghdad markets.There's a lot of work to be done, don't get me wrong, but it is\u2014there are people living relatively normal lives who, I believe\u2014strongly believe that they want to continue that normalcy. And it's up to Prime Minister Maliki to do everything he can to make the situation as secure as possible.Ann [Ann Compton, ABC News].

What is your level of confidence that if you are able to reach a comprehensive deal with the Speaker, that he will be able to bring his members onboard and get it passed?

I'm often reminded when I speak to the Republican leadership that the majority of their caucus's membership come from districts that I lost. All right? And so sometimes, they may not see an incentive in cooperating with me, in part because they're more concerned about challenges from a Tea Party candidate or challenges from the right, and cooperating with me may make them vulnerable. I recognize that.But, goodness, if this past week has done anything, it should just give us some perspective. If there's one thing we should have after this week, it should be a sense of perspective about what's important. And I would like to think that members of their\u2014that caucus would say to themselves: You know what, we disagree with the President on a whole bunch of things. We wish the other guy had won. We're going to fight him on a whole range of issues over the next 4 years. We think his philosophy is all screwed up. But right now what the country needs is for us to compromise, get a deficit reduction deal in place, make sure middle class taxes don't go up, make sure that we're laying the foundations for growth, give certainty to businesses large and small, not put ourselves through some sort of self-inflicted crisis every 6 months, allow ourselves time to focus on things like preventing the tragedy in Newtown from happening again, focus on issues like energy, immigration reform, and all the things that will really make a determination as to whether our country grows over the next 4 years, 10 years, 40 years.And if you just pull back from the immediate political battles, if you kind of peel off the partisan war paint, then we should be able to get something done.And I think the Speaker would like to get that done. I think an environment needs to be created within not just the House Republican Caucus, but also among Senate Republicans that say, the campaign is over and let's see if we can do what's right for the country, at least for the next month. And then, we can reengage in all the other battles that they'll want to fight.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nTrust in Speaker Boehner in the process of reaching a comprehensive deal.\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

And to Chancellor Scholz: Can you outline specific steps that Germany is taking to reduce its energy dependence on Russia? And what do you say to those who suggest that German reliance on Russian gas is limiting Europe's options for how to respond to the crisis in Ukraine?Chancellor Scholz. Thank you very much for raising that question because it gives me the opportunity to address a topic that's important to me. One good news, maybe, within its strategy on fighting manmade climate change, Germany has decided at very short\u2014in a very short period of time to phase out of the use of oil and gas by\u2014very soon. And by 2045, Germany will have a carbon-neutral economy as one of the strongest economies of the world.And with regard to these energies\u2014we often think about heating at home and driving a car, but we're talking about industrial production: producing steel, chemical substances, cement. And changing these industrial processes and reorganizing such systems is what we have planned.So this year, we will continue to take far-reaching decisions that will help us to use more wind energy\u2014offshore wind energy, onshore wind energy\u2014and solar energy; and expand the capacities, expand the grids; and have a strategy for Germany, but also worldwide on the use of hydrogen, which is a central element for us to change our industrial processes that are using oil and gas right now.The industry is willing to be on board. We're doing this together with them, but it will probably be the biggest industrial modernization project in Germany in 100 years, with very good prospects that we will develop new technologies that other partners in the world can use as well, and this will help us fight climate change.And by the way, the energy mix today, we are talking about one-quarter of our energy that is linked to gas. And only part of that gas comes from Russia; a big part comes from Norway or the Netherlands. And of course, it is very important to us that we develop an infrastructure that will give us the opportunity to have all options available and react if needed.So you don't have to be concerned. There are some who should be concerned who see themselves maybe too much as a deliverer of such resources. Because we are focusing on renewable energies, we will go down that path and make sure that this is the profitable future.Mr. Rinke [Andreas Rinke, Reuters].Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)/U.S. Energy Exports/Russia  Q. Mr. President, I would like to ask you a question about LNG. Germany and Europe are much more dependent on Russian gas than other regions of the world, and you promised European allies to help with LNG. But this resource is more expensive; it's not available in the volumes that might be needed to replace Russian gas. And I would like to know from you how you would help Europeans in case of a conflict with Russia. Is this an empty promise, or what can you really do? What can you offer?And, in addition, the U.S. are buying oil from Russia worth billions of dollars. And I would like to know whether these transfers are also part of the sanctions package against Russia.And, Mr. Chancellor\u2014liquefied natural gas. There is a big controversy in Germany about fracking gas. And how far is LNG even a real replacement, or is it also with a view to the climate club you intend to found? Is it really an alternative to Russian pipeline gas?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nLet me respond. First of all, we are looking at opportunities to make up for lost gas\u2014LNG\u2014from Russia. We're underway of trying to see what we can do to do that and dealing with our friends around the world, as well. We think we could make up a significant portion of it that would be lost.But you know, what everybody forgets here is, Russia needs to be able to sell that gas and sell that oil. Russia relies\u2014a significant part of Russia's budget\u2014it's the only thing they really have to export. And if in fact it's cut off, then they're going to be hurt very badly as well. And it's of consequence to them as well. This is not just a one-way street.And so we are looking at what we could do to help compensate for loss of\u2014immediate loss of gas in Europe if it occurs. And that's what we've been working on for some time now. I can confirm that we work closely with the United States of America, and Joe Biden and I are working closely together as well.We are prepared for all kinds of situation. And that's part of what we do when we say we prepare sanctions. That means we need to be able to react at any time, and this is happening.With regard to the use of LNG, I can say that the biggest volume of LNG used across the world is the gas, and that is part of the debate.Concerning a long-term perspective, I already outlined what this is about. We will modernize our economy. And where gas is being used, we will switch to hydrogen. This will be a process that will happen faster than many might imagine today, and that will create a bright future for all of us. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Mr. President, are America's banks in trouble? And does the rescue of Freddie Mae and Fannie Mac make more bailouts inevitable by sending the message that there are some institutions that are too big to fail and that it's okay to take risks?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nFirst, let me talk about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A lot of people in the country probably don't understand how important they are to the mortgage markets. And it's really important for people to have confidence in the mortgage markets and that there be stability in the mortgage markets. And that's why Secretary Paulson announced the plan this weekend, which says that he needs authorities from the Congress to come up with a line of credit for these institutions, if needed, and that he ought to have the authority to invest capital, if needed.And so the purpose was to send a clear signal that, one, we understand how important these institutions are to the mortgage markets, and two, to kind of calm nerves. The truth of the matter is, by laying this out, it is\u2014makes it less likely we'll need to use this kind of authority to begin with, which, by the way, is temporary authority.As you\u2014talked about banks. Now, if you're a commercial bank in America and your deposit\u2014and you have a deposit in a commercial bank in America, your deposit is insured by the Federal Government up to $100,000. And so therefore, when you hear nervousness about your bank, you know, people start talking about how nervous they are about your bank's condition, the depositor must understand that the Federal Government, through the FDIC, stands behind the deposit up to $100,000. And therefore\u2014which leads me to say that if you're a depositor, you're in\u2014you're protected by the Federal Government.I happened to have witnessed a bank run in Midland, Texas, one time. I'll never forget the guy standing in the bank lobby saying, Your deposits are good. We got you insured. You don't have to worry about it if you got less than $100,000 in the bank. The problem was, people didn't hear. And there's a\u2014became a nervousness. My hope is, is that people take a deep breath and realize that their deposits are protected by our Government.So these are two different instances, mortgage markets on the one hand, banking on the other.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAre America's banks in trouble?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

But as I indicated to Ben in the earlier question, you take a look at what we've been able to accomplish in mobilizing the world community against over the last 3 years, and it shows steady, determined, firm progress in isolating the ian regime and sending a clear message that the world believes it would be dangerous for them to have a nuclear weapon.Now, is this an easy issue? No. Anybody who claims it is, is either politicking or doesn't know what they're talking about. But I think not only the world, but the ian regime understands very clearly how determined we are to prevent not only a nuclear , but also a nuclear arms race in the region and a violation of nonproliferation norms that would have implications around the world, including in the Asia-Pacific region, where we have similar problems with North Korea.David Nakamura [Washington Post].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nIs Mitt Romney wrong about Iran having a nuclear weapon if the person is reelected?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

You mentioned that Americans are frustrated. And, in fact, 75 percent of voters say the country is heading in the wrong direction, despite the results of last night. What in the next 2 years do you intend to do differently to change people's opinion of the direction of the country, particularly as you contemplate a run for President in 2024?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNothing, because they're just finding out what we're doing. The more they know about what we're doing, the more support there is.Do you know anybody who wants us to get rid of the change we made on prescription drug prices and raise prices again? Do you know anybody who wants us to walk away from building those roads and bridges and the internet and so on? I don't know any\u2014I think that the problem is, the major pieces of legislation we passed\u2014and some of it bipartisan\u2014takes time to be recognized.For example, you've got over a trillion dollars' worth of infrastructure money, but not that many spades have been put in the ground. It's taking time. For example, I was on the phone congratulating a Californian recently and then someone in\u2014up in Scranton, Pennsylvania\u2014the Congressman who got elected. And he said, Can you help us make sure we're able to have high-speed rail service from Scranton to New York\u2014New York City? I said: Yes, we can. We can.First of all, it will make it a lot easier, take a lot of vehicles off the road. And we have more money in the pot now already out there\u2014we voted for\u2014than the entire money we spent on Amtrak to begin with.And it's the same way\u2014for example, I talked about, through the campaign, that we're going to limit the cost of insulin for seniors to $35 a month instead of $400 a month. Well, it doesn't take effect until next year.So there's a lot of things that are just starting to kick in. And the same way with what we've done in terms of environmental stuff. It takes time to get it moving.So I'm not going to change\u2014as a matter of fact, you know there's some things I wanted to change and add to. For example, we've\u2014had passed the most bipartisan, we passed the most extensive gun legislation\u2014you know, rational gun policy in 30 years. And\u2014but we didn't ban assault weapons. I'm going to ban assault weapons. They're going to try like the devil\u2014so I'm not going to change the direction.I said I ran for three reasons. I'm going to continue to stay where I'm\u2014and I know\u2014I fully understand the legitimate concern that what I'm saying is wrong. Okay?One is that I said we're going to restore the soul of the country, begin to treat each other with decency, honor, and integrity. And it's starting to happen. People are starting\u2014the conversations are becoming more normal, becoming more\u2014more\u2014how can I say it?\u2014decent.Second thing I said was, I want to build a country from the middle out and the bottom up. And that way, everybody does fine. I'm tired of trickle-down. Not a whole lot trickles down when you trickle down to hard-working folks.And the third thing\u2014I know is still very hard\u2014I'm going to do everything in my power to see through that we unite the country. It's hard to sustain yourself as a leading democracy in the world if you can't generate some unity.So I'm not going to change anything in any fundamental way.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat in the next 2 years do you intend to do differently to change people's opinion of the direction of the country, particularly as you contemplate a run for President in 2024?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Well, I wanted to ask you about SCHIP and why you even let that get to a situation where it had to be a veto.

As I said, we weren't dialed in. And I don't know why. But they just ran the bill, and I made it clear we weren't going to accept it. That happens sometimes. In the past, when I said, look, make sure we're a part of the process, and we were. In this case, this bill started heading our way\u2014and I recognize Republicans in the Senate supported it. We made it clear we didn't agree, and they passed it anyway. And so now, hopefully, we'll be in the process. That's why the President has a veto. Sometimes the legislative branch wants to go on without the President, pass pieces of legislation, and the President then can use the veto to make sure he's a part of the process. And that's\u2014as you know, I fully intend to do. I want to make sure\u2014and that's why, when I tell you I'm going to sprint to the finish and finish this job strong, that's one way to ensure that I am relevant; that's one way to sure that I am in the process.

And you're close to having suspects in custody?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI will leave it at that. But this remains a top priority for us. Anybody who attacks Americans, anybody who kills, tragically, four Americans who were serving us in a very dangerous place, we're going to do everything we can to get those who carried out those attacks.With respect to health care, I didn't simply choose to delay this on my own. This was in consultation with businesses all across the country, many of whom are supportive of the Affordable Care Act, but\u2014and who\u2014many of whom, by the way, are already providing health insurance to their employees but were concerned about the operational details of changing their HR operations, if they've got a lot of employees, which could be costly for them, and them suggesting that there may be easier ways to do this.Now, what's true, Ed, is, is that in a normal political environment, it would have been easier for me to simply call up the Speaker and say, you know what, this is a tweak that doesn't go to the essence of the law\u2014it has to do with, for example, are we able to simplify the attestation of employers as to whether they're already providing health insurance or not\u2014it looks like there may be some better ways to do this; let's make a technical change to the law. That would be the normal thing that I would prefer to do.But we're not in a normal atmosphere around here when it comes to, quote, unquote, Obamacare. We did have the executive authority to do so, and we did so. But this doesn't go to the core of implementation. Let me tell you what is the core of implementation that's already taken place. As we speak, right now, for the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, they are benefiting from being able to keep their kid on their plan if their kid is 26 or younger. That's benefiting millions of young people around the country, which is why lack of insurance among young people has actually gone down. That's in large part attributable to the steps that we've taken.You've got millions of people who have received rebates, because part of the Affordable Care Act was to say that if insurance company isn't spending 80 percent of your premium on your health care, you get some money back. And lo and behold, people have been getting their money back. It means that folks who have been bumping up with lifetime limits on their insurance, that it leaves them vulnerable. That doesn't exist.Seniors have been getting discounts on their prescription drugs. That's happening right now. Free preventive care: mammograms, contraception. That's happening right now. I met a young man today on a bill signing I was doing with the student loan bill who came up to me and said thank you\u2014he couldn't have been more than 25, 26 years old\u2014thank you; I have cancer, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, working with the California program, I was able to get health care, and I'm now in remission. And so right now people are already benefiting.Now, what happens on October 1, in 53 days, is for the remaining 15 percent of the population that doesn't have health insurance, they're going to be able to go on a web site or call up a call center and sign up for affordable, quality health insurance at a significantly cheaper rate than what they can get right now on the individual market. And if even with lower premiums they still can't afford it, we're going to be able to provide them with a tax credit to help them buy it. And between October 1, into March, there will be an open enrollment period in which millions of Americans for the first time are going to be able to get affordable health care.Now, I think the really interesting question is, why it is that my friends in the other party have made the idea of preventing these people from getting health care their holy grail, their number-one priority? The one unifying principle in the Republican Party at the moment is making sure that 30 million people don't have health care and, presumably, repealing all those benefits I just mentioned: kids staying on their parent's plan; seniors getting discounts on their prescription drugs; I guess a return to lifetime limits on insurance; people with preexisting conditions continuing to be blocked from being able to get health insurance.That's hard to understand as an agenda that is going to strengthen our middle class. At least, they used to say, well, we're going to replace it with something better. There's not even a pretense now that they're going to replace it with something better.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAre you close to having suspects in custody?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

As I've told you\u2014and you may be aware or you've seen it\u2014we have provided for a proposal that would cut a trillion dollars off the baseline spent from the year before by just agreeing to deal with what was initially offered.And secondly, we're in a situation where the\u2014let me put it this way: If you all were doing your budget at home, and you said, Okay, we have to make some cuts, would you only look at the spending or would you also look at your income\u2014what was coming in the door\u2014to determine what you could afford?And so part of what I've been arguing from the beginning is a need to consider the tax structure as well as\u2014as well as\u2014cutting spending. I'm willing to cut spending, and I proposed cuts in spending of over a trillion dollars.But I believe we have to also look at the tax revenues. The idea that the\u2014my Republican colleagues want to continue the $2 trillion tax cut that had profound negative impacts on the economy from the Trump administration. The fact that they are\u2014we've provided for the number of\u2014we got a lot of input from serious economists and former administration officials in both parties that we need more people who are qualified to be able to look at the tax returns of the thousand billionaires in America\u2014very complicated stuff.It's estimated that if we had the appropriate number of tax personnel, that we would save somewhere between\u2014we would generate somewhere between $200 billion and $400 billion in tax revenue.And there's a lot of other\u2014for example, the idea that we're\u2014in terms of taxes\u2014that they refuse to\u2014for example, we\u2014I was able to balance the budget and pass everything from the global warming bill\u2014anyway, I was able to cut, by $1.7 billion [trillion; White House correction] in the first 2 years, the deficit that we were accumulating.And\u2014because I was able to say, too, that the 55 corporations in America that made forty\u2014$400 billion\u2014or $40 billion\u2014$400 billion\u2014that they\u2014they pay zero in tax. Zero. And so we said, You've got to pay a minimum of 15 percent taxes. What a horrible thing. You're paying more than 15 percent in taxes, every one of you out there.And so guess what? We not only balanced the budget; we were able to reduce the deficit by $1.7 billion [trillion; White House correction]. And so there's a lot of things that they refuse to look at in terms of tax generation as well as what kind of people we're going to increase taxes for.And like I said, we're now down to\u2014we went from somewhere\u2014roughly 740 billionaires to about 1,000 billionaires in America. They're paying an average tax rate of 8 percent. Raise your hand if you want to pay 8 percent only. I think you'd all be ready to do that.So my point is that there's a lot of things that they refuse to entertain, and they just said revenue is off the table. Well, revenue is not off the table. And so that's what I continue\u2014we continue to have a significant disagreement on, on the revenue side.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nConcern about accepting a cap or freezing spending and its impact on the economy.\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

It's being run. A lot of things are happening. You know, it's not easy what he's doing. He's changing certain ways. It's a very hard thing to do. I won't get into it. I'm going to let him sell his ideas. But a lot of people don't disagree with his ideas.But it's a very hard thing to do if you're a great citizen of France. You love your country, but you want to do the way you've been doing it for a long time. But maybe that's not working. And maybe they have to do what he has to do. I think he's going to do a fantastic job. But it's very tough for him. I know how tough it is for him. He's been having a hard time. And nobody would have any easy time. But I do believe he is doing the right thing.Boris is different. It's a different kind of a deal. Boris has to try and do something with Brexit. It's very tough. I deal with the EU. The EU is\u2014that's a very, very strong group of people. They have their ideas, and they're not easy to deal with, I will tell you.We've very close to making a deal, by the way, with the EU. I have to say this. We made a great deal with Japan. And we're very close to maybe making a deal with the EU. Because they don't want tariffs; it's very simple. They don't want to tax cars. Mercedes Benz, BMW, they don't need a 20-percent or a 25-percent tax. But we're very close. I think we're going to make a deal with the EU without having to go that route. I may have to go that route, but maybe not.We're going to have a deal, a really fair deal. But the EU is another one. We've been losing $180 billion a year for many years. That's a lot of money.

Mr. President, the Romanian people, the Romanians have a great expectations with regards to the very good ties, political and economic, between the two states. In a very practical manner, they will ask, when will we have the same regime as the other citizens from the European Union with regards to the visas? Could we have a deadline for this when we could travel freely to the United States?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nFirst of all, your President was very articulate on the subject of visas. One of the benefits of having a good friendship is that he's not afraid of telling me what's on his mind. [] And he made it abundantly clear that visa policy in America must take into account Romanian past and also Romanian future and present. In other words\u2014and I fully understand the frustrations of the Romanian people. I understand it. I understand that a citizen says: Wait a minute. We're contributing soldiers in Iraq, and yet we're not necessarily treated like other nations in the European collective or European Union.And those frustrations are clearly understandable. That's why I went to Congress and tried to get them to modernize the visa law. And all they\u2014although they changed the law, it still creates certain hurdles for nations like Romania. And I assured the President that we will work with him as best as we can to adhere to our law and to, at the same time, understands the contradictions.It's\u2014hopefully, the new law will\u2014and our cooperation\u2014will make it easier for Romanian citizens to come and visit their relatives. And obviously, to the extent that somebody tries to come and not come back is something we all got to guard about. That's\u2014but the idea of somebody coming to visit a relative or a long-lost cousin to say hello and to see what America is like and then come back to Romania is an issue that we just got to be thoughtful about.And so yes, I mean, this is\u2014this subject came up. It is clear there's a level of frustration. I explained our new law is in effect, and we'll work closely with the Romanian Government to meet our law and, at the same time, meet the demands of a strong and good ally.Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Right, you want to go over here? Just a moment. Oh, you got\u2014\u2014 Just a moment. He's not through. The information would like to add to refer to two delicate issues, issues that are visible for the Romanian public. We have also approached\u2014 we have also addressed the visa issue and also the Teo Peter issue. And we hope to find, in time, the decision taken by President Bush was that, in the near future, we will launch the bilateral mechanism that\u2014apart from the European ones. And referring to the other issue, to find as fast as possible a reasonable solution acceptable for the family of Teo Peter.Thank you. He's going to show me this wharf out here.

And do you think that the agreement should be amended to address currency manipulation?Secondly, President Obama, can you comment on the killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansur and on Pakistan's concern about that strike happening on its soil? Can you also comment on whether this signals a new offensive in Afghanistan and whether you're concerned that an even more hardline leader might take his place?For President Quang, are you concerned about the lack of enthusiasm for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the U.S. Congress and what that means for the deal in the end? And how do you respond to China's criticism of the U.S. pursuing what China says is a one-sided, selfish agenda in Asia that risks regional peace?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nSo, first of ll, on TPP, Angel, I hven't been round s long s Sentors Crper or Secretry Kerry, but I've spent enough tie in the Sente to know tht every trde del is pinful, becuse folks re lwys seeing if they cn get n even better del. And especilly when you hve ultiple prties involved, folks re going to be scrutinizing it, they're going to be debting it, nd in n election yer, you cn nticipte tht soe folks re going to try to score politicl points off it.Hving sid tht, I rein confident we're going to get it done. And the reson I' confident is becuse it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country. It's good for Aeric. It's good for the regio It's good for the world.And I know I've sold this to you before, but let e reiterte: This is the fstest growing prt of the world. This represents n enorous rket for the United Sttes. Most countries here lredy sell their stuff to the United Sttes, nd we hve reltively low triffs. In other words, we put reltively low txes on goods tht re coing into the United Sttes. In contrst, triffs re significntly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So del tht gets rid of 18,000 txes on U.S. goods into the lrgest, fstest growing rkets of the world, tht's good del for Aericn businesses nd Aericn workers.Nuber two, one of the biggest coplints bout trde dels historiclly hs been tht it opens up our rkets to countries with lower wges, hrsher lbor prctices, less environentl regultio Well, if you're signing up for the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, you re king coitents tht re enforceble to rise lbor stndrds, to ensure tht workers hve voice, to ttend to environentl probles. And so this gives us the bility to engge with country like Vietn nd work with the on ll those fronts, the precise things tht people, in the pst, hve been concerned bout when it coes to trding with other countries.So I hve not yet seen credible rguent tht once we get TPP in plce we're going to be worse off. We re deonstrbly better off. Aericn workers nd Aericn businesses re better off if we get this del pssed. And I' confident we will get it pssed.Now, the politics of it will be noisy. Tht ws true when I, for exple, inherited the Koren free trde greeent or the Colobin nd Pnnin free trde greeents when I ce into office. But we got the done. And I' confident tht we'll get the done this tie, s well, lthough it will\u2014there will be ups nd downs nd bups long the wy.With respect to currency nipultion, we hve provisions in TPP tht dvnce the trnsprency nd reporting functions tht llow us to onitor whether we think tht currency nipultion is tking plce. One of the debtes tht took plce\u2014nd there hve been soe who rgue tht we should hve enforceble provisions tht if you see currency going down too fr tht we should be ble to ipose triffs on tht country. The proble is, is tht it's very hrd to sort out soeties why currency is going down nd whether it's ctully being nipulted. And frnkly, for us to bind other countries to coitents bout their onetry policy would en we were lso binding our Federl Reserve to the clis of other countries in ters of how it ipleents our onetry policy, nd tht's not soething tht we would do. We would not give up sovereignty with respect to our onetry policy in tht wy. But we hve strengthened nuber of the provisions tht re lredy contined in TPP tht will llow us to put on notice folks who we think re engging in copetitive devlutions.Finlly, on the Tlibn leder, Mr. Mnsur, it hs been confired tht he is ded. And he is n individul who, s hed of the Tlibn, ws specificlly trgeting U.S. personnel nd troops inside of Afghnistn who were there s prt of the ission tht I've set to be ble to intin counterterroris pltfor nd provide ssistnce nd trining to the Afghn ilitry forces there. So this does not represent shift in our pproch. We re not reentering the dy-to-dy cobt opertions tht re currently being conducted by Afghn security forces. Our job is to help Afghnistn secure its own country, not to hve our en nd woen in unifor engge in tht fight for the.On the other hnd, where we hve high-profile leder who hs been consistently prt of opertions nd plns to potentilly hr U.S. personnel nd who hs been resistnt to the kinds of pece tlks nd reconcilition tht ultitely could bring n end to decdes of wr in Afghnistn, then it is y responsibility s Conder in Chief not to stnd by, but to ke sure tht we send cler signl to the Tlibn nd others tht we're going to protect our people. And tht's exctly the essge tht hs been sent. President ung. Let e respond to this question concerning the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, TPP. In our view, TPP is significnt trde nd econoic linkge, contributing to sustining the dynis nd the role s driver for econoic growth in our country, s well s in the Asi-Pcific regio And for Vietn, TPP nd Vietn's prticiption in TPP is one step undertken by the Vietnese Governent in our process of extensive interntionl integrtio President Ob. Mr. President, sorry to interrupt. We're not getting trnsltio Testing one, two, three. President Ob. For you? Cn you her, Mr. President? President Ob. Oky. Testing one, two, three. President Ob. It's just, I' sure tht he ws sying soething very wise nd iportnt, nd we wnted to ke sure tht we ll herd it. President ung. So I would like to dd tht Vietn, together with other TPP countries, hve been king efforts to nrrow differences, to proote coopertion in the spirit of utul understnding nd utul respect. And we will try to reduce differences in spirit of constructiveness nd understnding nd pying ttention to one nother's legitite interests. And the finliztion of TPP is lso the successful outcoes of ll 12 ebers of the TPP, rther thn ny individul effort. And we re prepred to rtify TPP, nd we stnd redy to ipleent ll the coitents under TPP.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow do you respond to China's criticism of the U.S. pursuing what China says is a one-sided, selfish agenda in Asia that risks regional peace?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. What is your response to critics who say the $400 million in cash that you sent to Iran was a ransom payment? Was it really simply a pure coincidence that a sum that was\u2014a payment that was held up for almost four decades was suddenly sent at the exact same time that the American prisoners were released? And can you assure the American people that none of that money went to support terrorism?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nOkay. The\u2014it's been interesting to watch this story surface. Some of you may recall, we announced these payments in January, many months ago. There wasn't a secret. Right? We announced them to all of you. Josh did a briefing on them. This wasn't some nefarious deal. And at the time, we explained that Iran had pressed a claim before an international tribunal about them recovering money of theirs that we had frozen; that, as a consequence of its working its way through the international tribunal, it was the assessment of our lawyers that we were now at a point where there was significant litigation risk and we could end up costing ourselves billions of dollars. It was their advice and suggestion that we settle. And that's what these payments represent. And it wasn't a secret. We were completely open with everybody about it. And it's interesting to me how suddenly this became a story again. That's point number one.Point number two: We do not pay ransom for hostages. We've got a number of Americans being held all around the world. And I meet with their families, and it is heartbreaking. And we have stood up an entire section of interagency experts who devote all their time to working with these families to get these Americans out.But those families know that we have a policy that we don't pay ransom. And the notion that we would somehow start now in this high-profile way and announce it to the world\u2014even as we're looking into the faces of other hostage families\u2014families whose loved ones are being held hostage and say to them that we don't pay ransom\u2014defies logic. So that's point number two. We do not pay ransom. We didn't here. And we don't\u2014we won't in the future, precisely because if we did, then we would start encouraging Americans to be targeted, much in the same way that some countries that do pay ransom end up having a lot more of their citizens being taken by various groups.Point number three is that the timing of this was, in fact, dictated by the fact that as a consequence of us negotiating around the nuclear deal, we actually had diplomatic negotiations and conversations with Iran for the first time in several decades. So the issue is not so much that it was a coincidence as it is that we were able to have a direct discussion.John Kerry could meet with the Foreign Minister, which meant that our ability to clear accounts on a number of different issues at the same time converged. And it was important for us to take advantage of that opportunity both to deal with this litigation risk that had been raised\u2014it was important for us to make sure that we finished the job on the Iran nuclear deal\u2014and since we were in a conversation with them, it was important for us to be able to push them hard in getting these Americans out.And let me make a final point on this. It's now been well over a year since the agreement with Iran to stop its nuclear program was signed. And by all accounts, it has worked exactly the way we said it was going to work. You will recall that there were all these horror stories about how Iran was going to cheat and this wasn't going to work and Iran was going to get $150 billion to finance terrorism and all these kinds of scenarios, and none of them have come to pass. And it's not just the assessment of our intelligence community, it's the assessment of the Israeli military and intelligence community\u2014the country that was most opposed to this deal\u2014that acknowledges this has been a game changer and that Iran has abided by the deal and that they no longer have the sort of short-term breakout capacity that would allow them to develop nuclear weapons.So what I'm interested in is, if there's some news to be made, why not have some of these folks who were predicting disaster say, you know what, this thing actually worked? [] Now, that would be a shock. [] That would be impressive, if some of these folks who had said the sky is falling suddenly said, you know what, we were wrong, and we are glad that Iran no longer has the capacity to break out in short term and develop a nuclear weapon. But of course, that wasn't going to happen.Instead, what we have is the manufacturing of outrage in a story that we disclosed in January. And the only bit of news that is relevant on this is the fact that we paid cash, which brings me to my last point. The reason that we had to give them cash is precisely because we are so strict in maintaining sanctions and we do not have a banking relationship with Iran that we couldn't send them a check and we could not wire the money.And it is not at all clear to me why it is that cash, as opposed to a check or a wire transfer, has made this into a news story. Maybe because it kind of feels like some spy novel or some crime novel because cash was exchanged. The reason cash was exchanged is because we don't have a banking relationship with Iran, which is precisely part of the pressure that we were able to apply to them so that they would ship a whole bunch of nuclear material out and close down a bunch of facilities that, as I remember, 2 years ago, 3 years ago, 5 years ago, was people's top fear and priority, that we make sure Iran doesn't have breakout nuclear capacity. They don't. This worked.Josh Lederman [Associated Press].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nCan the President assure the American people that none of the money went to support terrorism?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

It's in the meantime, sir, that I'm curious about. As you just said, raising the debt ceiling is apparently fairly routine, but it's brought us to the point of economic Armageddon, as you said. If you can get past this one, how can you get any agreement with Congress on those big issues you talked about?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI am going to keep on working, and I'm going to keep on trying. And what I'm going to do is to hope that, in part, this debate has focused the American people's attention a little bit more and will subject Congress to scrutiny. And I think increasingly the American people are going to say to themselves, you know what, if a party or a politician is constantly taking the position my way or the high way, constantly being locked into ideologically rigid positions, that we're going to remember at the polls.It's kind of cumulative. The American people aren't paying attention to the details of every aspect of this negotiation, but I think what the American people are paying attention to is who seems to be trying to get something done, and who seems to be just posturing and trying to score political points. And I think it's going to be in the interests of everybody who wants to continue to serve in this town to make sure that they are on the right side of that impression.And that's, by the way, what I said in the meeting 2 days ago. I was very blunt. I said the American people do not want to see a bunch of posturing; they don't want to hear a bunch of sound bites. What they want is for us to solve problems, and we all have to remember that. That's why we were sent here.Last question.

What is he recommending to you in terms of dealing with the latest strikes on Saudi Arabia and the response?And then, secondly, you announced new sanctions on Iran. Secretary Mnuchin said that this affects the last available funds for that regime. Have we now exhausted sanctions in regards to Iran?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell these are the strongest sanctions ever put on a country. We are at a level of sanction that is far greater than ever before with respect to Iran. Today we did Central Bank as you know. And we'll see. We'll see.They're having a lot of problems not only with us; they're having problems within their own country. And I think they have a lot of self-made problems.We are by far the strongest military in the world. Going into Iran would be a very easy decision. As I said before it'd be very easy. The easiest thing. Most people thought I would go in within 2 seconds but plenty of time. Plenty of time.In the meantime they have a lot of problems within Iran. Iran could be a great country could be a rich country. But they are choosing to go a different way. There'll be a point at which they'll be very sorry for that choice. But I think I'm showing great restraint. A lot of people respect it; some people don't. Some people say Oh you should go in immediately. And other people are so thrilled at what I'm doing. And I don't do it for anybody; I do it for what's good for the United States what's good for our allies. And it's working out really very well.As far as Robert is concerned he's\u2014Robert maybe you could stand up? Robert O'Brien is done a fantastic job for us with hostage negotiations. I think we can say that there has never been anybody that has done better than you and I as a combination. We've brought many people home and we brought them home quickly. Speed is a very important thing I find with hostages. It's really something.I had dinner the other night with the Warmbier family an incredible family\u2014the whole family and some of Otto's friends in addition to the family. We had 25 people over on Saturday night. And we did that dinner in Otto\u2014really in Otto's honor. And it was a beautiful thing. It was a beautiful thing.The First Lady and I it was very\u2014you know it was very touching and really very beautiful. We talked about Otto. And I will tell you that people should have moved faster. And Robert and I were talking about that. Should have moved faster. He was there for a long time.You've got to move fast. With hostages you have to move fast. All of a sudden it gets very hard for the other side to do anything. And sometimes it's just too late. In the case of Otto it was very late. We got him home but he was in horrible horrible condition. What happened to him was actually incredible and just horrible.But you have to move fast. Robert and I have been really successful. And the reason I know him so well\u2014I actually work hard on hostages I think he would say. I think most Presidents wouldn't do that but I do. These are great\u2014I guess in almost all cases\u2014American lives. And we help other people also. We've also helped other countries with their hostage situation where we have some strength that they don't.But these are great people. And we get them home. We got them home from North Korea as you know. And we got them home from a lot of different locations. Egypt\u2014we got them home. We got them home from many different locations. Turkey. President Erdogan was very good. And we got a hostage home who\u2014our great pastor who everyone in this room knows and loves.But we've had tremendous success. And what's surprised me I didn't know too many people knew Robert. And when it came time to pick somebody for the position\u2014it's a very critical time\u2014I had so many people\u2014I shouldn't say this in front of Robert he'll be embarrassed but I had so many people that called me and they recommended Robert O'Brien. So I think he's going to do a great job.And he was here\u2014I can tell you this\u2014he started about 12 minutes after he was chosen. He sat in with us. And he's very much involved now on what we're doing.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHave we now exhausted sanctions in regards to Iran?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Mr. President, like that cease-fire, you've called for diplomatic solutions not only in Israel and Gaza, but also in Ukraine, in Iraq, to very little effect so far. Has the United States of America lost its influence in the world? Have you lost yours?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes. Look, this is a common theme that folks bring up. Apparently, people have forgotten that America, as the most powerful country on Earth, still does not control everything around the world. And so our diplomatic efforts often take time. They often will see progress and then a step backwards. That's been true in the Middle East. That's been true in Europe. That's been true in Asia. That's the nature of world affairs. It's not neat, and it's not smooth.But if you look at, for example, Ukraine, we have made progress in delivering on what we said we would do. We can't control how Mr. Putin thinks. But what we can do is say to Mr. Putin, if you continue on the path of arming separatists with heavy armaments that, the evidence suggests, may have resulted in 300 innocent people on a jet dying, and that violates international law and undermines the integrity\u2014territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, then you're going to face consequences that will hurt your country.And there was a lot of skepticism about our ability to coordinate with Europeans for a strong series of sanctions. And each time, we have done what we said we would do, including this week, when we put in place sanctions that have an impact on key sectors of the Russian economy: their energy, their defense, and their financial systems.It hasn't resolved the problem yet. I spoke to Mr. Putin this morning, and I indicated to him, just as we will do what we say we do in terms of sanctions, we'll also do what we say we do in terms of wanting to resolve this issue diplomatically if he takes a different position. If he respects and honors the right of Ukrainians to determine their own destiny, then it's possible to make sure that Russian interests are addressed that are legitimate and that Ukrainians are able to make their own decisions and we can resolve this conflict and end some of the bloodshed.But the point is, though, Bill, that if you look at the 20th century and the early part of this century, there are a lot of conflicts that America doesn't resolve. That's always been true. That doesn't mean we stop trying. And it's not a measure of American influence on any given day or at any given moment that there are conflicts around the world that are difficult. The conflict in Northern Ireland raged for a very, very long time until finally something broke, where the parties decided that it wasn't worth killing each other.The Palestinian-Israeli conflicts has been going on even longer than you've been reporting. [] And I don't think at any point was there a suggestion somehow that America didn't have influence just because we weren't able to finalize an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. You will recall that situations like Kosovo and Bosnia raged on for quite some time, and there was a lot more death and bloodshed than there has been so far in the Ukrainian situation before it ultimately did get resolved.And so I recognize, with so many different issues popping up around the world, sometimes, it may seem as if this is an aberration or it's unusual. But the truth of the matter is, is that this is a big world out there and that as indispensable as we are to try to lead it, there's still going to be tragedies out there and there are going to be conflicts. And our job is to just make sure that we continue to project what's right, what's just, and that we're building coalitions of like-minded countries and partners in order to advance not only our core security interests, but also the interests of the world as a whole.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHas the United States of America lost its influence in the world?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Are you worried that you might have regrets?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nNo, I made a decision. I stand by it. I'm now worried that the rest of the world needs to move as expeditiously, quickly. Therefore, we're\u2014as I've told you in this little address here, we've got $100 million to help move people into Darfur. And nor am I regretful of the fact that we put serious sanctions on leaders in Sudan and companies owned by certain actors in Sudan. It was the right thing to do.I am trying to get other people to join. As you know, getting a universal sanction regime can be difficult. People sometimes have got different interests, different commercial interests. Our position is, is that human suffering ought to be\u2014preempt commercial interests. And so I'm comfortable with the decision I made. I'm not comfortable with to how quickly the response has been.And nevertheless, there is a\u2014we'll continue dealing with the issue. Every stop I made, I've talked about Darfur. And the President talked about it too. I've talked so long you probably forgot her question to you. [] I still remember, President. Certainly, we discussed Darfur, as we discussed other problem areas, especially on our continent. And I do want to agree with the President; problems are there. But I think the best approach is, indeed, to help Africans develop their capacity to deal with these problems. And more importantly, as the President said, we probably also have to invest our time and even resources in the monitoring and also preventing problems coming up, as they keep coming up in different places.But it is important to understand that, indeed, today we'll have Darfur; maybe tomorrow there will be another problem area, God forbid. But it's important that these problems are not to be seen as if they have to be resolved, attended to, by the United States. They must be attended to by the international community. They must also be attended to by people, if it is in Africa, by Africans. Primarily, they must develop this capacity. And they should be supported to develop this capacity so that we can prevent and we are prepared to prevent. Then you should be able to cope with these challenges, resolving the problems.So I think the approach taken by President Bush were realistic, in the sense that you also do not want to see every problem, United States being called upon to be the answer of that problem. And of course, we\u2014the backlash, also, in the sense that, at the same time, they also start blaming the United States, that they are rushing everywhere solving problems and, of course, reading through that to mean they have other interests and so on and so forth.So I think that will lead the way of helping the people to solve their own problems, but of course, with the support of the United States with its huge capabilities in different areas. And walking together with the rest of the international community is perhaps more important than just blaming the United States, saying, Why didn't you go in and solve the problem? The problems and the solutions to those problems should not be taken away from the responsibilities of their action, should not be taken away from places where they're taking place and the people in those places.I think that is the best way I could\u2014 but we did talk about that. And we did talk about our own contribution and to how that can be enhanced. And the President is willing to support us\u2014support has always been coming\u2014so that we continue to move forward.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAre you worried that you might have regrets?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Very tough to get things past Democrats, where they don't want to see this happen. And they probably, certainly, didn't want to see it happen at this point.But it's a big package. It's a great package. And I think the most exciting part of the package isn't necessarily the billions of dollars; it's going to be what we do with the pharmaceutical industry. We're going to get them back into Puerto Rico. They liked being there, but they changed the tax situation; they ripped it out.

Francis Elliott, the Times. Prime Minister, I wonder whether you agree with the President of the United States that immigration has damaged the cultural fabric of Europe. And, President, perhaps you could elaborate on that remark. What do you mean by that?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYou want me to go?. Do you want to go first? I think it's been very bad for Europe. I think Europe is a place I know very well, and I think that what has happened is very tough. It's a very tough situation. I mean, you see the same terror attacks that I do. We see them a lot. We just left some incredible young men\u2014men and women\u2014at Sandhurst. And they were showing us cells, and they were showing us things that, frankly, 20 years ago nobody even thought about. Probably a lot more recently than that, nobody even thought about.I just think it's changing the culture. I think it's a very negative thing for Europe. I think it's very negative. I think having Germany\u2014and I have a great relationship with Angela Merkel. Great relationship with Germany. But I think that's very much hurt Germany. I think it's very much hurt other parts of Europe.And I know it's politically\u2014not necessarily\u2014correct to say that. But I'll say it, and I'll say it loud. And I think they better watch themselves because you are changing culture. You are changing a lot of things. You're changing security. You're changing\u2014look at what's happening. I mean, you take a look. I mean, look at what's happening to different countries that never had difficulty, never had problems.It's a very sad situation. It's very unfortunate. But I do not think it's good for Europe, and I don't think it's good for our country. We're, as you know, far superior to anything that's happened before, but we have very bad immigration laws, and we're\u2014I mean, we're doing incredibly well considering the fact that we virtually don't have immigration laws. We have laws that are so bad, I don't even call them laws. I call them\u2014it's just like, you just walk across the border. You walk across the border\u2014you put one foot on the land and now you're tied up in a lawsuit for 5 years. It's the craziest thing anyone has ever seen.So I would just make that recommendation to Europe. I've made it very loud and clear. I made it yesterday in\u201429 countries total. And that's the way I feel.. The U.K. has a proud history of welcoming people who are fleeing persecution to our country. We have a proud history of welcoming people who want to come to our country to contribute to our economy and contribute to our society. And over the years, overall, immigration has been good for the U.K. It's brought people with different backgrounds, different outlooks here to the U.K. and has\u2014and we've seen them contributing to our society and to our economy.Of course, what is important is that we have control of our borders. What is important is that we have a set of rules that enables us to determine who comes into our country. And of course, that is what, as a government, we have been doing for a number of years and will be able to continue to do in the future.Mr. President. /North Atlantic Treaty Organization/Russia-U.S. Relations/Poisoning of Former Russian Intelligence Operative Sergei Viktorovich Skripal in Salisbury, United Kingdom\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nPresident's clarification on what he meant by his remark about immigration damaging the cultural fabric of Europe.\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Michael Fischer, DPA. Mr. President, one question to you: The U.S., over the last few years, have exported heavy weapons to Ukraine, and Germany excludes that\u2014has only delivered 5,000 helmets to Ukraine. Don't you think that NATO should act unanimously in this respect and Germany, as the strongest European NATO partner, should also deliver heavy weapons to Ukraine? And Ukraine has asked Germany to do so.And on Nord Stream 2, I would also like to ask: Don't you think, with regard to the threat posed by Russia, Germany should already rethink its position on Nord Stream 2?And the third question, if I may: Over the last few days and weeks, there has been severe criticism from the U.S. media and from Congress as well vis-\u00e0-vis Germany about the reliability of Germany as an ally. This has been called into question. Do you understand this criticism? Is Germany a reliable partner, from your point of view?And, Mr. Chancellor, also a question to you: Nord Stream 2\u2014you said all options are on the table. You're not mentioning Nord Stream 2 by name. Don't you think if you were to spell this out, you could win back trust as a strong ally here for the U.S.?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThere's no need to win back trust. He has the complete trust of the United States. Germany is our\u2014one of our most important allies in the world. There is no doubt about Germany's partnership with the United States. None.With regard to helping Ukraine, one of the largest contributors financially to Ukraine has been Germany. Germany has been in the forefront of making sure\u2014providing economic assistance.You also asked the question\u2014you asked so many, I can't remember them all. But in terms of the U.S. media saying Germany is not reliable, Germany is completely reliable\u2014completely, totally, thoroughly reliable. I have no doubt about Germany at all. We are united. And the transatlantic partnership between Germany and the U.S. is one of the permanent pillars of German policy, and it will be relevant in the future as well\u2014just as relevant. And this will be one of our top priorities always.On behalf of NATO, we are the country in continental Europe that is doing\u2014making the largest contribution: financial means and also military power. And we are the country that contributes a great share\u2014we're not fully\u2014we don't fully agree with you as who pays the biggest part of financial support to Ukraine. And so, since 2014, about 2 billion U.S. dollars direct bilateral support and, within the EU, an additional 3.8 billion that is made available. So a substantial financial means to stabilize the Ukrainian economy, and we are willing to continue with that sort of contribution.So this is the very strong and unbreakable friendship between our two countries. Part of this is that with regard to the difficult situation at the Ukrainian border due to the Russian troops, we have made it very clear we will unanimously act in terms of sanctions.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\n.

I thought\u2014and I've told people\u2014I didn't want to build up people's hopes too much. I told people I thought that this would be a successful meeting if we got along, we developed a relationship, and we could have maybe gotten to this point in 3 or 4 months from now. But it really happened very quickly. A lot of that was because of the foundation that was, you know, put down before we met. A lot of things happened very fast. We didn't have\u2014as an example, bringing back the remains. That was not one of the things that was on our agenda today. I brought that up at the very end because so many people have talked to me about it. And I brought it up at the very end. And he was really very gracious. Instead of saying, Well, let's talk about it the next time. He said: It makes sense. We will do it.And he knew\u2014you know, they know where many of those incredible people are. Where they're buried along roads, along highways, along paths, usually, because our soldiers were moving back and forth, and they had to move rapidly. It's very sad. But he knew.

She said that your refusal to get testing up and running; your\u2014I'm paraphrasing\u2014your flip-flopping on social distancing and masks; and your delusional belief that you know better than the experts\u2014all of that, in her words, are reason that one American dies of COVID-19 every minute. What do you think of that?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI think that's probably one of the reasons she was a terrible candidate and was forced to leave the race because she got her facts wrong. You know she's very bad on facts. She is very weak on facts.And just so you understand: We've done more testing than any country in the world by far. That includes India which has 1.5 billion people. That includes China. That includes every country in the world. We've done more testing. We have better testing than any country in the world. They call; they want to know: Where do we get it? How do we get it? We have better testing than any country in the world.When you do as much testing as us however as you understand you develop more cases. If you tested instead of 65 million people which is what we've done\u2014when you test that many people\u2014you're going to find cases that normally you wouldn't see.If you go to Mexico and you go to other countries you'll see they do almost no testing. They test if somebody is not feeling well. They test if somebody is symptomatic. They test very little. They test very little.We've done more testing than anybody in the world. We've done the best job of any country in the world and that includes from making ventilators that nobody else could have done. We are the ventilator king of the world. We're supplying the whole world now in a few short months with ventilators that are very hard to produce very expensive very complex very delicate very very important. We've done a great job.And then on top of that when you look at the numbers\u2014how we were impacted less than these other countries. And now you look at the explosion of countries that you would have said did such a good job and some of them had advantages over us for obvious reasons having to do with the pandemic. But when you look at the job that we've done compared to others we've done a great job.And she\u2014I read today that she's very short on facts. She\u2014I think she's going to be a big failure. And I think\u2014I look forward to the debate between her and Mike Pence because I think he'll do even better against her than he did about\u2014against Senator Kaine which was a total wipeout.

And do you think that the agreement should be amended to address currency manipulation?Secondly, President Obama, can you comment on the killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansur and on Pakistan's concern about that strike happening on its soil? Can you also comment on whether this signals a new offensive in Afghanistan and whether you're concerned that an even more hardline leader might take his place?For President Quang, are you concerned about the lack of enthusiasm for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the U.S. Congress and what that means for the deal in the end?

And especilly when you hve ultiple prties involved, folks re going to be scrutinizing it, they're going to be debting it, nd in n election yer, you cn nticipte tht soe folks re going to try to score politicl points off it.Hving sid tht, I rein confident we're going to get it done. And the reson I' confident is becuse it's the right thing to do. It's good for the country. It's good for Aeric. It's good for the regio It's good for the world.And I know I've sold this to you before, but let e reiterte: This is the fstest growing prt of the world. This represents n enorous rket for the United Sttes. Most countries here lredy sell their stuff to the United Sttes, nd we hve reltively low triffs. In other words, we put reltively low txes on goods tht re coing into the United Sttes. In contrst, triffs re significntly higher for U.S. goods being sold here. So del tht gets rid of 18,000 txes on U.S. goods into the lrgest, fstest growing rkets of the world, tht's good del for Aericn businesses nd Aericn workers.Nuber two, one of the biggest coplints bout trde dels historiclly hs been tht it opens up our rkets to countries with lower wges, hrsher lbor prctices, less environentl regultio Well, if you're signing up for the Trns-Pcific Prtnership, you re king coitents tht re enforceble to rise lbor stndrds, to ensure tht workers hve voice, to ttend to environentl probles. And so this gives us the bility to engge with country like Vietn nd work with the on ll those fronts, the precise things tht people, in the pst, hve been concerned bout when it coes to trding with other countries.So I hve not yet seen credible rguent tht once we get TPP in plce we're going to be worse off. We re deonstrbly better off. Aericn workers nd Aericn businesses re better off if we get this del pssed. And I' confident we will get it pssed.Now, the politics of it will be noisy. Tht ws true when I, for exple, inherited the Koren free trde greeent or the Colobin nd Pnnin free trde greeents when I ce into office. But we got the done. And I' confident tht we'll get the done this tie, s well, lthough it will\u2014there will be ups nd downs nd bups long the wy.With respect to currency nipultion, we hve provisions in TPP tht dvnce the trnsprency nd reporting functions tht llow us to onitor whether we think tht currency nipultion is tking plce. One of the debtes tht took plce\u2014nd there hve been soe who rgue tht we should hve enforceble provisions tht if you see currency going down too fr tht we should be ble to ipose triffs on tht country. The proble is, is tht it's very hrd to sort out soeties why currency is going down nd whether it's ctully being nipulted. And frnkly, for us to bind other countries to coitents bout their onetry policy would en we were lso binding our Federl Reserve to the clis of other countries in ters of how it ipleents our onetry policy, nd tht's not soething tht we would do. We would not give up sovereignty with respect to our onetry policy in tht wy. But we hve strengthened nuber of the provisions tht re lredy contined in TPP tht will llow us to put on notice folks who we think re engging in copetitive devlutions.Finlly, on the Tlibn leder, Mr. Mnsur, it hs been confired tht he is ded. And he is n individul who, s hed of the Tlibn, ws specificlly trgeting U.S. personnel nd troops inside of Afghnistn who were there s prt of the ission tht I've set to be ble to intin counterterroris pltfor nd provide ssistnce nd trining to the Afghn ilitry forces there. So this does not represent shift in our pproch. We re not reentering the dy-to-dy cobt opertions tht re currently being conducted by Afghn security forces.

Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister, neither of you has shown much doubt about your Iraq policies. Do you acknowledge that your approach has failed, as Baker-Hamilton suggests? And are you willing to engage directly with Syria and Iran and pull out most combat forces by early 2008, unless there's unexpected circumstances?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThe thing I liked about the Baker-Hamilton report is it discussed the way forward in Iraq. And I believe we need a new approach. And that's why I've tasked the Pentagon to analyze the way forward. That's why Prime Minister Blair is here to talk about the way forward, so we can achieve the objective, which is an Iraq which can govern itself, sustain itself, and defend itself and be an ally in the war on terror.And the Baker-Hamilton report did some very interesting things. First, it shows that Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an\u2014to come up with a strategy to achieve an objective, something the American people don't think is possible to happen. In other words, they've seen elections, and they saw all the bitterness and finger-pointing and name-calling and wonder whether or not we can work together on this important cause. And I believe we can, and the Baker-Hamilton commission showed it's possible for people of good will to sit down at the table and design a way forward.And so that's why I'm sitting down with the Members of Congress, to say to both Republicans and Democrats, This is an important cause. It's important for our security. It's important to help lay the foundations for peace, and I want to hear your ideas. And I thought the report did a good job of showing what is possible. The Congress isn't going to accept every recommendation in the report, and neither will the administration, but there's a lot of very important things in the report that we ought to seriously consider.And as the Prime Minister talked about, there's three aspects to the report. One is, how do we empower the Maliki Government so that the Maliki Government\u2014the elected Government of the Iraqis\u2014can help with the economy, can help secure peace, can do hard work necessary to achieve stability and to achieve the objective?It talked about the regional\u2014the countries in the region and the responsibilities of the region to help this Iraqi Government. And the idea of having an international group is an interesting idea. We've already got the compact, and I think the Baker-Hamilton report suggests that we broaden the Compact beyond just economic measures.But one thing is for certain: When people\u2014if people come to the table to discuss Iraq, they need to come understanding their responsibilities to not fund terrorists, to help this young democracy survive, to help with the economics of the country. And if people are not committed, if Syria and Iran is not committed to that concept, then they shouldn't bother to show up.Thirdly, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is an\u2014is important to have\u2014is important to be solved. I'm committed to a two-state solution. I believe it is in Israel's interest and the Palestinian people's interest to have two states living side by side for peace. And the Prime Minister shares that goal, and he is willing to take time to go over and help remove obstacles toward achieving that goal.And there are two notable obstacles. One is the prisoner, and secondly, is for there to be a unity government that recognizes the principles of the Quartet, with which Israel can negotiate. And we want to help.And so I view this as a very important way forward, with important concepts. And the American people expect us to come up with a new strategy to achieve the objective which I've been talking about and which is laid out in the Baker-Hamilton report. Look, I think the analysis of the situation is not really in dispute. The question is, how do we find the right way forward? And what we've got at the moment is something that is at one level very simple to describe but at another level very profound and difficult to deal with, and that is that the outside extremists are linking up with internal extremists, basically to create the circumstances of sectarianism, where it's very, very difficult then for democracy and ordinary institutions to function.And I think the Baker-Hamilton report allows us to\u2014as the situation has evolved in Iraq\u2014to evolve our strategy in order to meet it in the ways that I've just described. But I think we've got to be very, very clear about this: It will require everybody to face up to their responsibilities\u2014us, of course, because we are principal actors in this, but also the Iraqi Government. They've got to be prepared to make the moves necessary\u2014full governance, full capability, reconciliation, and full help and security\u2014and we will be there to support them.But then there's responsibilities, as the President was saying a moment or two ago, on the region and the neighbors. And let me come directly to the Iran and Syria point. The issue for me is not a question of being unwilling to sit down with people or not, but the basis upon which we discuss Iraq has got to be clear, and it's got to be a basis where we are all standing up for the right principles, which are now endorsed in the United Nations resolutions, in respect of Iraq. In other words, you support the democratic elected Government; you do not support sectarians; and you do not support, arm, or finance terrorists.Now, the very reason we have problems in parts of Iraq\u2014and we know this very well down in the south of Iraq\u2014is that Iran, for example, has been doing that. It's been basically arming, financing, supporting terrorism. So we've got to be clear the basis upon which we take this forward. And as I say, it's got to be on the basis of people accepting their responsibilities.And finally, in relation to what the President was just saying a moment or two ago on Israel and Palestine, I mean, I think that one thing that is very clear is that the old Middle East had within it the origins of all the problems we see. I mean, this terrorist problem that we faced in the last few years, it didn't originate, I'm afraid, a few years ago. It's been building up over decades. It's come out of a series of states of oppression, of warped ideology based on a perverted view of the faith of Islam. This has been building up for a long period of time, and it has basically come out of the Middle East.Now my view in the end is that you go back to the origins of this and say, well, how do we resolve it? And the only way we resolve it is by having the right vision and then the practical measures to achieve it.Now I think the vision is absolutely correct. What we've got to do now\u2014and this is exactly why the President is talking about the way forward\u2014is that we've got to get the right way forward\u2014this is where Baker-Hamilton helped\u2014in order that we have the practical policy that bolsters and gives effect to the vision, because the vision is the right vision. You leave a Middle East in which the Israel-Palestine issue is not solved, in which there's no moves towards democracy, in which Iraq goes back in its old state, in which the Iranian people have no chance to express themselves, maybe not in the months or 1 year, 2 years, but you'll have the same problem. You know, the reason we are faced with this issue is because in the end, everything that happened in that region erupted, in fact, on the streets of New York. But it\u2014the origins of this went way, way back before that.And so it is\u2014there's a tendency, I think, sometimes, to see this as a battle between the idealists on the one hand and the realists on the other. In my view, the only modern form of realism is one that has ideals at the center of it.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAre you willing to pull out most combat forces by early 2008, unless there's unexpected circumstances?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Many, many years. It was time to stop.As a private person, I used to talk about it. It's one of the reasons I'm President. And we're in a great position. Our country is doing well. Our unemployment numbers are the lowest they've been in over 50 years. Our unemployment numbers for African American\u2014African American, Asian, for Hispanic are the best they've ever been. Historic numbers.We're in a very strong position. Our consumers are strong. Walmart just announced numbers that were, I mean, mindboggling numbers.

Question of both Presidents: Referring to what has been raised a moment ago, this European initiative\u2014European reassurance initiative, doesn't do away with the division into old and the new members of the alliance. It doesn't mean that the deployment of ground troops of the United States, and Poland and other countries like the Baltic States counted on this very much. So what kind of American troops can we expect in Poland, specifically, within the next months or years? Is it going to be some components of the ground troops? And if so, when are they going to come?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, the\u2014first of all, when you discuss old and new NATO members, I recall my first NATO meeting back in 2009, and I made very clear, at that first meeting, my belief that there's no such thing as new members of NATO and old members of NATO, there are just members of NATO. And because that was my strong view then and continues to be my strong view now, I immediately pushed to make sure that we were putting in place contingency plans for every NATO member. And those contingency plans have been steadily developed over the last several years.And part of what I think your President just indicated is very important is that our contingency plans are not just pieces of paper on a shelf, but we have the capacity to operationalize them. That means that there has to be resources pre-positioned, there has to be training, there have to be joint exercises. We have been conducting those, but there's no doubt that what has happened in Ukraine adds a sense of urgency when we meet in Wales in the next NATO summit.And part of what I discussed with Secretary General of NATO Rasmussen and now with the new Secretary General Stoltenberg is the need to make sure that the collective defense effort is robust, it is ready, it is properly equipped.That does mean that every NATO member has to do its fair share. Obviously, we all have different capacities. The United States is going to have different capacities than Poland; Poland is going to have a different capacity than Latvia. But everyone has the capacity to do their fair share, to do a proportional amount to make sure that we have the resources, the planning, the integration, the training in order to be effective.Some of that has to do with where our personnel is positioned. And obviously, as I indicated before, my administration has put U.S. soldiers on Polish soil for the first time. This new initiative that I'm putting forward gives us the option, the capacity, to add to those rotations.But I think it's important to recognize that the effectiveness of our defenses against any threat is not just going to be dependent on how many troops we have in any particular country; it has to do with how we are working collectively together to make sure that when any NATO member is threatened, all of us can respond rapidly, whether it's through air, sea, or land.And that's going to require some flexibility. It's going to require some additional planning. It's going to require some joint capabilities that right now we don't have. Frankly, NATO is very reliant on U.S. capabilities, but has not always invested in some joint capabilities that would be important as well. And it's going to require every NATO member to step up. We have seen a decline steadily in European defense spending generally. There are exceptions like Poland, like Estonia, but for the most part, we have seen a steady decline. That has to change.The United States is proud to bear its share of the defense of the transatlantic alliance. It is the cornerstone of our security. But we can't do it alone. And we're going to need to make sure that everybody who is a member of NATO has full membership. They expect full membership when it comes to their defense; then that means that they've also got to make a contribution that is commensurate with full membership. President Komorowski. For Poland, what is really fundamental is to make sure that nobody from outside of NATO claims the right to determine what NATO member states may do and what they may not do. And it also concerns the question of the presence of NATO troops and NATO infrastructure in the Polish territory.What is most important for us is to make sure that there are no second-category member states of NATO, that there are no countries about whom an external country\u2014a third country like Russia\u2014can say whether or not American or other allied troops can be deployed to these countries. That is why the decision of the United States of America to deploy American troops to Poland is really very important for us, both as an element of deterrence, but also as a reconfirmation that we do not really accept any limitations concerning the deployment of NATO troops to Poland imposed for some time or suggested for some time by a country that is not member of NATO.Another thing is the inadequacy of response to the existing situation. The Ukrainian crisis, the Russian behavior about Crimea, for example, forced the necessary response to it. And this response is both the real presence of American troops, reinforced aviation detachment, and then the ground troops that are\u2014component, as well as the declaration of President Obama to increase this presence even more. I would like to remind you that Poland is also making a contribution in the reconfirmation of an equal right of every member state to decide whether or not they are going to receive NATO troops in their territories.So Poland is participating in the air policing mission that is a mission to provide security for the air space over the Baltic States. We do it together with other allies from NATO, and we don't ask anybody for acceptance except for what is agreed within NATO internally. The same goes for the Poland's participation in the Afghan operation in ISAF. It was the reconfirmation of full solidarity and full coresponsibility for the decisions which are made not only for the military effort, but also for political decisions. Poland has been and shall continue to be a spokescountry for the solidarity within NATO. And that this can be manifested also in the denial of the right of anyone from outside of NATO to decide whether we can do something or we cannot do it.

Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about two things that might be on your desk over the next couple months as you prepare for a Trump administration. One is at least three-quarters of a million undocumented immigrants provided the Federal Government information about themselves and their families as part of your deferred action program. I'm wondering if there's anything you can do to either reassure them or shield that information from the incoming Trump administration, considering his stance on immigration.And the second is, the administration and you have long maintained that the legal restraints upon you by Congress governing the movement of detainees from Gitmo are an unconstitutional infringement on your right as Commander in Chief. Considering that the gradual transfers that you've pursued are unlikely to continue under a Trump administration, is this now the time to, sort of, test that theory by moving the detainees and seeing where the chips end up lying?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThose are both excellent questions. On the deferred action program that we have, known as DACA, that relates to DREAMers who are currently benefiting from these provisions, I will urge the President-elect and the incoming administration to think long and hard before they are endangering the status of what for all practical purposes are American kids.I mean, these are kids who were brought here by their parents. They did nothing wrong. They've gone to school. They have pledged allegiance to the flag. Some of them have joined the military. They've enrolled in school. By definition, if they're part of this program, they are solid, wonderful young people of good character. And it is my strong belief that the majority of the American people would not want to see suddenly those kids have to start hiding again. And that's something that I will encourage the President-elect to look at.With respect to Guantanamo, it is true that I have not been able to close the darn thing[]because of the congressional restrictions that have been placed on us. What is also true is, we have greatly reduced the population. You now have significantly less than a hundred people there. There are some additional transfers that may be taking place over the next 2 months.There is a group of very dangerous people that we have strong evidence of having been guilty of committing terrorist acts against the United States. But because of the nature of the evidencein some cases, that evidence being compromisedit's very difficult to put them before a typical Article III court. And that group has always been the biggest challenge for us. My strong belief and preference is that we would be much better off closing Gitmo, moving them to a different facility that was clearly governed by U.S. jurisdiction. We'd do it a lot cheaper and just as safely.Congress disagrees with me, and I gather that the President-elect does as well. We will continue to explore options for doing that. But keep in mind that it's not just a matter of what I'm willing to do. One of the things you discover about being President is that there are all these rules and norms and laws and you've got to pay attention to them. And the people who work for you are also subject to those rules and norms. And that's a piece of advice that I gave to the incoming President.I am very proud of the fact that we willknock on woodleave this administration without significant scandal. We've made mistakes, there have been screw-ups, but I will put the ethics of this administration and our track record in terms of just abiding by the rules and norms and keeping trust with the American peopleI will put this administration against any administration in history.And the reason is because, frankly, we listened to the lawyers. And we had a strong White House Counsel's Office. We had a strong Ethics Office. We had people in every agency whose job it was to remind people, this is how you're supposed to do things. It doesn't mean everybody always did everything exactly the way it's supposed to, because we've got 2 million people working in the Federal Government, if you're including the military, and so we had to just try to institutionalize this as much as we could. And that takes a lot of work. And one of my suggestions to the incoming President is, is that he take that part of the job seriously as well. Again, you wouldn't know this if you were listening to some news outlets or some members of oversight committees in Congress. [] But if you actually look at the facts, it works.And this is just one example of the numerous ways in which the Federal Government is much better today than it was, without people really knowing. You look at VA. People remember the legitimate problems that were publicized in Phoenix. It was scandalous what happened. What people don't remember is, is that we've brought in well over a million people who are getting benefits that weren't getting it before, driven the backlog for disability benefits way down, cut homelessness in half. Just made the agency work betternot work perfect, but work better.And one of the mottos I always had with my staff was, better is good. Perfect is unattainable. Better is possible.And so we will try to share the lessons that we've learned over these last 8 years with the incoming President. And my hope is, he makes things better. And if he does, we'll all benefit from it.All right? Thank you, everybody. You guys, some of you who are traveling, you'll get a chance to ask more questions. All right?[.]Thank you.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nTransfers of detainees from Gitmo and testing the theory about legal restraints\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. You have been a strong supporter of the idea of a peaceful transfer of power, demonstrated not terribly far from here, out in the Rose Garden. And yet, even as you and I speak, there are more than five dozen Democrats that are going to boycott the Inauguration of the incoming President. Do you support that? And what message would you send to Democrats to better demonstrate the peaceful transfer of power?And if I could follow, I wanted to ask you about your conversations with the President-elect previously. And without getting into too much of the personal side of it, I'm just curious, were you able to use that opportunity to convince him to take a fresh look at some of the important ideas that you will leave this office with: maintaining some semblance of the Affordable Care Act, some idea of keeping DREAMers here in the country without fear of deportation. Were you able to use personal stories to try to convince him? And how successful were you?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I won't go into details of my conversations with President-elect Trump. As I've said before, they are cordial. At times, they've been fairly lengthy, and they've been substantive. I can't tell you how convincing I've been. I think you'd have to ask him whether I've been convincing or not.I have offered my best advice, counsel about certain issues both foreign and domestic. And my working assumption is, is that having won an election opposed to a number of my initiatives and certain aspects of my vision for where the country needs to go, it is appropriate for him to go forward with his vision and his values. And I don't expect that there's going to be enormous overlap.It may be that on certain issues, once he comes into office and he looks at the complexities of how to, in fact, provide health care for everybody\u2014something he says he wants to do\u2014or wants to make sure that he is encouraging job creation and wage growth in this country, that that may lead him to some of the same conclusions that I arrived at once I got here.But I don't think we'll know until he has an actual chance to get sworn in and sit behind that desk. And I think a lot of his views are going to be shaped by his advisers, the people around him, which is why it's important to pay attention to these confirmation hearings.I can tell you that\u2014and this is something I have told him\u2014that this is a job of such magnitude that you can't do it by yourself. You are enormously reliant on a team: your Cabinet, your senior White House staff, all the way to fairly junior folks in their twenties and thirties, but who are executing on significant responsibilities.And so how you put a team together to make sure that they're getting you the best information and they are teeing up the options from which you will ultimately make decisions, that's probably the most useful advice, the most constructive advice that I've been able to give him. That if you find yourself isolated because the process breaks down, or if you're only hearing from people who agree with you on everything, or if you haven't created a process that is fact-checking and probing and asking hard questions about policies or promises that you've made, that's when you start making mistakes.

Thank you, Mr. President. There have been a lot of questions about the constitutionality--constitutional interpretations of a few decisions you've made, so I'll just simply ask: Do you believe the War Powers Act is constitutional? Do you believe that the debt limit is constitutional, the idea that Congress can do this? And do you believe that marriage is a civil right?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, that was a hodgepodge. [] Chuck, we're going to assign you to the Supreme Court, man. []I'm not a Supreme Court Justice, so I'm not going to put my constitutional law professor hat on here. Let me focus on, initially, the issue of . I want to talk about the substance of because there's been all kinds of noise about process and congressional consultation and so forth. Let's talk about concretely what's happened.Muammar Qadhafi, who, prior to Usama bin Laden, was responsible for more American deaths than just about anybody on the planet, was threatening to massacre his people. And as part of an international coalition, under a U.N. mandate that is almost unprecedented, we went in and took out air defense systems so that an international coalition could provide a no-fly zone, could protect--provide humanitarian protection to the people on the ground.I spoke to the American people about what we would do. I said there would be no troops on the ground. I said that we would not be carrying the lion's share of this operation, but as members of NATO, we would be supportive of it because it's in our national security interests and also because it's the right thing to do.We have done exactly what I said we would do. We have not put any boots on the ground. And our allies--who, historically, we've complained aren't willing to carry enough of the load when it comes to NATO operations--have carried a big load when it comes to these NATO operations. And as a consequence, we've protected thousands of people in ; we have not seen a single U.S. casualty; there's no risks of additional escalation. This operation is limited in time and in scope.So I said to the American people, here's our narrow mission. We have carried out that narrow mission in exemplary fashion. And throughout this process we consulted with Congress. We've had 10 hearings on it. We've sent reams of information about what the operations are. I've had all the Members of Congress over to talk about it. So a lot of this fuss is politics.And if you look substantively at what we've done, we have done exactly what we said to do, under a U.N. mandate, and we have protected thousands of lives in the process. And as a consequence, a guy who was a state sponsor of terrorist operations against the United States of America is pinned down, and the noose is tightening around him.Now, when you look at the history of the War Powers Resolution, it came up after the Vietnam war in which we had half a million soldiers there, tens of thousands of lives lost, hundreds of billions of dollars spent, and Congress said, you know what, we don't want something like that happening again. So if you're going to start getting us into those kinds of commitments, you've got to consult with Congress beforehand.And I think that such consultation is entirely appropriate. But do I think that our actions in any way violate the War Powers Resolution? The answer is no. So I don't even have to get to the constitutional question.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nConstitutionality of the War Powers Act\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Will it bring down prices. And the war has pushed prices up. They could go as high as $200 a barrel, some analysts think. How long is it fair to expect American drivers and drivers around the world to pay that premium for this war?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nAs long as it takes so Russia cannot, in fact, defeat Ukraine and move beyond Ukraine. This is a critical, critical position for the world. Here we are. Why do we have NATO?I told Putin that, in fact, if he were to move, we would move to strengthen NATO. We would move to strengthen us\u2014strengthen NATO across the board.Look, let me explain the price\u2014I suggested a while ago that what we should consider doing is putting a cap on the amount of money that we would pay for\u2014the world would pay for Russian oil, and that we would not\u2014there would\u2014we would not provide\u2014the West provides insurance\u2014would not insure Russian ships carrying oil. We would not provide insurance for them, so they would have great difficulty getting customers.The point is that we've said to them, Here's the deal: We're going to allow you to have a profit on what you make, but not the exorbitant prices that you're charging for the oil now. We've delegated a commission\u2014a group of our\u2014[inaudible]\u2014sherpa\u2014our national security people to sit down and work out that mechanism. We think it can be done. We think it can be done, and it would drive down the price of oil, and it would drive down the price of gasoline as well.In addition, at home, I have also called for changes. We've\u2014I've released a million barrels of oil per day from our oil reserve, and\u2014in addition to getting other nations to move forward\u2014a total of 240 million barrels of oil to release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Number one.Number two, I've asked Congress would they, in fact, go and end the\u2014temporarily end the tax on gasoline at the pump. And thirdly, to ask the States to do the same thing.If we do these things, it's estimated we could bring down, tomorrow, if they\u2014if Congress agreed and the States agreed, we could bring down the price of oil about a dollar a gallon at the pump, in that range. And so we could have immediate relief in terms of the reduction of the\u2014of the elimination of\u2014temporary elimination of the gas tax.And so I think there's a lot of things we can do and we will do. But the bottom line is, ultimately, the reason why gas prices are up is because of Russia. Russia, Russia, Russia. The reason why the food crisis exists is because of Russia: Russia not allowing grain to get out of Ukraine.And so that's the way in which I think we should move, and I think it would have a positive impact on the price at the pump as well.Jordan Fabian, Bloomberg.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow long is it fair to expect American drivers and drivers around the world to pay that premium for this war?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, sir. A two-part question: The New Yorker reports that the Red Cross has found the interrogation program in the CIA detention facilities used interrogation techniques that were tantamount to torture. I'm wondering if you have read that report and what your reaction to it is. And the second part of the question is, more than a year ago, you said that you wanted to close the detention facility at Guantanamo, and a year later, nothing has actually happened in that regard. Your Vice President, Attorney General, and Homeland Security Secretary are reported to be resisting such a move. I wonder if you could tell us who's really in charge on this issue. Are you doing anything about it? Do you expect Guantanamo to be open or closed when you leave office?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI did say it should be a goal of the Nation to shut down Guantanamo. I also made it clear that part of the delay was the reluctance of some nations to take back some of the people being held there. In other words, in order to make it work, we've got to have a place for these people to go. I don't know if you noticed a resolution of the Senate the other day, where all but three Senators said we don't want these prisoners in the country. I don't know if it was a 97-3 vote, but it was something-to-3 vote. In other words, part of the issue, Peter, is the practical issue of what do we do with the people?And you say nothing has taken place. I strongly disagree with that. First of all, we are working with other nations to send folks back. Again, it's a fairly steep order. A lot of people don't want killers in their midst, and a lot of these people are killers. Secondly, of course, we want to make sure that when we do send them back, they're treated as humanely as possible.The other issue was whether or not we can get people to be tried. One of the things I'm anxious about, want to see happen, is that there to be trials. Courts have been involved with deciding how to do this, and Defense is trying to work out mechanisms to get the trials up and running. And the sooner we can get that up and running, the better it is, as far as I'm concerned. I don't want to make any predictions about whether Guantanamo will be available or not. I'm just telling you it's a very complicated subject.And I laid out an aspiration. Whether or not we can achieve that or not, we'll try to. But it is not as easy a subject as some may think on the surface. Again, I refer to you to the Senate vote. When asked whether or not you want to shut down Guantanamo and, therefore, receive some of those prisoners in your home State, there didn't seem to be a lot of support for it. Like, three people said, It's okay by me, in the Senate.Your other question, sir?\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHave you read The New Yorker report about the Red Cross finding the CIA detention facilities' interrogation program to be tantamount to torture?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

I happen to come from South Texas. What I saw a lot of\u2014a lot of people struggling financially in the last few months. And so I think you\u2014I wonder what is the message you want to spread to them?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I try to express\u2014I've asked\u2014I've tried to answer that seven different ways today about how to deal with inflation. But let me answer the first question.I've spent a lot of time in South America and in Latin America. When I was Vice President, I spent the bulk of my 8 years basically in Europe and/or in Latin America. I'm in contact with the leaders of the countries in South America, and we're working closely with making sure that we do everything\u2014for example, with the\u2014to deal with helping the countries in question, particularly those in Central America, to be able to help them with their ability to deal with the internal\u2014people don't sit around in Guatemala and say: I've got a great idea: Let's sell everything we have, give the money to a coyote, take us across a terribly dangerous trip up through Central America and up through Mexico, and drop us\u2014sneak us across the border, drop us in the desert. Won't that be fun?People leave because they have real problems. And one of the things that I've done, when I was a Vice President, and got support with\u2014although I don't have much Republican support anymore\u2014is provide billions of dollars to be able to say to those countries, Why are people leaving? And how are you going to reform your own system? And that's what we've worked on a long time. It still needs a lot more work. And we're focusing on that.I also believe\u2014I've spent a lot of time talking about and dealing with policy having to do with Maduro, who is little more than a dictator right now, and the same thing in Chile and\u2014not the same thing, but with Chile, as well as Argentina.So, look, I made a speech a while ago, when I was Vice President, saying that if we were smart, we have an opportunity to make the Western Hemisphere a united\u2014not united\u2014a democratic hemisphere. And we were moving in the right direction under our\u2014under the last administration\u2014the Obama-Biden administration.But so much damage was done as a consequence of the foreign policy decisions the last President made in Latin America, Central America, and South America that we now have\u2014when I call for a Summit of the Democracies\u2014I called that, and a number of nations showed up for this Summit of Democracy\u2014what is it that's going to allow us to generate\u2014we've actually had a reduction in the number of democracies in the world. And it seems to me there's nothing more important.We used to talk about, when I was a kid in college, about America's backyard. It's not America's backyard. Everything south of the Mexican border is America's front yard. And we're equal people. We don't dictate what happens in any other part of that\u2014of this continent or the South American continent. We have to work very hard on it.But the trouble is, we're having great difficulty making up for the mistakes that were made the last 4 years, and it's going to take some time.Yes. Gentleman in the back. And then I'll go to this side, okay?\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat is your message for residents in the country who are struggling with high gas prices, grocery store prices, and pharmacy costs?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, sir. How comfortable are you\u2014sir, how comfortable are you with your Homeland Security Secretary saying, in the face of no credible intelligence of an imminent threat against the United States, that he has a gut feeling that one is coming this summer? And, sir, what does your gut tell you?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nMy gut tells me that\u2014 which my head tells me as well\u2014is that when we find a credible threat, I'll share it with people to make sure that we protect the homeland. My head also tells me that Al Qaida is a serious threat to our homeland, and we've got to continue making sure we've got good intelligence, good response mechanisms in place; that we've got to make sure we don't embolden them with\u2014by failing in certain theaters of war where they're confronting us; that we ought to continue to keep the pressure on them. We need to chase them down and bring them to justice before they come home to hurt us again.And so it's a\u2014this is a serious issue that is going to outlast my Presidency. As I say, this is the beginning stages of what I believe is a ideological conflict that\u2014where you've got a competing visions about what the world ought to be like. What makes this more difficult than previous conflicts is that there's the asymmetrical use of power. In other words, IEDs and suicide bombers are the main tactical device used by these thugs to try to achieve strategic objectives.Their objective is to impose their vision on the world. Their objective is to drive the United States out of parts of the world. They want safe haven. They love a society where women have no rights, just like the society that they worked to impose with the Taliban on the women of Afghanistan. That's their vision. And it's in our interests to defend ourselves by staying on the offense against them. And it's in our interest to spread an alternative ideology.We have done this before in our Nation's history. We have helped people realize the blessings of liberty, even though they may have been our enemy. And freedom has an amazing way of helping lay the foundation for peace. And it's really important, as we head into this ideological struggle in the 21st century, that we not forget that liberty can transform societies.Now, the interesting debate is whether or not a nation like Iraq can self-govern, whether or not these people even care about liberty. As you've heard me say before, I believe, strongly believe that freedom is a universal value, that freedom isn't just for Americans or Methodists, that freedom is universal in its application. And so when they voted in '05, I wasn't surprised; I was pleased that the numbers were as big as they were, to defy that many threats and car bombers, but I wasn't surprised.And this is the real challenge we face. And Iraq is just a part of a broader war against these jihadists and extremists, Mark. It is a\u2014this\u2014we will be dealing with this issue for a while, just like we dealt with other ideologies for a while. It takes time for ideologies to take root.I firmly believe that you'll see the democracy movement continue to advance throughout the Middle East if the United States doesn't become isolationist. That's why I've told you that I'm making sure that we continue to stay diplomatically involved in the region. Condi Rice and Bob Gates will be traveling there in early August to continue to remind our friends and allies that we're\u2014one, we view them as strategic partners, and secondly, that we want them to work toward a freer societies and to help this Iraqi Government survive. It's in their interests that Iraq become a stable partner.And I believe we can achieve that objective. And not only do I believe we can achieve; I know we've got to achieve the objective, so we will have done our duty. This is hard work. And one of the things I talked about in the opening comments was, do we do it now, or basically pull back, let the Gallup Poll, or whatever poll there are, decide the fate of the country? And my view is, is that if that were to happen, we would then have to go back in with greater force in order to protect ourselves, because one of the facts of the 21st century is that what happens overseas matters to the security of our country.Ed.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nPresident's opinion based on intuition\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to go back to the situation in Ukraine. If this cease-fire does take effect and appears to be holding, would you and your European counterparts back away from these sanctions that you say you've prepared? Or do you feel that it's important to levy these sanctions regardless of this cease-fire agreement? And if I could go back to the Rapid Response Force, can you say specifically what U.S. contributions will be in terms of troop numbers and equipment? Is it beyond the agreement that you announced\u2014or the proposal you announced in Warsaw?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWith respect to the cease-fire agreement, obviously, we are hopeful, but based on past experience also skeptical that, in fact, the separatists will follow through and the Russians will stop violating Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. So it has to be tested. And I know that the Europeans are discussing at this point the final shape of their sanctions measures. It's my view that if you look at President Poroshenko's plan, it is going to take some time to implement. And as a consequence, for us to move forward based on what is currently happening on the ground with sanctions\u2014while acknowledging that if in fact the elements of the plan that has been signed are implemented, then those sanctions could be lifted\u2014is a more likely way for us to ensure that there's follow-through. But that's something that obviously we'll consult closely with our European partners to determine.I do want to point out, though, that the only reason that we're seeing this cease-fire at this moment is because of both the sanctions that have already been applied and the threat of further sanctions, which are having a real impact on the Russian economy and have isolated Russia in a way that we have not seen in a very long time.The path for Russia to rejoin the community of nations that respects international law is still there, and we encourage President Putin to take it. But the unity and the firmness that we've seen in the trans-Atlantic alliance in supporting Ukraine and applying sanctions has been, I think, a testimony to how seriously people take the basic principle that big countries can't just stomp on little countries or force them to change their policies and give up their sovereignty.So I'm very pleased with the kind of work that's been done throughout this crisis in Ukraine, and I think U.S. leadership has been critical throughout that process.With respect to the Rapid Response Forces and the readiness action plan that we've put forward, in Warsaw, I announced $1 billion in our initiative. A sizeable portion of that will be devoted to implementing various aspects of this readiness action plan.We've already increased obviously rotations of personnel in the Baltic States, for example. We have the air policing. We have the activities that are taking place in the Baltic and the Black Sea. But this allows us to supplement it. It allows us to coordinate it and integrate it further with additional contributions from other partners. And what it signifies is NATO's recognition that, in light of recent Russian actions as well as rhetoric, we want to make it crystal clear: We mean what we say when we're talking about our article 5 commitments. And an increased presence serves as the most effective deterrent to any additional Russian aggression that we might see.Angela Keane, Bloomberg.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nOr do they believe it's necessary to impose the sanctions regardless of the cease-fire agreement?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

President Obama, could you confirm whether the blind Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng is under U.S. protection in Beijing? And how do you foresee that situation being resolved? Would the United States grant him asylum if he asked for it?And, Prime Minister Noda, how likely do you think it is that North Korea will carry out a third nuclear test? How would Japan respond to such a test? And what would you like the U.S. to do to respond?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nObviously, I'm aware of the press reports on the situation in , but I'm not going to make a statement on the issue. What I would like to emphasize is that every time we meet with , the issue of human rights comes up. It is our belief that not only is that the right thing to do because it comports with our principles and our belief in freedom and human rights, but also because we actually think will be stronger as it opens up and liberalizes its own system.We want to be strong, and we want it to be prosperous. And we're very pleased with all the areas of cooperation that we've been able to engage in. But we also believe that that relationship will be that much stronger and will be that much more prosperous and strong as you see improvements on human rights issues in that country.I know it wasn't directed at me, but I'll just make a quick statement around North Korea. This was a topic of extensive discussion between myself and Our consultation throughout the failed missile launch was, I think, reflective of how important our alliance is not just to our two countries, but to the region as a whole. And what I've tried to do since I came into office is to make sure that the North Koreans understand that the old pattern of provocation that then gets attention and somehow insists on the world purchasing good behavior from them, that that pattern is broken.And what we've said is, is that the more you engage in provocative acts, the more isolated you will become, the stronger sanctions will be in place, the more isolated you will be diplomatically, politically, and commercially. And so although we can't anticipate--and I don't want to hypothesize on what might happen in the coming months--I think Pyongyang is very clear that the United States, Japan, South Korea, other countries in the region are unified in insisting that it abide by its responsibilities, abide by international norms, and that they will not be able to purchase anything from further provocative acts. With regard to North Korea, between myself and President Obama earlier we--with regard to the so-called launch of satellite--the missile launch--we share the view that it undermines the efforts of the various countries concerned to achieve resolution through dialogue.Now, in the latest round of missile launch, they also conducted a nuclear test, which means that there is a great possibility they will conduct a nuclear test. And I believe the international community as a whole, together, will need to call for restraint on the part of D.P.R.K. And more specifically, I believe the measures incorporated in the recent U.N. Security Council chairman's statement need to be complied with. And among Japan, the U.S., and Korea, as well as and Russia, we need to communicate with each other fully and also call--stress that 's role continues to be very important and cooperate with while also maintaining close coordination with the United States. And we shared this view with And let me ask Mr. Imaichi of TBS, from Japan, to ask a question.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nPrime Minister Noda, how likely do you think it is that North Korea will carry out a third nuclear test?

Jonathan Karl, ABC News. Madam President, thank you. Mr. President, thank you. It wasn't that long ago you were talking about a reset with Russia and were optimistic that relations with Vladimir Putin could be dramatically improved. Did you misjudge him, or did he mislead you? And at this point, isn't it clear that sanctions simply are not going to change his behavior? And just a personal relations question: I'm sure you saw, President Putin was asked that if he were drowning, would you save him? And he said he thought you would save him. So I'm just wondering, was he correct on that? And do you think that Putin would save you? [Laughter]And to President Park, in light of the fact that, as President Obama points out, North Korea is already the most isolated country on the planet, the most sanctioned country, what do you think should be done specifically if they go through with another nuclear test?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nFirst of all, I absolutely would save Mr. Putin if he were drowning. I'd like to think that if anybody is out there drowning, I'm going to save them. I used to be a pretty good swimmer. I grew up in Hawaii. [] A little out of practice.Keep in mind that, when I came into office, the idea of reset was a recognition that there were a range of issues in which U.S. and Russian interests converged. It was in our national security interests to try to foster cooperation with the Russians so that, for example, we could have alternative supply lines to our troops in Afghanistan; so that we could obtain cooperation from Russia in applying sanctions to Iran and forcing them to the table to see if we could resolve that issue peacefully. And in fact, during the first term of my administration, the approach we took resulted in concrete benefits to the national security posture of the United States. We were able to reduce weapons of mass destruction. We were able to make sure that our troops were adequately supplied in Afghanistan at times, as you'll recall, when there were some tensions within Pakistan after we conducted the raid against bin Laden in Abbottabad. We were able to bring Iran to the table, and we now have what so far, at least, have been constructive discussions about resolving the nuclear problem there.So those were all things that were good for us, and I believe they were actually good for the Russians as well. Mr. Putin, in my second term, has had an increasing tendency to view the world through a cold war prism and to see Russia's interests as invariably in conflict with the West's. I disagree with him in my assessment of what's in Russia's interests, but he's the President of that country. There are still areas that we should be cooperating\u2014on counterterrorism, for example. But his decisions recently\u2014first, with respect to supporting the horrendous bloodshed carried out by the Asad regime in Syria, and then, most clearly, with respect to the situation in Ukraine\u2014makes it much more difficult for us to cooperate. And I suspect that that's going to linger for some time to come.We'll continue to look for areas where, if it's in our national security interests, and they think it's in their interests, that we'll try to find areas where we can work together. But the violations of sovereignty and territorial integrity in Ukraine is a principle that the United States has to stand up to.Now, with respect to the impact of sanctions, Russia has a deep interest in what happens in Ukraine, and I think they're going about meeting those interests in entirely the wrong way. But what's clear is\u2014you're right\u2014Mr. Putin is going to make decisions based on what he thinks is best for Russia, and he views Ukraine as absolutely central, critical to his foreign policy and the long-term strategic interests of Russia.That doesn't mean that he doesn't take into account other long-term interests of Russia. Tens of billions of dollars of capital fleeing Russia poses a problem for Russia's long-term interests. Russia being isolated so that no business man or woman with any sense are going to want to invest there. That's a problem for Russia's long-term interests. And President Putin is not a stupid man and, I think, recently acknowledged that this has already had an impact. And certainly if the situation gets worse and sanctions are broadened to an entire sector, that will have a more severe impact on the Russian people and the Russian economy.And so there's going to come a point at which he's got to make a fundamental decision. Is he willing to see the Russian economy that was already weakened, that was already faltering, weaken further because he's unwilling to deal with Ukraine in a diplomatic fashion that respects their sovereignty, but still meets any legitimate interest that Russia may have? Or is he going to use military force and the kind of destabilizing activities that we've seen so far? That's a choice that he's going to have to make. But we shouldn't make the choice easy for him. He should recognize that the international community as a whole is not going to encourage the kinds of actions that he's taken so far.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nDid President Putin correctly predict that President Obama would save him if he were drowning?

And we know you prize loyalty, so I wonder whether you felt betrayed by Scott McClellan's assessment of the war in Iraq?

What would be your advice to him as he tries to assess the situation on the ground?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nI have had no comment on\u2014no comment now on Scott's book.Secondly, I would ask him to listen carefully to Ryan Crocker and General Petraeus. It's\u2014there's a temptation to kind of get\u2014let the politics at home get in the way with the considered judgment of the commanders. That's why I strongly rejected an artificial timetable of withdrawal. It's kind of like an arbitrary thing, you know\u2014 We will decide in the Halls of Congress how to conduct our affairs in based upon polls and politics, and we're going to impose this on people\u2014as opposed to listening to our commanders and our diplomats, and listening to the is, for that matter. The is have invited us to be there. But they share a goal with us, which is to get our combat troops out, as conditions permit. Matter of fact, that's what we're doing. Return on success has been the strategy of this administration, and our troops are coming home, but based upon success.And so I would ask whoever goes there\u2014whatever elected official goes there, to listen carefully to what is taking place and understand that the best way to go forward is to listen to the parties who are actually on the ground.

You got these groups out there\u2014MoveOn.org, you know\u2014banging away on these candidates, and it's hard to kind of divorce yourself from the politics.And so I'm glad all the\u2014a lot of these elected officials are going over there, because they'll get an interesting insight, something that you don't get from just reading your wonderful newspapers or listening to your TV shows.John [John McKinnon, Wall Street Journal].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nAdvice to Senator Obama as he tries to assess the situation on the ground in Iraq\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

And we've already got strong bipartisan support for immigration reform out of the Senate. You've got\u2014I met with a number of traditionally very conservative clergy who are deeply committed to immigration reform. We've got the business community entirely behind immigration reform. So you've got a bunch of constituencies that are traditionally much more\u2014have leaned much more heavily towards the Republicans who are behind this.So if people are looking for an excuse not to do the right thing on immigration reform, they can always find an excuse: We've run out of time, or this is hard, or\u2014the list goes on and on. But my working assumption is people should want to do the right thing. And when you've got an issue that would strengthen borders, make sure that the legal immigration system works the way it's supposed to, that would go after employers who have been doing the wrong thing when it comes to hiring undocumented workers and would allow folks who are here illegally to get right with the law and pay a fine and learn English and get to the back of the line, but ultimately join fully our American community\u2014when you've got a law that makes sense, you shouldn't be looking for an excuse not to do it.

Businesses start seeing that consumers are out there with a little more confidence, and they start making investments, which means they start hiring workers. So step number one: job creation.Step number two: Are we seeing the credit markets operate effectively? I can't tell you how many businesses that I talk to that are successful businesses, but just can't get credit. Part of the problem in Elkhart, that I heard about today, was the fact that--this is the RV capital of America. You've got a bunch of RV companies that have customers who want to purchase RVs, but even though their credit is good, they can't get the loan. Now, the businesses also can't get loans to make payments to their suppliers. But when they have consumers, consumers can't get the loans that they need. So normalizing the credit markets is, I think, step number two.Step number three is going to be housing: Have we stabilized the housing market? Now, the Federal Government doesn't have complete control over that, but if our plan is effective, working with the Federal Reserve Bank, working with the FDIC, I think what we can do is stem the rate of foreclosure, and we can start stabilizing housing values over time. And the most--the biggest measure of success is whether we stop contracting and shedding jobs, and we start growing again. Now, I don't have a crystal ball, and as I've said, this is an unprecedented crisis. But my hope is that after a difficult year--and this year is going to be a difficult year--that businesses start investing again, they start making decisions that, you know, in fact, there's money to be made out there, customers or consumers start feeling that their jobs are stable and safe, and they start making purchases again. And if we get things right, then starting next year we can start seeing some significant improvement.Ed Henry. Where's Ed, CNN [Cable News Network]?

Mr. President, BFM Television. President Macron, for a year now, you've enjoyed a very friendly relationship with President Trump. Quite unusual, compared to the previous Presidents. At the same time, we can see that you do not agree on a number of topics. There are more and more of them. We've seen that openly in the Oval Office earlier on Iran. It seems like the initial deal with Iran will not be able to be saved. So what about this relationship? Can it have some concrete impact on France? Can it be beneficial to France and to Europe? You talked about reciprocal interests. Is that really the case today?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes, definitely. I believe the reason why we enjoy this relationship is because of the relationship between our two countries. Indeed, we have a different background, but it is maybe because we both are not politicians\u2014or typical politicians. And none of us easily change one's mind. And I think that if you listen to this press conference, you\u2014and watched us, you have the answer to your question.Regarding Iran, we have a disagreement regarding the JCPOA, but I think we are overcoming it by deciding to work towards a deal\u2014an overall deal\u2014that will enable us to deal with the issue of\u2014nuclear issue, but also treat it together with another three issues, which were not being dealt with so far.So should the decision\u2014I mean, we've spent more than an hour, just the two of us\u2014and had the conclusions been that the U.S.\u2014the United States of America would walk away from the JCPOA and France would not move, then our friendship would be wasted. But it is about making sure that we're each taking into account the position and the interests of our reciprocal countries.It is unprecedented. We've never before taken a joint position, a joint stance on Syria the way we did, and on Iran, in favor of a deal that will enable us to cover the four pillars. There is intense work between ourselves and our teams; otherwise, we would not have\u2014we would not be in a position to do as much.In the past, sometimes, France argued that it was time to take action against chemical weapons, and it was\u2014France was not followed by its allies, including the United States at the time. It is not what happened this time. We decided together what was possible and what was not. What was legitimate within an international framework, as two members of the Security Council, and we conducted an unprecedented military intervention at an unprecedented\u2014unprecedented\u2014level of cooperation.And please allow me to pay tribute to our troops, to our armies, and to that of the United Kingdom because we've led a unique operation, a proportionate one, and we were able to do so thanks to this relation that we enjoy.So on Syria, Iran, the credibility of the international community against the use of chemical weapons, you've seen it. You have the evidence that showed that the relationship between our two countries and our friendship enable us to achieve some concrete results. And this is an improvement compared where we stood a couple of weeks ago. Well, I think that we have very much in common, I must say. I think many things that we\u2014certainly, most things we agreed with, we can change, and we can be flexible. You know, in life you have to be flexible. And as leaders of countries, you have to show flexibility. And I think we actually get along on many of the subjects we discussed today. And I will say, France is a great country. And I believe France will be taken to new heights under this President. He's going to be an outstanding President, one of your great Presidents. And it's an honor to call you my friend. Thank you. Thank you very much.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat is the nature of President Macron's relationship with President Trump?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Hi, I'm Jongjin Park of Money Today. First of all, I would like to ask a question to President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea. I heard that you stated that a new chapter has opened in our trilateral cooperation with the two countries. Compared to the previous summits, what would be the most significant outcome that you gained through this summit?And also, from the perspective of our people, what would be the benefit that the people of Korea would feel from these strengthening of ties?And now my question goes to President Biden. During this summit, the issues of detainees or prisoners of wars\u2014and you mentioned that there will be further cooperation in these human rights issues. And you also said you will support the free and peaceful Korean Peninsula in the region. And what would\u2014what kind of shift would there be in your policy? And what kind of specific solutions do you have in this regard?Lastly, I would like to direct my question to Prime Minister Kishida. Today we had a historic trilateral summit. However, there was much backlash and many concerns in Korea. However, President Yoon showed his political courage to do so. That's the international community's evaluation.However, there are still concerns that the\u2014Japan is making very passive efforts to resolve our issues that still remain. And also, how would you be able to show your truthful willingness to resolve and improve our bilateral relations going forward?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nFirst of all, this trilateral cooperation amongst our three countries has opened a new chapter, and we made that announcement today to talk about the differences from the past cooperation.For instance, in the past, it was about individual issues that we sought cooperation among ourselves. But now, as we have opened a new chapter in our cooperation for security, economy, science and technology, and development cooperation for the Global South, health, and women\u2014across all of these issues, our three countries decided to closely work together. So it's much more comprehensive in nature.Such comprehensive cooperation has been launched by us today because currently we face complicated crisis and the threat from the D.P.R.K. And across the world, we believe that we can together make a contribution to freedom and peace around the world.So that is our foundational understanding and our common and shared interests of the three countries. And not just for exclusionary interests of ourselves. Our interests are well aligned with the universal interests of the members of the global community. That's where we find our shared interests lie.And at the same time, this framework of comprehensive cooperation among our three countries will contribute to global supply chain resilience, global financial market stability, cooperation in the frontier technology sectors and science.Our three countries together have the best-in-class expertise in science and technology. And we are the ones who are implementing liberal democracies. Naturally, progress in science and technologies will bring benefits\u2014tangible benefits\u2014to our people, not just in terms of security, but also in terms of economy and science and technology.But what is most important here is not about our own interests only. When we put our forces together, I believe that we can make a contribution to the advancement of freedom and peace in the world. And that's exactly where our interests are aligned. I\u2014look, back in May of 2022, I met with the families of the Japanese abductees during my visit, heard their stories, and empathized with them and got a sense of the pain they're feeling. It's real.We know there are many families out there who still wait and worry and wonder. And we're not going to forget about them or their loved ones.And there's clear language on this on our joint statement. The bottom line is this: That we share a common position; we're committed to working together to see the return of all prisoners of war and those who've been abducted and detained.And by the way, one of the things we get asked many times\u2014and it wasn't directly asked, but implied\u2014is what makes us think any of this is positive. Success brings success. When other nations see cooperation in the region, they make judgments about: Would they be better off if they made commitments? Will they move?Think about\u2014as students of history, all of you; and you are\u2014think about how many times successes have generated other successes when you don't anticipate it.And so I just think this is a\u2014we're not going to forget, we're not giving up, and we're going to continue to make the case for the freedom of all of those detainees. With regard to your question for me, first of all, I have strong feelings about strengthening bilateral relationships between the R.O.K. and Japan. I share that with The two countries, in dealing with international challenges, should cooperate. We're both important neighboring countries. And so friendship with President Yoon and a relationship of trust, based on this, both countries as partners should open up a new era. And that is my thinking.This year, President Yoon came to Japan, and I visited the R.O.K. At international fora, we have repeated meetings\u2014we have had repeated meetings. And between our two countries, including the economy and security, we've had forward-looking and concrete approaches which were started. It's already in motion, dynamically.Economic security dialogue was started\u2014or it has been decided on. In the area of export control, there have been progress. And also Financial Ministers and Defense Ministers have had meetings.And so we've had this very positive, forward-looking developments. And these are seen not only in the public sector. Also in the private sector, we see a slate of developments, human exchanges, and exchanges between business circles. We're seeing very active developments in all of these areas, and that is a reality.Going forward, we hope to accumulate these approaches with\u2014along with President Yoon to strengthen our bilateral relations even further. By generating results, we hope that people will understand Japan's feelings towards our bilateral relations. And we'd like to continue such efforts.Thank you. Thank you very much.Then, let me see.

Thank you, Mr. President. Just to follow up on Jackie's question. One of the reasons why so many of the people of the Occupy Wall Street protests are so angry is because, as you say, so many people on Wall Street did not follow the rules, but your administration hasn't really been very aggressive in prosecuting. In fact, I don't think any Wall Street executives have gone to jail despite the rampant corruption and malfeasance that did take place. So I was wondering if you'd comment on that.And then just as a separate question, as you're watching the Solyndra and Fast and Furious controversies play out, I'm wondering if it gives you any pause about any of the decisionmaking going on in your administration: some of the e-mails that Democrats put out indicating that people at the Office of Management and Budget were concerned about the Department of Energy; some of the e-mails going on with the Attorney General saying he didn't know about the details of Fast and Furious. Are you worried at all about how this is--how your administration is running?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first on the issue of prosecutions on Wall Street, one of the biggest problems about the collapse of Lehmans and the subsequent financial crisis and the whole subprime lending fiasco is that a lot of that stuff wasn't necessarily illegal, it was just immoral or inappropriate or reckless. That's exactly why we needed to pass Dodd-Frank, to prohibit some of these practices.The financial sector is very creative, and they are always looking for ways to make money. That's their job. And if there are loopholes and rules that can be bent and arbitrage to be had, they will take advantage of it. So without commenting on particular prosecutions--obviously, that's not my job, that's the Attorney General's job--I think part of people's frustrations, part of my frustration, was a lot of practices that should not have been allowed weren't necessarily against the law, but they had a huge destructive impact. And that's why it was important for us to put in place financial rules that protect the American people from reckless decisionmaking and irresponsible behavior.Now, with respect to Solyndra and Fast and Furious, I think I've been very clear that I have complete confidence in Attorney General Holder in how he handles his office. He has been very aggressive in going after gun running and cash transactions that are going to these transnational drug cartels in Mexico. There has been a lot of cooperation between the United States and Mexico on this front. He's indicated that he was not aware of what was happening in Fast and Furious. Certainly, I was not. And I think both he and I would have been very unhappy if somebody had suggested that guns were allowed to pass through that could have been prevented by the United States of America.He has assigned an Inspector General to look into how exactly this happened, and I have complete confidence in him and I've got complete confidence in the process to figure out who, in fact, was responsible for that decision and how it got made.Solyndra, this is a loan guarantee program that predates me that historically has had support from Democrats and Republicans as well. And the idea is pretty straightforward: If we are going to be able to compete in the 21st century, then we've got to dominate cutting-edge technologies, we've got to dominate cutting-edge manufacturing. Clean energy is part of that package of technologies of the future that have to be based here in the United States if we're going to be able to succeed.Now, the loan guarantee program is designed to meet a particular need in the marketplace, which is, a lot of these small startups, they can get angel investors, they can get several million dollars to get a company going, but it's very hard for them to then scale up, particularly if these are new cutting-edge technologies. It's hard for them to find private investors. And part of what's happening is China and Europe, other countries, are putting enormous subsidies into these companies and giving them incentives to move offshore. Even if the technology was developed in the United States, they end up going to China because the Chinese Government will say, we're going to help you get started. We'll help you scale up. We'll give you low-interest loans or no-interest loans. We will give siting. We will do whatever it takes for you to get started here.And that's part of the reason why a lot of technologies that developed here, we've now lost the lead in: solar energy, wind energy. And so what the loan guarantee program was designed to do was to close that gap and say, let's see if we can help some of those folks locate here and create jobs here in the United States.Now, we knew from the start that the loan guarantee program was going to entail some risk, by definition. If it was a risk-free proposition, then we wouldn't have to worry about it. But the overall portfolio has been successful. It has allowed us to help companies, for example, start advanced battery manufacturing here in the United States. It's helped to create jobs. There were going to be some companies that did not work out; Solyndra was one of them. But the process by which the decision was made was on the merits. It was straightforward. And of course, there were going to be debates internally when you're dealing with something as complicated as this.But I have confidence that the decisions were made based on what would be good for the American economy and the American people and putting people back to work.And by the way, let me make one last point about this. I heard there was a Republican Member of Congress who's engaging in oversight on this, and despite the fact that all of them in the past have been supportive of this loan guarantee program, he concluded, you know what, we can't compete against China when it comes to solar energy. Well, you know what, I don't buy that. I'm not going to surrender to other countries' technological leads that could end up determining whether or not we're building a strong middle class in this country. And so we're going to have to keep on pushing hard to make sure that manufacturing is located here, new businesses are located here, and new technologies are developed here. And there are going to be times where it doesn't work out, but I'm not going to cave to the competition when they are heavily subsidizing all these industries.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nCan you comment on your administration's lack of aggressiveness in prosecuting Wall Street?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Mr. President, thank you very much. About Vladimir Putin and your meeting this week: As you're well aware, the U.S. has been slapping sanctions on Russia for years for its malign activities, and Russia has not stopped. So what specifically will you do differently to change Vladimir Putin's behavior?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, first of all, there's no guarantee you can change a person's behavior or the behavior of his country. Autocrats have enormous power, and they don't have to answer to a public. And the fact is that it may very well be, if I respond in kind\u2014which I will\u2014that it doesn't dissuade him; he wants to keep going.But I think that we're going to be moving in a direction where Russia has its own dilemmas, let us say, dealing with its economy, dealing with its\u2014dealing with COVID, and dealing with not only the United States, but Europe writ large and in the Middle East.And so there's a lot going on where we can work together with Russia. For example, in Libya, we should be opening up the passes to be able to go through and provide food assistance and economic\u2014I mean, vital assistance to a population that's in real trouble.I think I'm going to try very much\u2014hard to\u2014it is\u2014and by the way, there's places where\u2014I shouldn't be starting off on negotiating in public here. But let me say it this way: Russia has engaged in activities which are\u2014we believe are contrary to international norms, but they have also bitten off some real problems they're going to have trouble chewing on.And, for example, the rebuilding of Syria, of Libya, of\u2014you know, this is\u2014they're there. And as long as they're there without the ability to bring about some order in the region, and you can't do that very well without providing for the basic economic needs of people.So I'm hopeful that we can find an accommodation that\u2014where we can save the lives of people in\u2014for example, in Libya, that\u2014consistent with the interest of\u2014maybe for different reasons\u2014but reached it for the same reason\u2014the same result.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nThe U.S. has been slapping sanctions on Russia for years for its malign activities, and Russia has not stopped.

President Bush, you have already voiced your support in favor of our medics and their release. We appreciate that. Although, despite the fact that our fellow country people are still in prison\u2014absolutely innocent, as you well know\u2014I would like to ask you, as a part of the general effort to solve this drama, which has been going on for more than 10\u20148 years now, my question is: Would you commit yourself to lobbying in front of the U.S. Congress and doing so that some of the funds under your 5-year program for fighting HIV/AIDS can go to supporting the children infected with AIDS and their families?And, President Parvanov, I would be happy to hear your view on the Libya issue, and, notably, how would you comment the fact, or rather the Bulgarian media's idea, who are covering the trial in Libya, to send a letter to the hundred most influential representatives of the economy and business, according to the Forbes ratings, and call on them to donate to the building of modern, up-to-date medical center where children, all people, with HIV/AIDS could be treated?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nThere's a fund into which we're contributing money. And I don't think you ought to be concerned about the source of the funding. What you ought to be focused on is whether or not the U.S. is willing to commit funds, along with the EU. And we are. And at the same time, we're willing to send messages to the Libya Government that we expect the release of the nurses. We've been very much in concert with your Government. This is an issue that we care about. And so\u2014but we do agree with the strategy that there ought to be some compensation for the Libyan children and their families. Ladies and gentlemen, many of you know that I have visited Libya; I have visited the hospital in Benghazi. I've spoken with the parents and the infected children, and I'm clearly aware of the great drama they're suffering, they're going through, and how much it needs to be done in order to invest in this hospital and in order to relieve the pain and suffering of both the children and their kin, and their families and friends.This is a Bulgarian; this is a European; this is a commitment of the entire democratic public, worldwide. By all means, Bulgaria and, I believe, our friends from the United States and the European Union consider this not a one-off, not a temporary\u2014an attempt to release the nurses, and then we quit. For us\u2014and I'm happy that this was\u2014we went along with George on this. For us, this is a long-term commitment. This is a commitment we take in respect of the both those suffering in Benghazi, but also everyone suffering of AIDS, not just in Benghazi, but in the whole of Africa. Let's remember G-8 and their decision: $60 billion were allocated to this policy by the world democratic community a few days ago.I, for one, 6 months ago, in addressing the European Parliament, I said\u2014and I appealed to the big players, so to speak, worldwide, in the businesses worldwide, to take a more\u2014a firmer commitment to this fund, to donate more, contribute more to this fund. In this sense, I join my voice and I welcome and I do support the appeal which the Bulgarian media have issued. I hope their voice will be heard. I know, whenever the media speak, their voice is heard more clearly than that of politicians.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow would you comment the fact, or rather the Bulgarian media's idea, who are covering the trial in Libya, to send a letter to the hundred most influential representatives of the economy and business, according to the Forbes ratings, and call on them to donate to the building of modern, up-to-date medical center where children, all people, with HIV/AIDS could be treated?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you very much, Mr. President. If I could follow up a little bit on North Korea, the North Koreans agreed last year to make their disclosure. We're now in April, and we've yet to see this disclosure. There are continued negotiations, a new round next week. Are you concerned that, given this record, they're not prepared to make this full disclosure, that they're stalling the process somehow? And if so, a question for both of you: How do you respond to that?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nYes, of course. I mean, they may be trying to stall. One thing about a nontransparent society where there's not a lot of free press, for example, or a lot of opposition voices, it's hard to tell what's going on. Now, he has made declarations, and he's testing the relationship. He's wondering whether or not the five of us will stay unified. And the only thing I know to do is to continue pressing forward within the six-party framework.The decision\u2014we've made our decision. We, the five of us, have made our decision, and that is, there's a way forward. And obviously, we hope he chooses to honor his commitments in a verifiable way. But it's\u2014when you're dealing with a society in which it's hard to get information out of, you just have to wait and see whether they're sincere or not. Unlike our society, of course, where there's all kinds of people in the administration talking and sharing information with you\u2014some of it authorized, some of it's not\u2014it doesn't happen that way in . It's a closed society. It's a society in which the will of one person decides the course of the future.And again, we're very hopeful. We talked about our mutual desire to keep the six-party framework in place to deal with a lot of issues. The first one, of course, is with . And it's\u2014I can just tell you, Steven Lee, it's much more effective to have more than one voice speaking on this issue than to be the sole voice speaking on the issue. And so if it\u2014if there ever is going to be a breakthrough, it's through the six-party framework.And look, I'm hopeful. We'll see. This has been a\u2014I've been at this for quite a while. And there's been moments where it looked like the process was going to go very smoothly and everybody's going to honor their commitments, and then for one reason or another, there's a\u2014there was a setback. But the key thing is, is that we haven't abandoned the efforts to solve this problem peacefully and diplomatically. Thank you. If you correctly understand and if you do understand n society, you'll probably get a better picture of why we are seeing some delay in the process at the moment. If wasn't like that, then we would have seen the resolvement of this issue already. We need persistent patience, ladies and gentlemen. And we need time in order to have complete resolution of this issue.However, it's difficult to convince to give up their nuclear weapons program, but it's not impossible. It is not impossible. I believe that. So in order to resolve this issue, I believe that the six-party talks is the most effective way and mechanism to resolve this issue, like the President mentioned. And right now we're in the stages of waiting for their declaration, and then we can move on to the verification process.So I think it's up to you to make the atmosphere so that can faithfully abide by their promise and make the right declaration, that once does so, it is also in their interest to make the correct decision to give a full and complete declaration. And it will also help the n people improve the quality of their life, and that is the best strategic choice that they can make.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nHow do you respond to that?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

You're about to embark on your final foreign trip. What will you say to other world leaders about your successor? They've expressed many of the same misgivings that you have about Donald Trump. Should they be worried about the future of U.S. foreign policy? And separately, as Democrats scramble to regroup after a pretty shocking upset, what is your advice about where the party goes now? And who should lead your party?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nGood. One of the great things about the United States is that when it comes to world affairs, the President obviously is the leader of the executive branch, the Commander in Chief, the spokesperson for the Nation, but the influence and the work that we have is the result not just of the President. It is the result of countless interactions and arrangements and relationships between our military and other militaries and our diplomats and other diplomats and intelligence officers and development workers. And there is enormous continuity beneath the day-to-day news that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order and promoting prosperity around the world. That will continue. In my conversation with the President-elect, he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships. And so one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the transatlantic alliance. I think that's one of the most important functions I can serve at this stage, during this trip, is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America's commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO relationship and a recognition that those alliances aren't just good for Europe, they're good for the United States, and they're vital for the world.With respect to the Democratic Party, look, as I said in the Rose Garden right after the election, when your team loses, everybody gets deflated, and it's hard, and it's challenging. And so I think it's a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to go through some reflection. I think it's important for me not to be big-footing that conversation. I think we want to see new voices and new ideas emerge. That's part of the reason why I think term limits are a really useful thing.I think the Democrats should not waver on our core beliefs and principles: the belief that we should have an economy that works for everybody, not just a few; the belief that America, at its best, is inclusive and not exclusive, that we insist on the dignity and God-given potential and worth of every child, regardless of race or gender or sexual orientation or what ZIP Code they were born in. That we are committed to a world in which we keep America safe, but we recognize that our power doesn't just flow from our extraordinary military, it also flows from the strength of our ideals and our principles and our values.So there are going to be a core set of values that shouldn't be up for debate, should be our north star. But how we organize politically I think is something that we should spend some time thinking about. I believe that we have better ideas. But I also believe that good ideas don't matter if people don't hear them. And one of the issues that Democrats have to be clear on is that, given population distribution across the country, we have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere. We have to work at a grassroots level, something that's been a running thread in my career.I won Iowa not because the demographics dictated that I would win Iowa, it was because I spent 87 days going to every small town and fair and fish fry and VFW hall. And there were some counties where I might have lost, but maybe I lost by 20 points instead of 50 points. There are some counties maybe I won that people didn't expect because people had a chance to see you and listen to you and get a sense of who you stood for and who you were fighting for.And the challenge for a national party is, how do you dig in there and create those kinds of structures so that people have a sense of what it is that you stand for? And that increasingly is difficult to do just through a national press strategy. It's increasingly difficult to do because of the splintering of the press.And so I think the discussions that have been taking place about how do you build more grassroots organizing, how do you build up State parties and local parties and schoolboard elections you're paying attention to and State rep races and city council racesthat all, I think, will contribute to stronger outcomes in the future.And I'm optimistic that will happen. And Ifor Democrats who are feeling completely discouraged, I've been trying to remind them everybody remembers my Boston speech in 2004; they may not remember me showing up here in 2005 when John Kerry had lost a close election, Tom Daschle, the leader of the Senate, had been beaten in an upset. Ken Salazar and I were the only two Democrats that won nationally. Republicans controlled the Senate and the House. And 2 years later, Democrats were winning back Congress, and 4 years later, I was President of the United States.Things change pretty rapidly. But it doesn'tthey don't change inevitably. They change because you work for it. Nobody said democracy is supposed to be easy. This is hard. And in a big country like this, it probably should be hard.Mark Knoller [ABC News].\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nWhat is your advice about where the party goes now?\n\nClassify the response clarity for this specific question.

Thank you, Mr. President. And two questions. There are concerns about how the immigration bill from the House , from the Gang of Eight\u2014in the House, has complicated chances for immigration reform in the Senate. It seems to be a more conservative proposal. Is there room for a more conservative proposal than the one presented in the Senate? That's immigration.And second, on Mexico, yesterday the Mexican Government said all contact with the U.S. law enforcement will now go through a single door, the Federal Interior Ministry. Is this change good for the U.S. relationship with Mexico? Do you think the level of security and cooperation can be maintained?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nOn immigration reform, I've been impressed by the work that was done by the Gang of Eight in the Senate. The bill that they produced is not the bill that I would have written, there are elements of it that I would change, but I do think that it meets the basic criteria that I laid out from the start, which is: We've got to have more effective border security, although it should build on the great improvements that have been made on border security over the last 4 to 5 years. We should make sure that we are cracking down on employers that are gaming the system. We should make the legal immigration system work more effectively so that the waits are not as burdensome, the bureaucracy is not as complicated, so that we can continue to attract the best and the brightest from around the world to our shores in a legal fashion. And we want to make sure that we've got a pathway to citizenship that is tough, but allows people to earn over time their legal status here in this country.And the Senate bill meets thatthose criteria, in some cases not in the way that I would, but it meets those basic criteria. And I think it's a it's a testament to the Senators that were involved that they made some tough choices and made some tough compromises in order to hammer out that bill.Now, I haven't seen what Members of the House are yet proposing. And maybe they think that they can answer some of those questions differently or better. And I think we've got to be open minded in seeing what they come up with. The bottom line, though, is, is that they've still got to meet those basic criteria: Is it making the border safer? Is it dealing with employers in how they work with the governments to make sure that people are not being taken advantage of or taking advantage of the system? Are we improving our legal immigration system? And are we creating a pathway for citizenship for the 11 million or so who are undocumented in this country?And if they meet those criteria, but they're slightly different than the Senate bill, then I think that we should be able to come up with an appropriate compromise. If it doesn't meet those criteria, then I will not support such a bill. So we'll have to wait and see.When it comes to Mexico, I'm very much looking forward to taking the trip down to Mexico to see the new President, Pe\u00f1a Nieto. I had a chance to meet him here, but this will be the first, more extensive consultations, and it will be an opportunity for his Ministers, my Cabinet members who are participating, to really hammer out some of these issues.A lot of the focus is going to be on economics. We've spent so much time on security issues between the United States and Mexico that sometimes, I think we forget this is a massive trading partner responsible for huge amounts of commerce and huge numbers of jobs on both sides of the border. We want to see how we can deepen that, how we can improve that and maintain that economic dialogue over a long period of time.That doesn't mean that we're not going to be talking about security. I think that in my first conversation with the President, he indicated to me that he very much continues to be concerned about how we can work together to deal with transnational drug cartels. We've made great strides in the coordination and cooperation between our two Governments over the last several years. But my suspicion is, is that things can be improved.And some of the issues that he's talking about really had to do with refinements and improvements in terms of how Mexican authorities work with each other, how they coordinate more effectively, and it has less to do with how they're dealing with us, per se. So I'm not going to yet judge how this will alter the relationship between the United States and Mexico until I've heard directly from them to see what exactly are they trying to accomplish.But overall, what I can say is that my impression is, is that the new President is serious about reform. He's already made some tough decisions. I think he's going to make more that will improve the economy and security of Mexican citizens, and that will improve the bilateral relationship as well.And I don't want to leave out that we're also going to be talking to, during my visit to Costa Rica, Presidents of Central American countries, many of whom are struggling with both economic issues and security issues, but are important partners for us, because I think that the vision here is that we want to make sure that our hemisphere is more effectively integrated to improve the economy and security of all people. That's good for the United States. That will enhance our economy. That can improve our energy independence.There are a whole range of opportunities, and that's going to be the purpose of this trip. And I'm sure that those of you who will have the chance to travel with me, we'll have a chance to discuss this further.All right? Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, guys.\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nIs this change good for the U.S. relationship with Mexico?

Thank you very much. Mr. President, I'd like to ask about two topics. First of all, what more specifically can the U.S. do to help Kenya in the fight against al-Shabaab? Do you still see Somalia as a counterterrorism model? And are you concerned about Kenyan authorities using counterterrorism as an excuse to commit human rights violations?Secondly, can you comment on the state of gay and lesbian\u2014the treatment of gay and lesbians in Kenya, which rights groups have called dismal and President Kenyatta has called a nonissue?For you, sir, President Kenyatta, on the same themes, what more do you need from the United States to help fight al-Shabaab, and are you getting it? And can you please also respond to criticism about the state of gay rights in your country?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, this was an extensive topic of conversation and concrete action that we're now taking. There has been extensive and effective counterterrorism cooperation between the United States and Kenya dealing with primarily threats from al-Shabaab.In part because of the actions that we've taken not just with Kenya, but with AFRICOM, and the efforts, collectively, of countries to work together\u2014Uganda, Ethiopia, others\u2014we have systematically reduced the territory that al-Shabaab controls. We have been able to decrease their effective control within Somalia and have weakened those networks operating here in East Africa.That doesn't mean the problem is solved. As is true around the world, what we find is, is that we can degrade significantly the capacities of these terrorist organizations, but they can still do damage. The number of individuals involved in Garissa or Westgate Mall were not large, but when they're willing to target soft targets and civilians, and are prepared to die, they can still do a lot of damage.And so what we discussed was the importance of, number one, continuing the effort to root out al-Shabaab's capacity inside of Somalia, working jointly. And as we speak, Kenya is working with Ethiopia and with the United States and others to further degrade al-Shabaab's space of operations inside of Somalia. So we have to keep that pressure going, even as we're strengthening the Somalian Government. Because part of the reason that al-Shabaab was able to emerge as a significant threat to the region was a nonfunctioning Government, effectively a failed state in Somalia for so long.There is now a Government and a cabinet that is credible and is working with the international community in Mogadishu. And even as we put military pressure on al-Shabaab, we also have to make sure that we're standing up an effective governance structure inside of Somalia. And we've made progress there.In addition, we have to continue to make progress in intelligence-sharing and being able to identify and prevent threats before they occur here in Kenya and elsewhere in the region. And part of our announcement today involves additional funding, additional assistance that we're providing the Kenyan security forces to deal with these very specific counterterrorism threats, as well as additional training and assistance to make sure that the approach that's taken in rooting out potential terrorist threats don't create more problems than they're solving.And this goes to the other element of the question that you asked. What we have found, sometimes through hard experience\u2014and I shared this with \u2014is that if you paint any particular community with too broad a brush, if in reaction to terrorism you are restricting legitimate organizations, reducing the scope of peaceful organization, then that can have the inadvertent effect of actually increasing the pool of recruits for terrorism and resentment in communities that feel marginalized.And I shared with him that one of the strengths in the United States, part of the reason why, although we're seeing potential lone wolf attacks inside the United States, that we have not seen this sort of systematic networks and cells developing in many of our Muslim communities or immigrant communities inside of the United States is, is that we've been very conscious to make sure that law enforcement is reaching out and cooperating and working with them, because they are our partners in this process. And the only way we're going to fight the poison that's being fed to them\u2014to their young people through social media\u2014is to make sure that they're our eyes and our ears and they're counseling us on how we can more effectively build trust and increase cooperation. And that's proven successful.The same will be true here in Kenya. And I was very clear to : Ultimately, the Kenyan Government is accountable to the Kenyan people, and it will find its way through this process in cooperation with us, but our experience and best practices tell us that rule of law, respecting civil society\u2014in fact, embracing civil society, particularly in those communities that may be targeted for recruitment by organizations like al-Shabaab\u2014that becomes more important the more significant the threat is. And not only is that practical advice, but it's the right thing to do, and it's consistent with the Kenyan Constitution and with the values that you heard espouse.Similarly, with respect to the rights of gays and lesbians, I've been consistent all across Africa on this. I believe in the principle of treating people equally under the law and that they are deserving of equal protection under the law and that the state should not discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation. And I say that, recognizing that there may be people who have different religious or cultural beliefs. But the issue is, how does the state operate relative to people?If you look at the history of countries around the world, when you start treating people differently\u2014not because of any harm they're doing anybody, but because they are different\u2014that's the path whereby freedoms begin to erode and bad things happen. And when a government gets in the habit of treating people differently, those habits can spread.And as an African American in the United States, I am painfully aware of the history of what happens when people are treated differently, under the law, and there's\u2014were all sorts of rationalizations that were provided by the power structure for decades in the United States for segregation and Jim Crow and slavery, and they were wrong.So I'm unequivocal on this. If somebody is a law-abiding citizen who is going about their business and working in a job and obeying the traffic signs\u2014[]\u2014and doing all the other things that good citizens are supposed to do and not harming anybody, the idea that they are going to be treated differently or abused because of who they love is wrong. Full stop. And the state does not need to weigh in on religious doctrine. The state just has to say, we're going to treat everybody equally under the law. And then, everybody else can have their own opinions.

Thank you very much, Prime Minister and Mr. President. Laura Kuenssberg, BBC News. Mr. President, you seem rather to have changed your tune from what you said earlier this week, when you said that, on the current Brexit plan, that would probably kill the possibility of a trade deal with the U.K. Our countries are meant to have a special relationship, yet you publicly criticized the Prime Minister's policy and her personally for not listening to you this week. Is that really the behavior of a friend?And, Prime Minister, is it a problem for you that some of the things Mr. Trump has said about your Brexit plan are right? It will limit the possibilities of doing trade deals easily in the future. Can you also tell us how it felt for him to criticize you in the way he did in that interview?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, maybe I'll go first, because I didn't criticize the I have a lot of respect for the And unfortunately, there was a story that was done, which was generally fine, but it didn't put in what I said about the And I said tremendous things. And fortunately, we tend to record stories now, so we have it for your enjoyment if you'd like it. But we record when we deal with reporters. It's called fake news. You know, we solve a lot of problems with the good, old recording instrument.But what happens is that\u2014look, the Prime Minister, as I really just said, she's going to make a decision as to what she's going to do. The only thing I ask of Theresa is that we make sure we can trade, that we don't have any restrictions, because we want to trade with the U.K., and the U.K. wants to trade with us. We're, by far, their biggest trading partner. And we have just a tremendous opportunity to double, triple, quadruple that.So if they're going a slightly different route\u2014and I know they do want independence. It's going to be independence; it's just your definition. But if they're going to go a certain route, I just said that I hope you're going to be able to trade with the United States. I read reports where that won't be possible, but I believe after speaking with the Prime Minister's people and representatives and trade experts, it will absolutely be possible.So, based on that, I\u2014and based on just trade in general, and our other relationship\u2014which will be fine\u2014but the trade is a little bit tricky. We want to be able to trade, and they want to be able to trade, and I think we'll be able to do that. Okay? And I think she's doing a terrific job, by the way.. Thank you, Mr. President. And just to confirm what the President just said, Laura, there will be no limit to the possibility of us doing trade deals around the rest of the world once we leave the European Union, on the basis of the agreement that was made here at Chequers and that I've put forward to the European Union. And just to be clear, that is an agreement that delivers on the Brexit vote that we had in 2016 here in the U.K., that delivers what I believe is at the forefront of people's mind when they were voting to leave the European Union.So at the end of these negotiations, we will ensure that free movement will come to an end. The jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice here in the U.K. will come to an end. The sending of vast sums of money every year to the EU will come to an end. We will come out of the Common Agricultural Policy. We will come out of the Common Fisheries Policy. And we will ensure, by not being in the Customs Union, that we are able to have an independent trade policy and do those trade deals around the world. And as you've heard from the President, the United States is keen for us. We're keen to work with them. And we will do a trade deal with them and with others around the rest of the world.Mr. President, would you like to select a person? Jonathan Swan, go ahead. /North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n\n### Specific Question to Classify ###\nMr. President, you seem rather to have changed your tune from what you said earlier this week, when you said that, on the current Brexit plan, that would probably kill the possibility of a trade deal with the U.K. Our countries are meant to have a special relationship, yet you publicly criticized the Prime Minister's policy and her personally for not listening to you this week.

And some of the statistics are disturbing, I think, to just about everyone. Anti-Semitic incidents have increased by 57 percent since 2016. Hate crimes are on the rise. Why do you think that is?

And, as you know, I've done more\u2014in fact, if you were with us the last time we met, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, This President has done more for Israel than any other President. Those words. Those exact words.Jerusalem, protection, working together\u2014so many different things. But the big thing is Jerusalem. You know, many, many Presidents have said they are going to build the Embassy in Jerusalem. Never happened. Making it the capital of Israel\u2014never happened. Never happened. But it happened with me and quickly.And not only did it happen, we built the Embassy. That would have taken another 15 or 20 years and cost probably billions of dollars, and we did it for a tiny amount of money. It's already done. It's open.Nobody has done more for Israel than Donald Trump.

Thank you, Mr. President. Convalescent\u2014convalescent plasma, as a treatment, has been around for, you know, a hundred years.

And was that holdup political in nature?\n\n### Full Interview Answer ###\nWell, I think that there might have been a holdup, but we broke the logjam over the last week, to be honest. I think that there are people in the FDA and actually in your larger department that can see things being held up and wouldn't mind so much. That's my opinion\u2014a very strong opinion. And that's for political reasons. This has nothing to do with politics; this has to do with life and death.So we are being very strong, and we are being very forthright, and we have got some incredible answers. And we're not going to let them be held up, because every day is lives. And we're not going to let that happen. Okay?Very good.
