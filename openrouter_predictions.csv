0, Inquiring about the status or information regarding the redline.,"Q. What about the redline, sir?","Well, the world has made it clear that these tests caused us to come together and work in the United Nations to send a clear message to the North Korean regime. We're bound up together with a common strategy to solve this issue peacefully through diplomatic means.Kevin [Kevin Corke, NBC News].",Clear Non-Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking for information about “the redline,” i.e., the status or content of a specific policy/threshold that has been referenced.

2. **What the answer provides** – The interviewee does **not** mention the redline at all. Instead, they speak generally about “tests,” the United Nations, North Korea, and a “common strategy” to solve the issue peacefully. The response never addresses the redline, never gives its status, and never clarifies anything about it.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – Requires the requested information to be explicitly stated. This is not the case; the redline is never mentioned.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – Applies when the information requested is *not given at all* (because of ignorance, need for clarification, or refusal to answer). The interviewee simply sidesteps the question and offers unrelated remarks, which is precisely what happened here.  
   - **Ambivalent** – Would apply if some partial or vague information about the redline were supplied (e.g., a vague allusion). The answer does not even allude to the redline; it is a deflection rather than a partial answer.

4. **Conclusion** – Because the interviewee completely omits any answer to the question about the redline and instead provides unrelated commentary, the response falls under **Clear Non‑Reply**.

1,Will you invite them to the White House to negotiate on the jobs bill?,Q. Will you invite them to the White House to negotiate on the jobs bill?,"I think that anytime and anyplace that they are serious about working on putting people back to work, we'll be prepared to work with them. But we're not going to create a lot of theater that then results in them engaging in the usual political talking points, but don't result in action.People want action. And I'm prepared to work with them. But again, the last time I was here at a press conference I said--I asked you guys to show us the Republican jobs plan that independent economists would indicate would actually put people back to work. I haven't yet seen it. And so eventually, I'm hoping that they actually put forward some proposals that indicate that they feel that sense of urgency about people--needing to put people back to work right now.All right, Jessica, you can't have four follow-ups. One is good. All right.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is seeking a clear answer about a specific future action: *Will the interviewee invite “them” to the White House to negotiate on the jobs bill?* The expected response would be a direct yes, no, or a conditional statement that explicitly addresses the invitation.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee talks generally about willingness to work with “them” when they are serious about putting people back to work, mentions avoiding “theater,” and references past frustrations with the Republican jobs plan. However, the response never states whether an invitation will be extended, nor does it give a conditional answer that directly ties to the invitation.

3. **Information type** – The answer is **partial and indirect**. It touches on related themes (cooperation, urgency, lack of a plan) but does not provide the requested explicit information about the invitation. It therefore falls short of a “clear reply.”

4. **Evasion or deflection?** – The response deflects the specific question by shifting to broader political rhetoric rather than answering the invitation query. This is characteristic of an **ambivalent** answer: it offers some related content but leaves the core question unanswered.

**Conclusion:** The response does not give a clear, explicit answer to the question; it is vague, indirect, and deflects the specific request. Hence it fits the **Ambivalent** category.

2,Why was it necessary for Japan to drop the threat of sanctions from its proposed Security Council resolution about North Korea?,"Q. Harsh. Mr. President, Japan has dropped the threat of sanctions from its proposed Security Council resolution about North Korea. Why was that necessary? And how do you punish or penalize a country that's already among the poorest and most isolated in the world?","I think that the purpose of the U.N. Security Council resolution is to send a clear message to the leader of that the world condemns that which he did. Part of our strategy, as you know, has been to have others at the table, is to say as clearly as possible to the n, Get rid of your weapons, and there's a better way forward. In other words, there's a choice for him to make. He can verifiably get rid of his weapons programs and stop testing rockets, and there's a way forward for him to help his people.I believe it's best to make that choice clear to him with more than one voice, and that's why we have the six-party talks. And now that he has defied China and Japan and South Korea and Russia and the United States—all of us said, don't fire that rocket. He not only fired one; he fired seven. Now that he made that defiance, it's best for all of us to go to the U.N. Security Council and say loud and clear, here are some red lines. And that's what we're in the process of doing.The problem with diplomacy, it takes a while to get something done. If you're acting alone, you can move quickly. When you're rallying world opinion and trying to come up with the right language at the United Nations to send a clear signal, it takes a while.And so yesterday I was on the phone with—I think I mentioned this to the press conference yesterday—to Hu Jintao and Vladimir Putin; the day before to President Roh and Prime Minister Koizumi. And Condi, by the way, was making the same calls out there to her counterparts, all aiming at saying, It's your choice, Kim Jong Il; you've got the choice to make.So we'll see what happens at the U.N. Security Council. I talked to Condi this morning first thing, in anticipation of this question, and she feels good about the progress that can be made there.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a specific reason why Japan chose to remove the threat of sanctions from its draft UN Security Council resolution concerning North Korea.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee talks broadly about:
   - The purpose of UN Security Council resolutions (“to send a clear message… to condemn that which he did”).
   - A general diplomatic strategy (“rallying world opinion,” “six‑party talks,” “red lines”).
   - Phone calls with various leaders and the overall approach to North Korea.
   - The difficulty of moving quickly when building consensus at the UN.

   The response never explicitly states *why Japan dropped the sanctions threat*; it instead offers a generalized explanation of diplomatic strategy and the need for multilateral consensus.

3. **Information type** – The answer is **partial and indirect**. It touches on related themes (the need for a unified message, the challenges of UN diplomacy) but does not give a clear, targeted answer to the specific query about Japan’s decision.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker shifts from the concrete question to a broader discussion of diplomatic process, which functions as a deflection rather than a direct response.

**Conclusion:** The response provides an incomplete, somewhat vague answer that does not directly address the question, fitting the definition of an *ambivalent* reply.

3,When will we see this resolution?,"Q. The Lebanese Prime Minister is demanding a quick and decisive cease-fire after an Israeli air raid today killed 40 people. When will we see this resolution? And if it's approved, when will we see a cessation of violence?","I'll let Condi talk about the details of what she's going to do today, if you care to hear from her. But we will work with our partners to get the resolution laid down as quickly as possible. And the resolution will call for a cessation of violence. And the concern, by the way, from the parties in the region is whether or not the resolution will create a vacuum into which Hizballah and its sponsors will be able to promote more instability.We all agree that we ought to strengthen this Government, the Lebanese Government—that's the purpose of the resolutions, as well as to stop the violence.I don't know if you want to comment upon—— First of all, we are working from what we believe to be a strong basis for a cessation of hostilities, that is the U.S.-French draft, a strong basis for the cessation of hostilities, and then as the President said, to have a process then that can address the root causes. And we also believe that it's going to be very important that this first resolution lay a very quick foundation for passage of a second resolution. So these have to be worked, in a sense, together.I spoke last night and yesterday with Prime Minister Olmert, with Prime Minister Siniora, with Secretary General Kofi Annan, with a number of others, and I think we believe that there is a way forward.Now, we understand that this has been a very emotional and, indeed, devastating and tragic set of circumstances for Lebanon and for Israel. And obviously, the parties have views on how to stop this. Their views are not going to necessarily be consonant about how to stop it. The international community has a view, but, of course, we're going to take a little time and listen to the concerns of the parties and see how they can be addressed.But I want to just note, we believe that the extant draft resolution is a firm foundation, is the right basis, but, of course, we're going to listen to the concerns of the parties and see how they might be addressed. And that's really what's going to be going on today, particularly after the Arab League meets and Prime Minister Siniora emerges from that. The President.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a concrete time frame for when “this resolution” will be seen (i.e., when it will be adopted or become public).

2. **What the answer provides** – The interviewee says the resolution will be “laid down as quickly as possible,” that they are “working … to get the resolution laid down,” and that it will “call for a cessation of violence.” However, no specific date, deadline, or schedule is given. The response is vague, refers only to future work and “quickly,” and does not answer the timing question directly.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – Requires the information to be explicitly stated in the requested form. The answer does **not** give an explicit time (“next week,” “by Friday,” etc.).  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – Would apply if the respondent gave **no** answer at all (e.g., “I don’t know,” “I decline to answer”). Here, some related information is offered (“as quickly as possible,” “we will work…”) but it is incomplete.  
   - **Ambivalent** – Fits when the answer is given but is incomplete, general, or deflects the request. The response offers a vague time‑frame (“as quickly as possible”) without a concrete answer, which is precisely the pattern of an ambivalent reply.

4,Updating the figure of Iraqi deaths,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Back on Iraq, a group of American and Iraqi health officials today released a report saying that 655,000 Iraqis have died since the Iraq war. That figure is 20 times the figure that you cited in December, at 30,000. Do you care to amend or update your figure, and do you consider this a credible report?","No, I don't consider it a credible report; neither does General Casey and neither do Iraqi officials. I do know that a lot of innocent people have died, and that troubles me, and it grieves me. And I applaud the Iraqis for their courage in the face of violence. I am amazed that this is a society which so wants to be free that they're willing to—that there's a level of violence that they tolerate. And it's now time for the Iraqi Government to work hard to bring security in neighborhoods so people can feel at peace.No question, it's violent, but this report is one—they put it out before; it was pretty well—the methodology was pretty well discredited. But I talk to people like General Casey, and, of course, the Iraqi Government put out a statement talking about the report.",Clear Non-Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking the interviewee to *update* the previously cited death‑toll figure for Iraq (i.e., to provide a new, revised number) and to state whether the 655,000‑death report is credible.

2. **What the answer provides** – The interviewee:
   - Declares the report “not credible.”
   - Mentions that General Casey and Iraqi officials also do not consider it credible.
   - Talks about the methodology being “pretty well discredited.”
   - Gives a general statement about Iraqi suffering and the need for security.
   - **Does not provide any new or updated death‑toll figure.**  
   The response therefore refuses to supply the requested updated statistic.

3. **Does the answer give the requested information?** – No. The core request—*to amend or update the figure*—is left unanswered. The speaker only comments on the credibility of the report, not on providing a revised number.

4. **Classification fit**  
   - **Clear Reply** – would require an explicit, explicit statement of the updated figure.  
   - **Ambivalent** – would apply if the answer were partially relevant but incomplete or vague.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – applies when the requested information is *not given at all* because the respondent declines to answer, deflects, or otherwise refuses to provide it.

   The interviewee’s reply is a direct refusal to supply the updated figure; it is a clear, unambiguous non‑answer to the specific request.

**Conclusion:** The response is a **Clear Non‑Reply**.

5,Do you think the Republican leader in the House owes somebody an apology?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd also like to ask an election-related question. The Republican leader in the House this week said that Democrats—he wonders if they are more interested in protecting the terrorists than protecting the American people. Do you agree with him, sir? And do you think that's the right tone to set for this upcoming campaign, or do you think he owes somebody an apology?","I wouldn't have exactly put it that way. But I do believe there's a difference of attitude. I mean, take the PATRIOT Act, for example—an interesting debate that took place, not once, but twice, and the second time around there was a lot of concern about whether or not the PATRIOT Act was necessary to protect the country. There's no doubt in my mind we needed to make sure the PATRIOT Act was renewed to tear down walls that exist so that intelligence people could serve— could share information with criminal people. It wasn't the case, Mark, before 9/11.In other words, if somebody had some intelligence that they thought was necessary to protect the people, they couldn't share that with somebody who's job it was to rout people out of society to prevent them from attacking. It just made no sense. And so there was a healthy debate, and we finally got the PATRIOT Act extended after it was passed right after 9/11. To me, it was an indication of just a difference of approach.No one should ever question the patriotism of somebody who—let me just start over. I don't question the patriotism of somebody who doesn't agree with me; I just don't. And I think it's unwise to do that. I don't think that's what leaders do. I do think that—I think that there is a difference of opinion here in Washington about tools necessary to protect the country—the terrorist surveillance program—or what did you call it, Hutcheson? Yes, the illegal eavesdropping program is what you wanted to call it—[]—IEP as opposed to TSP. [] There's just a difference of opinion about what we need to do to protect our country, Mark. I'm confident the leader, you know, meant nothing personal. I know that he shares my concern that we pass good legislation to get something done.Ken.",PARSE_ERROR,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct judgment on whether the Republican House leader “owes somebody an apology.” The expected answer would be a clear yes, no, or explanation of the speaker’s view on that specific issue.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not answer the question directly. Instead, they:
   - Re‑frame the phrasing (“I wouldn’t have exactly put it that way”).
   - Shift the discussion to a broader political tone, historical examples (PATRIOT Act), and differences of opinion.
   - Make a general statement about not questioning patriotism and that leaders should not do so.
   - End with a vague, non‑committal comment (“I know that he shares my concern…”) but never states whether an apology is owed.

3. **Information type** – The specific information requested (the speaker’s stance on whether an apology is owed) is **absent**. The response is a deflection that avoids giving a clear answer.

4. **Evasion check** – This is not a case of ignorance or lack of clarification; it is an intentional avoidance of the direct question, providing no substantive response to the “apology” query.

**Conclusion:** The response fails to provide the requested judgment and therefore constitutes a *Clear Non‑Reply*.

1. **What the question asks**  
   - The interviewer is asking for a personal feeling or perception: *“Do you ever feel like the walls are closing in on you in terms of support for this?”*  
   - The expected answer would be a direct response about whether the speaker experiences growing pressure or loss of support, i.e., a yes/no or descriptive statement about that feeling.

2. **How the answer addresses it**  
   - The response talks about flexibility, adjusting the plan, trusting generals, and not hearing people say “get out.”  
   - It never mentions *feeling* pressure, *walls closing in*, or any personal sense of encroaching difficulty.  
   - The answer sidesteps the emotional/perceptual aspect and instead discusses strategy and trust in military leaders.

3. **Information type**  
   - The core element of the question (the speaker’s feeling of being “closed in”) is **not provided**.  
   - The reply is **partial and indirect**; it offers related commentary on strategy but does not answer the specific query about personal feeling.

4. **Evasion/deflection**  
   - By shifting to a broader discussion of flexibility and trust in generals, the speaker **deflects** from the direct question.  
   - This constitutes a classic “dodging” response rather than a straightforward denial or admission.

5. **Classification decision**  
   - The answer is **not a clear reply** (it does not explicitly state the feeling).

7, Is the demand for Israeli troops to pull out immediately negotiable?,"Q. Lebanon's Parliament Speaker, Nabih Berri, who has been negotiating for Hizballah, has rejected the first resolution, saying it's unacceptable. They want the Israeli troops to pull out immediately. Is that a negotiable point? And also, Secretary Rice, will you be reaching out to Berri, as you had spoken with him before?","Whatever happens in the U.N., we must not create a vacuum into which Hizballah and its sponsors are able to move more weapons. Sometimes the world likes to take the easy route in order to solve a problem. Our view is, it's time to address root causes of problems. And to create a vacuum, Suzanne, is unacceptable. It would mean that we haven't addressed the root cause.The idea is to have the Lebanese Government move into the south so that the Government of Lebanon can protect its own territory and that there be an international force to provide the help necessary for the Lebanese Government to secure its country. Remember, in Germany, the first thing I said was—or one of the first things I said—I think I said this—help me out here, if I didn't—— I think you did. The President. ——was we want the Siniora Government to survive and to be strengthened. The linchpin of the policy is to support democracies. And so the strategy at the U.N., the diplomatic strategy is to support that notion because a democracy in Lebanon will not only help that nation address its long-term issues—such as rebuilding and providing a hopeful life—but a democracy on Israel's northern border will stabilize—help stabilize the region. We are committed to a democracy in the Palestinian Territory. President Abbas, in his conversations with Condi, talked about moving forward with democracy. There are people who can't stand the thought of a society based upon universal liberty from emerging. And that in itself ought to be a warning signal to those of us who care deeply for peace, that people would be willing to kill innocent citizens in order to stop the advance of liberty.Now, I've talked a lot about the universal appeal of liberty, and I readily concede some people aren't willing to—some say, well, you know, liberty may not be universal in this sense—America imposes its will. We don't impose liberty; liberty is universal.It's one of the interesting debates of the 21st century, I think, that some would be willing to say it's okay for people not to live in a free society. It's not okay for us. If you love peace, in order to achieve peace, you must help people realize that which is universal, and that is freedom.She asked you a question. Our point of contact for the Lebanese Government is obviously Prime Minister Siniora. As you know, I've also spoken to Speaker Berri on a couple of occasions.I understand how emotional this is for the Lebanese. They've been through a very difficult war. It's emotional for Israel as well. They're in the midst of a difficult war.Let me just say that in terms of what the end state will look like here, I don't think there is any disagreement that the right solution is the one that the President referred to. It's the Lebanese and the Lebanese Armed Forces able to secure their territory. And the international help is so that Lebanon can secure its territory. And I don't believe anybody anticipates that there should be foreign forces on Lebanese soil as a result of what has happened here.And so I think there is room on this issue to work on this issue, because everybody has the same vision—that it's the Lebanese Army, with support from an international force, that can actually prevent that vacuum from obtaining again in the south, so that we're not right back here 3 or 4 or 5 months from now, in the same situation.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a clear answer to a specific policy question: *Is the demand that Israeli troops withdraw immediately negotiable?* The expected response would be a direct “Yes,” “No,” or an explanation of the conditions under which it might be negotiable.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee launches into a broad discourse about:
   - Avoiding a vacuum that could be exploited by Hizballah,
   - The need to address root causes,
   - Supporting the Lebanese government and democratic institutions,
   - General statements about liberty and U.N. strategy.

   The response never explicitly states whether the “pull‑out” demand is negotiable. It mentions that a vacuum is “unacceptable” and that the Lebanese government should move into the south, but it does not answer the negotiability question directly.

3. **Information type** – The answer is **partial and indirect**. It touches on related themes (the importance of not creating a vacuum, supporting Lebanese sovereignty) but does not give a clear, explicit stance on the negotiability of the Israeli‑troop‑withdrawal demand.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker shifts the focus to larger strategic goals and historical context rather than answering the specific yes/no query. This is a classic case of dodging the precise question.

8,What are you offering the Arab nations to encourage them to participate?,Q. Secretary Rice said that failure is not an option. You talked about substantial issues need to be discussed. What is the minimum expectation from you that you will call this conference a success? And what you're offering the Arab nations to encourage them to participate?,"Right. Well, that's why Condi is making the trip she's making, is to explain to people in private, as well as in public, that, one, we're for comprehensive peace; two, that there is a—the meeting, the international meeting will be serious and substantive. In other words, as she said the other day, this isn't going to be just a photo opportunity. This is going to be a serious and substantive meeting.We believe that now is the time to push ahead with a meeting at which the Israelis and Palestinians will lay out a vision of what a state could look like. And the reason why there needs to be a vision of what a state could look like is because the Palestinians, that have been made promises all these years, need to see there's a serious, focused effort to step up a state. And that's important so that the people who want to reject extremism have something to be for.So this is a serious attempt. And I'm pleased with the progress. And the reason I'm pleased is because it appears to me that President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert are, one, talking—I know they're talking a lot—but they're making progress. And in order for there to be lasting peace, the deal has to be good for the Palestinians as well as the Israelis. Our job is to facilitate the process.Another reason I have an international meeting is to get Arab buy-in for a state. In other words, part of the issue in the past has been that the Arab nations stood on the sidelines, and when a state was in reach, they weren't a part of the process encouraging the parties to move forward. And so this is a—that's what I mean by comprehensive. It's comprehensive not only for what the state will look like; it's comprehensive in getting people in the region to be a part of the process. And so I'm feeling pretty optimistic about it.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a concrete description of the incentives or offers the speaker is extending to Arab nations to get them to take part in the conference.

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee says:
   - “the reason I’m having an international meeting is to **get Arab buy‑in for a state**.”
   - “**getting Arab nations to be a part of the process**.”
   - The answer also mentions “comprehensive” participation and facilitating the process.

   These statements directly identify what is being offered: **Arab buy‑in and inclusion in the process** as a means to encourage participation.

3. **Is the information explicit?** – Yes. The answer spells out, in plain terms, the offer (“Arab buy‑in,” “getting Arab nations to be part of the process”). It does not dodge, deflect, or remain silent; it gives the requested content, albeit in a somewhat general way, but it is still an explicit statement of the offer.

4. **Classification decision** – Because the requested information is explicitly provided (the offer is identified as “Arab buy‑in”/“getting Arab nations to be part of the process”), the response fits the **Clear Reply** category.

9,Isn't Tehran's influence in the region growing despite your efforts to curb it?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Iran has indicated that it will defy the U.N. on nuclear enrichment. It's been holding military exercises, sending weapons and money to Hizballah. Isn't Tehran's influence in the region growing despite your efforts to curb it?","The final history in the region has yet to be written. And what's very interesting about the violence in Lebanon and the violence in and the violence in Gaza is this: These are all groups of terrorists who are trying to stop the advance of democracy. They're trying to thwart the will of millions who simply want a normal, hopeful life. That's what we're seeing. And it's up to the international community to understand the threat.I remember, right after Hizballah launched its rocket attacks on Israel, I said, this is a clarifying moment. It's a chance for the world to see the threats of the 21st century, the challenge we face.And so to answer your question on Iran, Iran is obviously part of the problem. They sponsor Hizballah. They encourage a radical brand of Islam. Imagine how difficult this issue would be if Iran had a nuclear weapon. And so therefore, it's up to the international community, including the United States, to work in concert to—for effective diplomacy. And that begins at the United Nations Security Council.We have passed one Security Council resolution, demanding that Iran cease its enrichment activities. We will see what their response is. We're beginning to get some indication, but we'll—let's wait until they have a formal response. The U.N. resolution calls for us to come back together on the 31st of August. The dates—dates are fine, but what really matters is will. And one of the things I will continue to remind our friends and allies is the danger of a nuclear-armed Iran.But, no, you're right; this is a—they're a central part of creating instability, trying to stop reformers from realizing dreams. And the question facing this country is, will—do we, one, understand the threat to America? In other words, do we understand that a failed—failed states in the Middle East are a direct threat to our country's security? And secondly, will we continue to stay engaged in helping reformers, in working to advance liberty, to defeat an ideology that doesn't believe in freedom? And my answer is, so long as I'm the President, we will. I clearly see the challenge. I see the challenge to what these threats pose to our homeland, and I see the challenge—what these threats pose to the world.Helen [Helen Thomas, Hearst Newspapers]. [] What's so funny about me saying Helen? [] It's the anticipation of your question, I guess.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking for a direct assessment of whether Tehran’s regional influence is expanding *despite* U.S. attempts to curb it. The expected answer should address that claim explicitly (e.g., “Yes, it is growing,” or “No, it is not growing,” or a clear explanation of the administration’s view).

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does respond directly to the allegation:
   - He states, “*Iran is obviously part of the problem*.”
   - He lists concrete actions: “*They sponsor Hizballah. They encourage a radical brand of Islam.*”
   - He links Iran’s behavior to the broader threat (“*a nuclear‑armed Iran*… *a failed state in the Middle East are a direct threat to our country’s security*”).
   - He affirms the administration’s stance: “*we will… continue to stay engaged… to defeat an ideology that doesn’t believe in freedom*.”

   These statements are explicit, concrete, and directly answer the charge that Tehran’s influence is growing. The answer does not dodge, deflect, or remain vague; it names Iran, its actions, and the administration’s view of the threat.

3. **Information type** – The requested information (the administration’s position on Iran’s growing influence) is **explicitly stated**. The speaker does not leave the question unanswered, nor does he give only a partial or ambiguous reply. He provides a clear, substantive response.

4. **Evasion check** – There is no meaningful evasion. The answer moves beyond a generic statement and directly engages the allegation, offering specific reasons and policy intent.

**Conclusion:** The response provides the information requested in an explicit, direct manner.

10,. Has he changed?,"Q. Mr. President, on Russia, is the Vladimir Putin who said, The United States is undermining global security and provoking a new arms race, the same Vladimir Putin whose soul you looked into and found to be trustworthy? Has he changed? Are U.S.-Russian relations deteriorating?","I think the person who I was referring to in 2001 is the same strong-willed person. He is a person with whom I have had agreements and disagreements throughout the course of my Presidency and his. We've disagreed on the utility of NATO. I've tried to convince Vladimir that NATO is positive; it's a positive influence; that democracies on your border are good things to have. Democracies tend not to fight each other. And I firmly believe NATO is a stabilizing influence for the good, and that helps Russia. Evidently, he disagrees with that assessment; part of his speech was expressing concerns about NATO.There's a lot we can work together on, and that's what's important for American people to understand. We know that we've got common goals that make sense for both our peoples. Two such goals are , convincing the ians to get rid of its nuclear weapons. And Russia's leadership on this issue is very important to getting a Chapter VII resolution out of the United Nations. And by the way, they were constructive, in terms of the resolution I just described about North Korea. In other words, where we have common interests and we work together on those common interests, we can accomplish important things for the security of our own people as well as the security of the world.And secondly, Russia and the United States work very closely on proliferation concerns. We're both concerned about the proliferation of technologies that could end up hurting our people and other people in the world.And so there's—it's a complicated relationship. It's a relationship in which there are disagreements, but there's also a relationship in which we can find common ground to solve problems.

11,Shape of the multinational force,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On the issue of the multinational force, what shape should it take; who should lead it; who should be part of it? And also, should Hizballah agreeing to it be a precondition for setting up the force?And, Mr. Prime Minister, you talked about a resolution leading to a cessation of hostilities, and I'm just wondering, should it include a call for an immediate cease-fire?","In terms of the troops, that's what the meeting Monday is going to be about. And this is one of these issues that requires international consensus. People will put forth ideas, and we'll participate, in terms of trying to help develop a consensus about what the force ought to look like.In a general sense, though, the force needs to serve as a complement to a Lebanese force. See, that's the whole purpose of the force, is to strengthen the Lebanese Government by helping the Lebanese force move into the area. The whole cornerstone of the policy for Lebanon is for Lebanon to be free and able to govern herself and defend herself with a viable force.And so one of the things you'll see in discussions there is, how do we help the Lebanese Army succeed? What does it— what's required? What's the manpower need to be in order to help this force move into the south so the government can take control of the country. What it looks like— if I hold a press conference on Tuesday, I'll be able to answer that better. But since I probably won't be, read your newspaper.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a concrete description of the *shape* of the proposed multinational force: its composition, structure, leadership, etc.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee discusses the *purpose* of the force (to complement the Lebanese army, help the Lebanese government regain control) and mentions that details will be worked out in a meeting, but never specifies a concrete “shape” (e.g., number of troops, regional composition, command structure). The response is therefore vague and leaves the core request unanswered.

3. **Information type** – The answer provides only general, partial information about the force’s role rather than an explicit description of its shape. It is incomplete and indirect.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker shifts to talking about future meetings and “read your newspaper,” which deflects from giving a direct answer.

I wonder if you could tell us about—what you meant by that, what led you to that conclusion? And do you see any contradictory evidence in the culture?","No, I said—Mike, thanks. I was just speculating that the culture might be changing, and I was talking about when you're involved with making decisions of historic nature, you won't be around to see the effects of your decisions. And I said that when I work the ropelines, a lot of people come and say, Mr. President, I'm praying for you—a lot. As a matter of fact, it seems like a lot more now than when I was working ropelines in 1994. And I asked them—I was asking their opinion about whether or not there was a Third Awakening, I called it.I'd just read a book on Abraham Lincoln, and his Presidency was right around the time of what they called the Second Awakening, and I was curious to know whether or not these smart people felt like there was any historical parallels. I also said that I had run for office the first time to change a culture—Herman and Hutch remember me saying, you know, the culture that said, If it feels good, do it, and if you've got a problem, blame somebody else—to helping to work change a culture in which each of us are responsible for the decisions we make in life. In other words, ushering in a responsibility era. And I reminded people that responsibility means, if you're a father, love your child; or if you're corporate America, be honest with the taxpayers; if you're a citizen of this country, love your neighbor.And so I was wondering out loud with them. It seems like to me that something is happening in the religious life of America. But I'm not a very good focus group either. I'm encapsulated here. I'm able to see a lot of people, and from my perspective, people are coming to say, I'm praying for you. And it's an uplifting part of being the President; it inspires me.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct assessment: *Does the interviewee see any contradictory evidence in the culture?* The expected answer would be a clear “yes,” “no,” or a brief explanation of what contradictory evidence (if any) the interviewee perceives.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee launches into a long, tangential narrative about “speculating” on cultural change, historical awakenings, personal anecdotes, and prayers. He never explicitly states whether he sees contradictory evidence. He hints that “something is happening in the religious life of America,” but this is vague and does not answer the yes/no nature of the question.

3. **Information type** – The response is **partial and implicit**. It touches on the topic of cultural change but does not provide a clear judgment about contradictory evidence. Instead, it deflects and offers speculation rather than a direct answer.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The answer avoids giving a straightforward response; it shifts focus to unrelated personal reflections and historical analogies.

13,What have they achieved and what will they leave behind for their successors?,"Q. My question is—first to both Presidents—you mentioned that yesterday and today you summed up the 8 years of your cooperation. I would like to ask you, if you assess your work, have there been more pluses or minuses? And please tell me, what have you achieved, and what concrete things will be bequeathed to your successors? Do you think the world has become a safer and more secure place? And how has the U.S.-Russian relationship influenced world politics?And my question to the United States now—to the President of the United States now—you have met President-elect today— Dmitry Medvedev. You talked about the impression you have of him. I would like to ask you, did you discuss the schedule of your further exchanges with him in the course of this year—for the remaining part of this year?","Okay, I will start answering. Has it become better, or has it become worse? We always want to have more of a good thing, and we shouldn't forget that the—as we say, the better is the worst enemy of the good.Let us remember the world on the brink of a nuclear disaster during the Caribbean crisis, and now let us look at the U.S.Russia relationship today. A crisis like the Cuban crisis would not be possible now; it would be unthinkable. I agree with George when he said that Russia and the United States no longer consider each other as enemies. At a minimum, they look at each other as partners, and I believe this is very important.Of course, a lot of outstanding issues remain. It is true that we do have disagreements on some sensitive areas of our cooperation, but at the same time, we do have enough strength to search for solutions. And as our meeting today has shown, we are capable of achieving positive re-sults—that is, on the whole—in counterterrorism, in fighting proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missile technology, of fighting the drug threat. All of these create a reliable platform for cooperation, not only between Russia and the United States but a platform that contributes to ensuring international security.If we mention on top of that our economic cooperation, we can state that in the past 8 years, we have been able to improve the relations between our two countries and in the world as a whole. Yes, I agree with that answer. And secondly, I spent—I told President-elect that I would see him in Japan at the G-8, and that's the only scheduling matters that we discussed. And I'm going to finish out my term—my time with Vladimir, and then I'll turn my attention to the President when he gets to be the President. But the first time I suspect we'll meet will be in the scheduled meeting in Japan.Thank you.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants two concrete pieces of information:  
   a) *What have they achieved?* (i.e., concrete accomplishments of the past 8‑year cooperation)  
   b) *What will they leave behind for their successors?* (i.e., the legacy or bequest they will hand over).

2. **How the answer addresses it** –  
   - The respondent **does list several achievements** in explicit terms: improvement of U.S.–Russia relations, cooperation in counter‑terrorism, non‑proliferation, missile‑technology control, drug‑threat mitigation, and broader economic cooperation.  
   - However, the answer **does not clearly state what will be “bequeathed”** to successors. It mentions a future scheduling matter (a meeting in Japan) and that the speaker will finish the current term, but it never articulates a concrete legacy or set of inheritances for the next leaders.

3. **Information type** – Because the response provides a **partial, somewhat general answer** to the first part (achievements) but **fails to give a clear, explicit answer to the second part** (what will be left behind), the reply is incomplete with respect to the full request.

4. **Evasion/deflection?** – The speaker does not dodge the question entirely; they do discuss achievements. Yet they do not deliver a definitive statement about the legacy, leaving that portion unanswered.

**Conclusion:** The response is **not a clear, complete answer** to the whole question. It supplies some explicit achievements but leaves the “what will be bequeathed” component only implicit or omitted. This fits the definition of an **Ambivalent** response—information is given but in an incomplete, partial manner.

14,Are you willing to acknowledge that a change may be needed?,"Q. Senator Warner says Iraq appears to be drifting sideways, and James Baker says a change in strategy may be needed. Are you willing to acknowledge that a change may be needed?","Steve, we're constantly changing tactics to achieve a strategic goal. Our strategic goal is a country which can defend itself, sustain itself, and govern itself. The strategic goal is to help this young democracy succeed in a world in which extremists are trying to intimidate rational people in order to topple moderate governments and to extend a caliphate.The stakes couldn't be any higher, as I said earlier, in the world in which we live. There are extreme elements that use religion to achieve objectives. And they want us to leave, and they want us to—and they want to topple government. They want to extend an ideological caliphate that is—has no concept of liberty inherent in their beliefs. They want to control oil resources, and they want to plot and plan and attack us again. That's their objectives. And so— and our strategic objective is to prevent them from doing that. And we're constantly changing tactics to achieve that objective.And I appreciate Senator Warner going over there and taking a look. I want you to notice, what he did say is, if the plan is now not working—the plan that's in place isn't working, America needs to adjust. I completely agree. That's what I talk to General Casey about. I said, General, the Baghdad security plan is in its early implementation. I support you strongly, but if you come into this office and say we need to do something differently, I support you. If you need more troops, I support you. If you're going to devise a new strategy, we're with you, because I trust General Casey to make the judgments necessary to put the tactics in place to help us achieve an objective.And I appreciate Jimmy Baker—willingness to—he and Lee Hamilton are putting this—have got a group they put together that I think was Congressman Wolf's suggestion—or passing the law. We supported the idea. I think it's good to have some of our elder statesmen—I hate to call Baker an elder statesmen—but to go over there and take a look and to come back and make recommendations. Somebody said he said, Well, you know, cut-and-run isn't working. That's not our policy. Our policy is to help this country succeed, because I understand the stakes. And I'm going to repeat them one more time. As a matter of fact, I'm going to spend a lot of time repeating the stakes about what life is like in the Middle East.It is conceivable that there will be a world in which radical forms, extreme forms of religion fight each other for influence in the Middle East, in which they've got the capacity to use oil as an economic weapon. And when you throw in the mix a nuclear weapon in the hands of a sworn enemy of the United States, you begin to see an environment that would cause some later on in history to look back and say, How come they couldn't see the problem? What happened to them in the year 2006? Why weren't they able to see the problems now and deal with them before it came too late?, Steve.And so Iraq is an important part of dealing with this problem. And my vow to the American people is, I understand the stakes, and I understand what it would mean for us to leave before the job is done. And I look forward to listening how—what Jimmy Baker and Lee Hamilton say about how to get the job done. I appreciate them working on this issue because I think they understand what I know, and the stakes are high.And the stakes are high when it comes to developing a Palestinian state so that Israel can live at peace. And the stakes are high when it comes to making sure the young democracy of Lebanon is able to fend off the extremists and radicals that want to crater that democracy.This is the real challenge of the 21st century. I like to tell people we're in an ideological struggle. And it's a struggle between extremists and radicals and people of moderation who want to simply live a peaceful life. And the calling of this country and in this century is whether or not we will help the forces of moderation prevail. That's the fundamental question facing the United States of America—beyond my Presidency. And you can tell I made my choice. And I made my choice because the most solemn duty of the American President and government is to protect this country from harm.Martha [Martha Raddatz, ABC News]. Yes.

15,Messages for the Governments of Iran and Syria,"Q. Thank you. Mr. President and Prime Minister Blair, can I ask you both tonight what your messages are for the Governments of Iran and Syria, given that you say this is the crisis of the 21st century?","Want me to start? My message is, give up your nuclear weapon and your nuclear weapon ambitions. That's my message to Syria—I mean, to Iran. And my message to Syria is, become an active participant in the neighborhood for peace. The message is very, very simple to them. It is that you have a choice. Iran and Syria have a choice. And they may think that they can avoid this choice; in fact, they can't. And when things are set in train, like what has happened in Lebanon over the past few weeks, it only, in my view, underscores the fact they have this choice. They can either come in and participate as proper and responsible members of the international community, or they will face the risk of increasing confrontation.And coming in and being proper members of the international community does not mean—though I would love to see both Syria and Iran proper democracies—does not mean to say that we insist that they change their government or even their system of government, although, of course, we want to see change in those countries. But it does mean Iran abides by its obligations under the nuclear weapons treaty. It does mean that Iran and Syria stop supporting terrorism. It does mean that instead of trying to prevent the democratically elected government of Iraq fulfill its mandate, they allow it to fulfill its mandate.Now, that's their choice. It's a perfectly simple one. They can either decide they are going to abide by the rules of the international community or continue to transgress them. And look, in the end, that's the choice that they will have to make. But where I think they make a strategic miscalculation is if they think that because of all the other issues that we have to resolve and so on, that we are indifferent to what they are doing. There will be no sidetracking of our determination, for example, to make sure that Iran is fully compliant with the call that's been made on them from the whole of the international community in respect of nuclear weapons capability. And I hope they realize there is a different relationship that is possible with the international community, but only on the basis that has been set out.

1. **What the question asks:**  
   The interviewer wants a clear statement of the interviewee’s *philosophy* or guiding principle for granting Presidential pardons.

2. **What the answer provides:**  
   - The interviewee mentions that “we have a strict criterion that we utilize—​we being the Justice Department and the White House Counsel.”  
   - He says he “hasn’t compared the number of pardons… to any other President” and that “a scorecard should, necessarily, be the guidepost for pardoning people.”  
   - The response stops short of describing any concrete philosophy; it merely references a “strict criterion” without explaining what that criterion is or how it shapes his approach.

3. **Evaluation against the categories:**  
   - **Clear Reply?** No – the answer does not explicitly state a philosophy (e.g., “I grant pardons only when…”) but instead offers a vague reference to an unspecified “strict criterion.”  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply?** No – some relevant information is given (the existence of a “strict criterion” and that a scorecard isn’t the guidepost).  
   - **Ambivalent?** Yes – the answer is incomplete and partially deflects the question, offering only a general, implicit hint about a criterion without elaborating on the underlying philosophy.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking for a direct stance: *Would you campaign against Senator Joe Lieberman on Iraq?* The expected response should be a clear yes, no, or qualified answer addressing that specific political decision.

2. **What the answer provides** – The interviewee replies, “I’m going to stay out of Connecticut.”  
   - This statement does **not** address the question about campaigning against Lieberman on Iraq.  
   - It is a vague, unrelated deflection that avoids stating any position on the Iraq issue or on Lieberman.  
   - It effectively **declines to answer** the specific query.

3. **Matching to the classification categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – Not applicable; the answer does not explicitly state the requested information.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – Applies because the respondent **does not give any information** about whether they would campaign against Lieberman on Iraq; they simply refuse to engage with the question.  
   - **Ambivalent** – Would apply only if the answer partially addressed the question but was incomplete or evasive. Here the answer **avoids the question altogether**, which fits the “Clear Non‑Reply” definition (declining to answer).

**Conclusion:** The response is a clear non‑reply to the question.

18,Would you veto the bill if it passes in the form that the Armed Services Committee approved yesterday?,"Q. Mr. President, your administration had all summer to negotiate with lawmakers on the detainee legislation. How is it that you now find yourself in a situation where you have essentially an open rebellion on Capitol Hill led by some of the leading members of your own party, very respected voices in military affairs? And secondly, would you veto the bill if it passes in the form that the Armed Services Committee approved yesterday?","First, we have been working throughout the summer, talking to key players about getting a bill that will enable the program to go forward, and was pleased that the House of Representatives passed a good bill with an overwhelming bipartisan majority out of their committee, the Armed Services Committee. And I felt that was good progress. And obviously, we've got a little work to do in the Senate, and we'll continue making our case. But, no, we've been involved—ever since the Supreme Court decision came down, Sheryl, we've been talking about both the military tribunals and this Article 3 of the Geneva Convention.The Article 3 of the Geneva Convention is hard for a lot of citizens to understand. But let's see if I can put it this way for people to understand. There is a very vague standard that the Court said must kind of be the guide for our conduct in the war on terror and the detainee policy. It's so vague that it's impossible to ask anybody to participate in the program for fear— for that person having the fear of breaking the law. That's the problem.And so we worked with members of both bodies and both parties to try to help bring some definition to Common Article 3. I really don't think most Americans want international courts being able to determine how we protect ourselves. And my assurance to people is that we can pass law here in the United States that helps define our treaty—international treaty obligations. We have done that in the past. It is not the first time that we have done this. And I believe it's necessary to do it this time in order for the program to go forward.

1. **What the question asks:**  
   The interviewer is asking for a direct, binary answer: *Will the President veto the bill if it passes in the form that the Armed Services Committee approved yesterday?* The expected response is a clear “yes,” “no,” or a statement indicating a decision.

2. **How the answer addresses it:**  
   The interviewee does **not** give a yes/no or any explicit stance on a veto. Instead, the response talks about:
   - Working throughout the summer with key players.  
   - The House passing a bipartisan bill.  
   - Ongoing work in the Senate.  
   - General discussion of Article 3 of the Geneva Convention and the need to define treaty obligations.  
   - No mention of a veto decision, nor any conditional language about it.

3. **Nature of the response:**  
   - The answer is **deflective** and **general**; it provides context but never answers the specific question.  
   - It does not decline to answer outright, nor does it express ignorance; it simply sidesteps the question.  
   - This matches the definition of an **Ambivalent** response: the requested information is given **in an incomplete, partial, or implicit way**, involving deflection rather than a clear statement.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   Because the response offers a vague, indirect answer that fails to address the veto question directly, it is best classified as **Ambivalent**.

19,What makes this more than a piece of paper if you don't have the will of the international community to back it up?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Back to Lebanon. The Lebanese Prime Minister, over the weekend, said that Israel flagrantly violated the cease-fire with its raid into Lebanon. And so far, the European allies who've committed forces, the U.N. security peacekeeping forces, have expressed reservations; those Muslim nations who've offered troops have been shunned by Israeli officials. Why shouldn't we see the cease-fire as one that essentially is falling apart? And what makes this more than a piece of paper if you don't have the will of the international community to back it up?","Yes. No, listen—all the more reason why we need to help our friends and allies get the forces necessary to help the Lebanese forces keep the cessation of hostilities in place, intact. And that's why we're working with friends, with allies, with Security Council members, to make sure the force that is committed is robust and the rules of engagement are clear. And so it's an ongoing series of conversations and discussions, and hopefully, this will happen quite quickly.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants to know *what specific factor or mechanism* makes the cease‑fire “more than a piece of paper” when the international community’s will is lacking. In other words, they are asking for the concrete reason or set of actions that would give the agreement substance.

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee does not directly answer the “what makes it more than a piece of paper?” query. Instead, they shift the focus to:
   - Helping friends and allies obtain the forces needed.
   - Working with allies and Security‑Council members.
   - Ensuring a robust force and clear rules of engagement.
   - Ongoing conversations that “hopefully… will happen quite quickly.”

   These points are related to the broader topic of supporting Lebanon, but they do not explicitly state *what* makes the cease‑fire substantive beyond a “piece of paper.” The response is vague, general, and deflects from the precise question.

3. **Information type** – The answer provides only partial, implicit information. It hints at “robust force” and “clear rules of engagement” as reasons the agreement would have weight, but it never directly addresses the core of the question (i.e., the mechanism that transforms a paper agreement into an enforceable one when international will is weak).

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The response steers the conversation toward a broader policy narrative rather than giving a clear, targeted explanation. This fits the pattern of a *deflection* or *partial answer*.

5. **Classification decision** – Because the answer is incomplete, indirect, and only partially addresses the requested information, it falls into the **Ambivalent** category—information is given but in an incomplete, indirect, and somewhat evasive manner.

20, Fear and concern in Israel that the administration will not take necessary action against Iran due to the duration and unpopularity of the war in Iraq.,"Q. [Inaudible]—Israel's finding about Iran are completely different than the NIE report. Given the duration and the unpopularity of the war in Iraq, there is a fear, a concern in Israel that your administration will not take the necessary action against Iran.[At this point, the reporter asked a question in Hebrew, which was translated by an interpreter as follows.]And the question to Prime Minister Olmert: Did you perhaps present to Mr. Bush positions that run counter to those of the Americans, and perhaps you are concerned that what he said now actually indicates that his hands are tied when it comes to Iran?","[Inaudible]—what the NIE actually said. It said that, as far as the intelligence community could tell, at one time, the ians had a military—covert military program that was suspended in 2003 because of international pressure. My attitude is that a nontransparent country, a country which has yet to disclose what it was up to, could easily restart a program. The fact that they suspended the program is heartening in that the international community's response had worked. The fact that they had one is discouraging because they could restart it.Secondly, there are three aspects to a weapons program. One is the capacity to have—enrich so that you can have the materials necessary to make a bomb. They're claiming they're enriching for civilian purposes. I believe that knowledge gained for civilian purposes could be transferred for military purposes. Therefore, our efforts are to stop them from enriching.Secondly, the knowledge of how to convert any materials into a bomb—we don't know whether they have that knowledge or not. However, for the sake of peace, we ought to assume they do and, therefore, rally the world to convince others that they're a threat. Third, they've got missiles in which they can use to deliver the bomb. So no matter how you might have interpreted the NIE, I interpreted it to mean you better take the ians' threat seriously.Secondly, I have always told the American people that I believe it's incumbent upon the American Presidents to solve problems diplomatically. And that's exactly what we're in the process of doing. I believe that pressure—economic pressure, financial sanctions—will cause the people inside of to have to make a considered judgment about whether or not it makes sense for them to continue to enrich or face world isolation. The country is paying an economic price for its intransigence and its unwillingness to tell the truth.The ian people, we have no qualm with the ian people; I'm sure Israel doesn't either. It's people with a proud history and a great tradition. But they are being misled by their Government. The actions of their Government are causing there to be isolation and economic stagnation. People went into office saying, we promise you this, and we promise you this economic benefit, but they're simply not being delivered. And so we'll continue to keep the pressure on the ians, and I believe we can solve this problem diplomatically.[] We had a very thorough discussion, which, of course, also covered the ian subject, as President Bush said. And we discussed all aspects of this issue, and of course, it goes without saying that we shared with one another what we know and what we—what the Americans know when it comes to this topic. And without my sharing with you right now all of the details, of course, despite the natural curiosity, which I appreciate, I believe that what has just been said now by the President of the United States is particularly important. The President of the largest power in the world, the most important power in the world, is standing right here, and he has said in no uncertain terms that was a threat and remains a threat.And the fact that it has certain technological capacities is a fact. And through this, it is capable of realizing that potential and creating nuclear weapons. And considering the nature of the Government there and the type of threats that they are voicing, one cannot possibly disregard that power, and we must do everything possible to thwart them.Of course, the United States will decide for itself just what steps to take. I can only say one thing, namely, my impression based on this conversation as well as previous talks that we had—and we talk quite frequently, apart from the face-to-face meetings—my impression is that we have here a leader who is exceptionally determined, exceptionally loyal to the principles in which he believes. He has proven this throughout his term in office in his preparedness to take exceptional measures in order to defend the principles in which he believes and in his deep commitment to the security of the State of Israel.Inasmuch as I could sum up all of these impressions this evening, I would say that I certainly am encouraged and reinforced having heard the position of the United States under the leadership of George Bush, particularly on this subject.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking about a specific fear/concern in Israel: that the U.S. administration might be unwilling to take the “necessary action” against Iran because of the long‑running, unpopular Iraq war. The question seeks a direct response to that particular worry.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee’s reply discusses:
   - The content of the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) regarding Iran’s nuclear program.
   - Enrichment, weapons‑development knowledge, missile delivery, and the need for diplomatic pressure.
   - General statements about U.S. diplomatic efforts and economic sanctions.
   - No mention of Israel’s fear, the Iraq war, or any concern that U.S. hands are tied because of Iraq.

3. **Information type** – The requested information (the Israeli fear/concern about U.S. inaction due to Iraq) is **not provided**. The answer is unrelated to the question’s subject matter.

4. **Evasion / deflection** – The response completely sidesteps the question, offering unrelated content about intelligence assessments and policy approach rather than addressing the specific fear expressed.

And are you willing to speak to President Asad to end the crisis in Lebanon?,"No, it wasn't coordinated with me, and my patience ran out on President Asad a long time ago.

And so if he's listening, he doesn't need a phone call. He knows exactly what my position is.We are—our view on Lebanon—first of all, it's very important that Lebanon—Lebanon's democracy succeed.

And if they can't come to an agreement—I appreciate the sides trying to work on a common ground for a President, but if they can't come for agreement, then the world ought to say this: that the March 14th coalition can run their candidate and their Parliament; majority plus one ought to determine who the President is.

22,. What are the odds for a guest-worker provision?,Q. What are the odds for a guest-worker provision?,"Well, that's got to be an integral part of a comprehensive plan. When you're talking comprehensive immigration reform, one part of it is a guest-worker program, where people can come on a temporary basis to do jobs Americans are not doing. I've always felt like that would be an important aspect of securing the border. In other words, if somebody is not trying to sneak in in the first place, it makes—decreases the work load on our Border Patrol and lets the Border Patrol focus on drugs and guns and terrorists. But that's a—I appreciate you bringing that up. I should have remembered it.Listen, thank you all very much for your time. I appreciate your interest.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct assessment of the *likelihood* or *probability* that a guest‑worker provision will be adopted or succeed (“What are the odds…?”).

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee does not give any numerical or explicit probability. Instead, they:
   - Talk generally about guest‑worker programs being “an integral part of a comprehensive plan.”
   - Explain the *purpose* of such a program (temporary labor, border‑security benefits).
   - Shift to a broader discussion of immigration reform and thank the audience.

3. **Information provided** – The response mentions the *importance* of a guest‑worker provision but does **not** address the *odds* or any concrete likelihood. The answer is therefore **partial** and **implicit**, focusing on rationale rather than the requested assessment.

4. **Classification decision** –  
   - It is **not** a *Clear Reply* because the specific information (the odds) is not explicitly stated.  
   - It is **not** a *Clear Non‑Reply* because some relevant content about guest‑worker provisions is offered, albeit indirectly.  
   - It fits the *Ambivalent* category: the answer is **incomplete** and **partial**, providing related context while dodging the direct question about odds.

23,"Are you concerned that the fiscal pressures the United States is under at the moment may compromise its ability to sustain its plans for the region, including the initiatives announced today?","Q.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct answer to whether the speaker is worried that U.S. fiscal pressures could undermine America’s ability to fund its regional initiatives announced that day.

2. **What the answer does** –  
   * The response begins with a long discussion of Europe’s crisis, market turmoil, and the need for a stronger European response.  
   * It then shifts to talk about the speaker’s own budget priorities, job creation, and the importance of the Asia‑Pacific region.  
   * It never explicitly states whether the speaker is *concerned* that U.S. fiscal constraints might limit the ability to sustain those regional initiatives. The answer is therefore **not a direct, explicit answer** to the question.

3. **Nature of the response** –  
   * It provides **related but incomplete information**: it mentions “budget” and “spending this time out here in Asia,” but it does not address the core concern about fiscal pressures compromising regional plans.  
   * The reply **deflects** to other topics (Europe, Asia, job creation) rather than answering the specific query.  
   * Because the answer is **partial and indirect**, it fits the definition of an *ambivalent* response—information is given, but it is incomplete, implicit, and does not fully satisfy the request.

1. **What the question asks:**  
   The interviewer wants to know the specific “hook” – i.e., the lever or pressure point – that would persuade Hizballah to accept a cease‑fire, stop shooting, and cease kidnapping soldiers.

2. **What the answer provides:**  
   The interviewee explicitly states that the hook would be “international pressure on not only Hizballah … but also its sponsors.” This directly identifies the lever (international pressure on Hizballah and its backers) that would be used to achieve the desired behavior.

3. **Does the answer meet the “Clear Reply” criteria?**  
   - The requested information (the hook) is **explicitly stated**.  
   - It is given in the **requested form** – a clear description of the pressure point.  
   - There is no evasion, deflection, or vague/partial wording that leaves the core question unanswered.

25,What is the outlook in your view when you will be presenting your first report?,"Q. Good afternoon. This question is to the three leaders. The stock exchange mar-kets—the stock markets have gone through a severe crisis in recent weeks. How close are we to a stock exchange crash, and what measures have you taken so that it does not affect the real economy?So when you will be presenting your first report, there's an opposition party that wants to prevent this—what is the outlook in your view? What's the outlook? And do you trust—do you believe that the opposition will accept your invitation for a dialog?","Well, to answer the first question, there's the financial problem, which is quite delicate in several markets. What I can tell you in relation to the case of Mexico, fortunately, our financial system has been solid enough to resist these critical times. I know that many central banks in several parts of the world, the European Union, the Federal Reserve in the U.S., and other central banks, have applied considerable resources in order to bring liquidity to their financial and banking systems.Now, fortunately, in the case of Mexico, this has not been necessary. The financial system and the banking system is very solid. It took us a lot of work, a lot of money to have such a solid system that would resist situations like this, but fortunately, it has not required the support of liquidity from the Central Bank of Mexico.Currently, the Mexican Stock Exchange has adjusted fixed income values. This is the case throughout the world. However, the Mexican Stock Exchange was one of the five that actually had an increase in its value throughout the world last year, over 50 percent. And obviously, the reduction that we're seeing is somehow or another a form of a correction, which will actually improve the health of the financial markets in Mexico.Could it have an impact in the real economy? Well, that depends on the scope of the situation, how it affects the markets, particularly the North American markets, which affects us most. My belief is that the situation is beginning to stabilize. And it will depend on the impact that it might have on the growth of the U.S., which, as you know, Mexico depends on this growth, on the U.S. growth.Now, in relation to the second subject, the second issue, I have invited legislators. I'm a democrat that believes in the basic ideas and that believes in constructing dialog, and this is what I'm seeking in Congress, constructive dialog. Unfortunately, I still haven't received a positive answer from this—in relation to this invitation, but I believe, I trust that in the future, there will be greater willingness to talk about issues of concern for all Mexicans.I know it's another system, Canada is, but Prime Minister Harper has to talk to his Parliament just about every day, every week. And I think—I would say that we would—I would very much like to have an institutional way in Mexico so that we're able to work and to talk about what we agree with and what we don't agree with in our country. I'll be willing to talk to anybody that wants to talk to me, particularly within Congress.Now, in relation to the attitude of the PRD or other members of that party, I respect them, and of course, I appeal to the sense of responsibility towards the country. And I hope that maturity will prevail and common sense too. So the only thing that will be lost with this is that anybody that breaks the basic laws of our institutional life—let's say that citizens know very well and recognize the maturity and the responsibility of political parties, and the people of our country are able to punish these attitudes too. Our monetary and financial systems that monitor it are following it closely. But naturally, there are certain differences in their assets and liabilities, and some of the major corporations will have drops in their stocks. That is the normal course. But I can assure you that the capital situation of our major corporations, our financial institutions, of our individual persons are very strong.[.]Our economic and financial institutions that are responsible for watching these markets are monitoring them closely. At the same time, just to remind people, it's normal for the price of assets of various securities or companies or whatever to go up and down in the marketplace. It's not unusual. I can assure you that the position of Canadian financial sector, in particular our banks, Canadian companies in general, and the household sector, our capital positions are very strong. The fundamentals of the U.S. economy are strong. Inflation is down; interest rates are low; the employment picture is strong; exports are up. We grew at over 3 percent in the second quarter. The fundamental question is, is there enough liquidity in our system as people readjust risk? And the answer is, yes, there is.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

26,When are you going to tell the Israelis to stop destroying houses in Lebanon?,"Q. Mr. President, you spoke of having a plan to rebuild houses in Lebanon. Wouldn't the people of Lebanon rather know when you're going to tell the Israelis to stop destroying houses?And, Prime Minister, you've talked of having a plan today, but isn't the truth that you and the President believe that Israel is on the right side in the war on terror and you want them to win this war, not to stop it?","Look, we care deeply about the people whose lives have been affected in Lebanon, just like we care deeply about the people whose lives have been affected in Israel. There's over a million people in Israel that are threatened by this consistent rocket attack coming out of Lebanon. And, yes, we want to help people rebuild their lives, absolutely. But we also want to address the root causes of the problem, and the root cause of the problem is you've got Hizballah that is armed and willing to fire rockets into Israel—a Hizballah, by the way, that I firmly believe is backed by Iran and encouraged by Iran.And so for the sake of long-term stability, we've got to deal with this issue now. Listen, the temptation is to say, It's too tough. Let's just try to solve it quickly with something that won't last; let's just get it off the TV screens. But that won't solve the problem. And it's certainly not going to help the Lebanese citizens have a life that is normal and peaceful.What is necessary is to help the Siniora Government, and one way to help the Siniora Government is to make aid available to help rebuild the houses that were destroyed. Another way to help the Siniora Government is to implement 1559, which is the disarmament of armed militia inside his country.And I—look, we care deeply about the lives that have been affected on both sides of this issue, just like I care deeply about the innocent people who are being killed in Iraq and people being denied a state in the Palestinian Territory. But make no mistake about it, it is the goal and aims of the terrorist organizations to stop that type of advance. That's what they're trying to do. They're trying to evoke sympathy for themselves. They're not sympathetic people. They're violent, coldblooded killers who are trying to stop the advance of freedom.And this is the calling of the 21st century, it seems like to me, and now is the time to confront the problem. And of course, we're going to help the people in Lebanon rebuild their lives. But as Tony said, this conflict started, out of the blue, with two Israeli soldiers kidnaped and rockets being fired across the border.Now, we have urged restraint. We made it clear that we care about wanton destruction. On the other hand, in my judgment, it would be a big mistake not to solve the underlying problems. Otherwise, everything will seem fine, and then you'll be back at a press conference saying, How come you didn't solve the underlying problems? We feel deeply for people in Lebanon and people in Israel who are the innocent casualties of this conflict. Of course we do. And we want it to stop, and we want it to stop now. And what we're putting forward today is actually a practical plan that would lead to a U.N. resolution—could be early next week—that would allow it, put in place the conditions for it to stop.But what we've also got to do is to make sure that we recognize that this action wasn't simply aimed against Israel, and then Israel retaliated. It was also aimed against the proper Government of Lebanon being able to control its own country. And the very reason why, 2 years ago, the international community passed this resolution was because people could see that what was going to happen in southern Lebanon was that these Hizballah militias, that are armed and financed by Iran and by Syria, were going to move into the south of the country in order to be a focus of terrorism and discontent.Now, that is the fact. And of course, all of us are appalled at the destruction and loss of life; of course, we are. And that's why we've actually come together today with a viable plan—if people can agree it, as I believe they can—to get it stopped. But once you stop this violence happening now—which, of course, we should do—once you do, it doesn't alter the underlying reality unless we've got a framework that allows us to put the Government of Lebanon properly back in charge of its own country; unless we've got the commitment to take forward the Israel-Palestine two-state deal, which is there and which everyone wants to see; and then if we can—unless we mobilize the international community, to deal with the threat that Iran poses.And there's no other way out of this. We're not—we can, all of us, make whatever statements we want to do, use whatever words we want to do, but the brutal reality of the situation is that we're only going to get violence stopped and stability introduced on the basis of clear principles.Now, as I say, we've set out a way to do this. But it requires the long term, as well as the short term.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is demanding a concrete answer: *When will the speaker tell the Israelis to stop destroying houses in Lebanon?* The expected response would be a specific time frame or a clear statement of intent.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee talks broadly about caring for people on both sides, rebuilding houses, root causes, Hizballah, Iran, and the need to confront underlying problems. The response never provides a time, a commitment, or any direct answer to the “when” question. Instead, it deflects to general policy goals and avoids the specific query.

3. **Information type** – The answer is **incomplete** and **implicit**. It offers related themes (rebuilding, stability, addressing root causes) but does not answer the precise question about *when* Israel will be told to stop the house demolitions. It is a classic case of evasion/deflection.

4. **Evasion vs. non‑reply** – This is not a “Clear Non‑Reply” (which would be a refusal, ignorance, or inability to answer). The speaker does respond, but the response is deliberately vague and does not satisfy the request. Therefore it fits the “Ambivalent” category—information is given, but only partially and in a dodging manner.

**Conclusion**

The response is an incomplete, evasive answer that does not directly address the timing question.

It never mentions the supercommittee, nor does it say anything about “taking things with a grain of salt” or about waiting for the supercommittee’s conclusion. The answer completely sidesteps the specific query.

3. **Information provided** – No explicit answer is given. The speaker offers a general discussion of unrelated topics rather than addressing the question.

4. **Reason for non‑reply** – The omission is not due to lack of knowledge or a request for clarification; it is a deliberate deflection. The response is therefore incomplete and evasive.

5. **Classification decision** – Because the answer provides only a vague, indirect discussion and deliberately avoids the requested judgment, it fits the definition of an **Ambivalent** response: the information is given in an incomplete way, characterized by deflection rather than a clear reply or a straightforward non‑reply.

28,Why do you still say there is a relationship between them?,"Q. Mr. President, you have said throughout the war in Iraq and building up to the war in Iraq that there was a relationship between Saddam Hussein and Zarqawi and Al Qaida. A Senate Intelligence Committee report a few weeks ago said there was no link, no relationship, and that the CIA knew this and issued a report last fall. And yet a month ago, you were still saying there was a relationship. Why did you keep saying that? Why do you continue to say that? And do you still believe that?","The point I was making to Ken Herman's [Austin American-Statesman] question was that was a state sponsor of terror and that Mr. Zarqawi was in Iraq. He had been wounded in Afghanistan, had come to Iraq for treatment. He had ordered the killing of a U.S. citizen in Jordan. I never said there was an operational relationship. I was making the point that had been declared a state sponsor of terror for a reason, and therefore, he was dangerous.The broader point I was saying, I was reminding people was why we removed from power. He was dangerous. I would hope people aren't trying to rewrite the history of ; all of a sudden, he becomes kind of a benevolent fellow. He's a dangerous man. And one of the reasons he was declared a state sponsor of terror was because that's what he was. He harbored terrorists; he paid for families of suicide bombers. Never have I said that gave orders to attack 9/11. What I did say was, after 9/11, when you see a threat, you've got to take it seriously. And I saw a threat in , as did Congress, as did the .

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a justification for the speaker’s continued claim that there is a relationship between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda/Zarqawi, despite a Senate report saying otherwise.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The speaker directly answers the “why” by stating:
   - Saddam Hussein was a “state sponsor of terror.”
   - Zarqawi was present in Iraq, wounded in Afghanistan, sought treatment there, and had ordered attacks.
   - The speaker never claimed an *operational* relationship, only that the existence of a state sponsor of terror made the figure dangerous.
   - The broader point was that the danger justified removing Saddam from power.

   This provides explicit reasons for the continued assertion.

3. **Is the information explicit?** – Yes. The speaker spells out the rationale (“because he was a state sponsor of terror… he was dangerous”) rather than evading, deflecting, or leaving the question unanswered.

4. **Is the answer incomplete or ambiguous?** – While the response is broad, it is not vague about the core justification; it clearly explains the basis for the claim.

5. **Conclusion** – The response supplies a clear, explicit answer to the question “Why do you still say there is a relationship between them?” It meets the definition of a **Clear Reply**.

And part of our objective is to make sure that national security interests, security of the world interests, trump economic interests. And sometimes that takes a while to get people focused in the right direction.You know, the first step of a diplomatic solution is for there to be a common goal agreed upon by those of us participating in the process. The goal in is a nuclear weapons-free peninsula—not just in but North and South Korea. And that's an important goal. It's important for the neighborhood to have embraced that goal.The goal for Iran is for them to have a—verifiably get rid of their weapons program.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct prediction or assessment: *Will the G‑8 summit serve as a springboard to bring the Iran‑EU incentives issue to the UN Security Council if Iran does not give a definitive answer?* The answer should state whether the speaker foresees that outcome.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The speaker:
   - Declares the question is “hypothetical” and refuses to answer it.
   - Then shifts to a general statement that the G‑8 “will be an opportunity … to make it clear to the Iranians that we’re firm in our resolve.”
   - Provides unrelated remarks about talks with President Putin, sanctions, economic interests, and diplomatic goals.
   - Does **not** explicitly say whether the G‑8 will be used as a springboard to bring the issue to the UN Security Council.

30, New Policy on Intercepting North Korean Ships,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Since it's such a pleasant day, I was hoping you'd consent to let me ask two questions. The first one, on reports that there's a new policy on intercepting North Korean ships at sea, if you could say anything about that. And are you concerned that that could provoke North Korea to new levels, higher levels of hostility?","Well, this is not simply a U.S. policy; this is a international policy. This was part of what the Security Council resolution calls for, is the interdiction of arms shipments. How that's going to be implemented, how we approach cooperation between various countries to enforce this, is something that the United States, South Korea, China, Russia, all relevant actors--Japan--all relevant actors will be discussing in the months to come.But I want to emphasize something that President Lee said. There's been a pattern in the past where behaves in a belligerent fashion, and if it waits long enough, is then rewarded with foodstuffs and fuel and concessionary loans and a whole range of benefits. And I think that's the pattern that they've come to expect.The message we're sending--and when I say we, not simply the United States and the Republic of Korea, but I think the international community--is we are going to break that pattern. We are more than willing to engage in negotiations to get on a path of peaceful coexistence with its neighbors, and we want to encourage their prosperity. But belligerent, provocative behavior that threatens neighbors will be met with significant, serious enforcement of sanctions that are in place.And I think it may not have been fully acknowledged the degree to which we have seen much tougher sanctions voted out unanimously, in fairly rapid order, over the last several weeks. And I expect that that signals the degree to which we're serious about enforcement.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a description of the newly reported policy concerning the interception of North Korean ships at sea, and whether it might provoke greater hostility.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee:
   - Explicitly states that the policy is “not simply a U.S. policy; this is an international policy” and that it “was part of what the Security Council resolution calls for, is the interdiction of arms shipments.”
   - Describes the implementation process (“how we approach cooperation between various countries… will be discussed in the months to come”) and lists the relevant actors (U.S., South Korea, China, Russia, Japan).
   - Explains the strategic purpose: breaking a pattern of belligerent behavior, preventing rewards for provocation, and enforcing sanctions.
   - Provides concrete details about the sanctions and the seriousness of enforcement.

3. **Information type** – The response supplies clear, explicit information about the policy: its legal basis (Security Council resolution), its scope (interdiction of arms shipments), the multilateral discussion process, and the intended enforcement stance. It directly answers the question rather than deflecting or remaining vague.

4. **Evasion or incompleteness?** – There is no evasion or incomplete answer; the interviewee fully explains the policy and its implications.

31,How do you measure progress with a body count like that?,Q. But how do you measure progress with a body count like that?,"Well, one way you do it is you measure progress based upon the resilience of the Iraqi people: Do they want there to be a unity government, or are they splitting up into factions of people warring with the head leaders, with different alternatives of governing styles and different philosophies? The unity Government is intact. It's working forward. They're making tough decisions, and we'll stay with them. We'll stay with them because success in Iraq is important for this country. We're constantly changing our tactics. We're constantly adapting to the enemy. We're constantly saying, Here's the way forward; we want to work with you. But this is really the big challenge of the 21st century, whether or not this country and allies are willing to stand with moderate people in order to fight off extremists. It is the challenge.I said the other night in a speech, this is like the ideological war of the 21st century, and I believe it. And I believe that if we leave that region, if we don't help democracy prevail, then our children and grandchildren will be faced with an unbelievable chaotic and dangerous situation in the Middle East. Imagine an enemy that can't stand what we believe in getting a hold of oil resources and taking a bunch of oil off the market in order to have an economic punishment. In other words, they say, You go ahead and do this, and if you don't, we'll punish you economically. Or imagine a Middle East with an Iran with a nuclear weapon threatening free nations and trying to promote their vision of extremism through Hizballah.I find it interesting that young democracies are being challenged by extremists. I also take great hope in the fact that, by far, the vast majority of people want normalcy and want peace, including in Iraq; that there is a deep desire for people to raise their children in a peaceful world; the desire for mothers to have the best for their child. And it's not—this isn't— you know, Americans—you've got to understand, this is universal. And the idea of just saying, well, that's not important for us—to me—or the future of the country, it's just not acceptable.And I know it's tough in Iraq. Of course it's tough in Iraq, because an enemy is trying to stop this new democracy, just like people are trying to stop the development of a Palestinian state, which I strongly support, or people trying to undermine the Lebanese democracy. And the reason why is because the ideologues understand that liberty will trump their dark vision of the world every time. And that's why I call it an ideological struggle. And it's a necessary struggle, and it's a vital struggle.Richard [Richard Benedetto, USA Today].",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct explanation of *how* progress is measured when “a body count” is used as a metric.

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee does not give a concise, explicit formula or method for measuring progress. Instead, they shift to a broader discussion of:
   - Measuring progress by the *resilience* of the Iraqi people,
   - The stability of a *unity government*,
   - Adapting tactics, supporting moderate forces, and the larger ideological struggle.

   The response touches on measuring progress indirectly, but it remains vague, general, and interwoven with unrelated commentary.

3. **Information type** – The answer provides *partial* and *implicit* information about a way to gauge progress, but it does not directly answer the specific question in the form requested. It is neither a complete refusal nor a precise statement; it is an incomplete, somewhat evasive elaboration.

4. **Evasion vs. clarity** – Because the response does address the topic (measuring progress) but does so in a roundabout, generalized manner, it falls into the category of an *ambivalent* reply—information is given, yet it is incomplete and indirect.

33,What do you say to people who say more troops in Iraq would increase the sectarian split and not calm things down?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You have reached out to both Sunni and Shi'a political leaders in recent weeks, and now there's word that the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani is supporting a moderate coalition in Iraq. Has the U.S. reached out to him? How important is he in the equation moving forward? And what do you say to people who say more troops in Iraq would increase the sectarian split and not calm things down?","Well, I haven't made up my mind yet about more troops. I'm listening to our commanders; I'm listening to the Joint Chiefs, of course; I'm listening to people in and out of Government; I'm listening to the folks on the Baker-Hamilton commission about coming up with a strategy that helps us achieve our objective. And so as I said to Caren—probably a little more harshly than she would have liked—hypothetical questions, I'm not going to answer them today. I'm not going to speculate out loud about what I'm going to tell the Nation, when I'm prepared to do so, about the way forward.I will tell you we're looking at all options. And one of those options, of course, is increasing more troops. But in order to do so, there must be a specific mission that can be accomplished with more troops. And that's precisely what our commanders have said, as well as people who know a lot about military operations. And I agree with them that there's got to be a specific mission that can be accomplished with the addition of more troops before I agree on that strategy.Secondly, whatever we do is going to help the Iraqis step up. It's their responsibility to govern their country. It's their responsibility to do the hard work necessary to secure Baghdad. And we want to help them.Thirdly, I appreciate the fact that the Prime Minister and members of the Government are forming what you have called a moderate coalition, because it's becoming very apparent to the people of Iraq that there are extremists and radicals who are anxious to stop the advance of a free society. And therefore, a moderate coalition signals to the vast majority of the people of Iraq that we have a unity government, that we're willing to reconcile our differences and work together and, in so doing, will marginalize those who use violence to achieve political objectives.And so we support the formation of the unity Government and the moderate coalition. And it's important for the leader Sistani to understand that's our position. He is a—he lives a secluded life, but he knows that we're interested in defeating extremism, and we're interested in helping advance a unity government.Kelly [Kelly O'Donnell, NBC News].",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct response to the criticism that “adding more troops in Iraq would worsen the sectarian split rather than calm things down.” The expected answer would address that specific claim, e.g., explain why the administration believes more troops would not exacerbate sectarianism or how it plans to mitigate that risk.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not directly confront the allegation. Instead, the response:
   - Shifts to a general discussion of “more troops” as one of many “options.”
   - Emphasizes that any decision must be based on a “specific mission” that can be achieved.
   - Mentions listening to commanders, the Joint Chiefs, and the Baker‑Hamilton commission.
   - Briefly notes that a “moderate coalition” and the role of Grand Ayatollah Sistani are important, but never explicitly says what the administration would tell critics who argue that more troops would increase sectarian division.

3. **Information provided** – The answer is **partial and implicit**. It touches on the broader context of troop decisions and the need for a clear mission, but it stops short of directly answering the specific criticism about sectarian split. The core claim is left unexplained; the speaker deflects with “I’m not going to answer hypothetical questions” and only offers a vague condition‑based stance on troop increases.

4. **Evasion or deflection?** – Yes. The response largely avoids the substantive rebuttal of the sectarian‑split argument and instead offers a generic statement about “options” and “specific missions.” This fits the description of a **dodging/deflection** answer.

5. **Classification decision** – Because the answer is **incomplete and indirect**—it does not clearly state the administration’s position on the claim that more troops would exacerbate sectarian tension—it falls into the **Ambivalent** category rather than a clear reply or a total non‑reply.

I guess my question is, are you still willing to follow a path that seems to be in opposition to the will of the American people?","I am willing to follow a path that leads to victory, and that's exactly why we're conducting the review we are. Victory in Iraq is achievable. It hasn't happened nearly as quickly as I hoped it would have. I know it's—the fact that there is still unspeakable sectarian violence in Iraq, I know that's troubling to the American people. But I also don't believe most Americans want us just to get out now. A lot of Americans understand the consequences of retreat. Retreat would embolden radicals. It would hurt the credibility of the United States. Retreat from Iraq would dash the hopes of millions who want to be free. Retreat from Iraq would enable the extremists and radicals to more likely be able to have safe haven from which to plot and plan further attacks.And so it's been a tough period for the American people. They want to see success, and our objective is to put a plan in place that achieves that success. I'm often asked about public opinion. Of course, I want public opinion to support the efforts.

35,How much of a political price do you think you're paying for that right now?,"Q. Thanks. Mr. President, what do you say to people who are losing patience with gas prices at $3 a gallon? And how much of a political price do you think you're paying for that right now?","I've been talking about gas prices ever since they got high, starting with this—look, I understand gas prices are like a hidden tax—not a hidden tax, it's a tax; it's taking money out of people's pockets. I know that. All the more reason for us to diversify away from crude oil. That's not going to happen overnight. We passed law that encouraged consumption through different purchasing habits, like hybrid vehicles. You buy a hybrid, you get a tax credit. We've encouraged the spread of ethanol as an alternative to crude oil. We have asked for Congress to pass regulatory relief so we can build more refineries to increase the supply of gasoline, hopefully taking the pressure off of price.And so the strategy is to recognize that dependency upon crude oil is—in a global market affects us economically here at home, and therefore, we need to diversify away as quickly as possible.Jackson.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step reasoning**

1. **What the question asks:**  
   The interviewer wants a direct assessment of the political cost the speaker believes they are incurring because of high gas prices (“how much of a political price do you think you're paying for that right now?”).

2. **What the answer provides:**  
   - The response talks about gas prices being a “hidden tax,” diversification away from crude oil, tax credits for hybrids, ethanol, regulatory relief for refineries, etc.  
   - It never states *how much* political price is being paid, nor does it give a clear estimate, admission, or denial.  
   - Instead, it shifts the focus to policy measures and broader economic strategy, effectively avoiding the specific question about political cost.

3. **Evaluation against the categories:**  
   - **Clear Reply:** The answer does **not** explicitly state the requested information (the amount of political price).  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply:** The speaker does not refuse to answer outright; they do attempt to respond, but the response is unrelated and evasive.  
   - **Ambivalent:** The answer is **incomplete** and **deflective**—it offers related but not directly answering information, leaving the core question unanswered. This matches the definition of an ambivalent response (partial, implicit, dodging, or deflection).

**Conclusion:** The response is an incomplete, indirect deflection that fails to give a clear answer to the question about the political price being paid.

**LABEL:** Ambivalent","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to the specific question: ""How much of a political price do you think you\'re paying for that right now?""

The categories: Clear Reply = explicitly stated; Clear Non-Reply = not given at all due to ignorance, need for clarification, or declining to answer; Ambivalent = incomplete way (too general, partial, implicit, dodging, deflection).

36,Is it no longer important to track him down?,"Q. We suspected as much, sir. [Laughter] But the question I have is, it appears that the CIA has disbanded the unit that was hunting him down. Is it no longer important to track him down?","It's just an incorrect story. I mean, we got a lot of assets looking for . So whatever you want to read in that story, it's just not true, period.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct assessment of whether it is *no longer important* to track the person down. In other words, they are asking for a clear answer to the proposition “Is tracking him down no longer important?”

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not give a simple “yes” or “no.”  
   - Instead, they say the story that the CIA has disbanded the unit is “incorrect.”  
   - They add that “we got a lot of assets looking for …” (implying that tracking him is still a priority).  
   - They conclude that “whatever you want to read in that story, it’s just not true, period.”

3. **Is the requested information explicitly stated?** – Yes. The speaker explicitly rejects the premise that tracking him down is no longer important and asserts that there are still assets devoted to that effort. This is a direct, unambiguous denial of the claim and therefore provides the information asked for, even though it is phrased as a rebuttal rather than a plain “no.”

4. **Is it a non‑reply or ambivalent?** – No. The answer does not evade the question by refusing to comment, nor does it give only a vague or partial response. It directly confronts the allegation and states the opposite of the suggested premise.

**Conclusion:** The response supplies an explicit answer to the question by refuting the claim and indicating that tracking him down remains important.

**LABEL: Clear Reply**","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to the question: ""Is it no longer important to track him down?""

The question asks: Is it no longer important to track him down? They respond that it\'s an incorrect story, that there are assets looking for (presumably him), and that whatever you read is not true. They are denying the premise that the CIA disbanded the unit, and implying that tracking him down is still important (they have assets looking for him). They do not directly answer ""Is it no longer important?"" but they effectively say it\'s not true that it\'s no longer important; they assert that there are assets looking for him, implying it\'s still a priority. However, they do not explicitly answer the yes/no question; they deflect with ""It\'s just an incorrect story"" and ""it\'s just not true"". That is a clear denial of the premise, but does it answer the question? The question asks if it\'s no longer important; they say it\'s an incorrect story, implying that it\'s still important. They do not explicitly say ""No, it is still important"" but they deny the claim that it\'s no longer important. That could be considered a clear reply? The categories: Clear Reply - information explicitly stated in requested form. Here they are giving a statement that indirectly answers: they say it\'s not true that it\'s no longer important; they assert there are assets looking for him. That is explicit enough? It\'s a direct denial of the claim, but the question expects a yes/no or assessment of importance. They provide a clear statement that it\'s not true that it\'s no longer important; they imply it\'s still important. That seems like a clear reply, albeit not a direct yes/no but an explicit statement that the story is incorrect. I\'d classify as Clear Reply because they explicitly address the claim and deny it, providing the needed information.\n\nBut could be Ambivalent? It\'s somewhat vague: ""It\'s just an incorrect story... we got a lot of assets looking for . So whatever you want to read in that story, it\'s just not true, period."" They don\'t directly answer ""Is it no longer important?"" but they refute the premise. The classification definitions: Clear Reply - information requested is explicitly stated (in the requested form). The requested form is a yes/no or assessment of importance. They didn\'t state ""No, it is still important."" They said it\'s an incorrect story. That\'s a direct rebuttal but not a direct answer. I\'d lean to Ambivalent? However, they do explicitly state that the story is incorrect, which answers the question: it\'s not no longer important; it\'s still important. That is explicit enough? I\'d say it\'s a Clear Reply because they explicitly refute the claim and assert that there are assets looking for him, indicating continued importance. It\'s not vague; it\'s a direct denial.\n\nThus classification: Clear Reply.\n'}]",Clear Reply
37,New instructions for Secretary Rice's visit to the region,"Q. Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, with support apparently growing among the Arab population, both Shi'a and Sunni, for Hizballah by bounds, is there a risk that every day that goes by without a cease-fire will tip this conflict into a wider war?And, Mr. President, when Secretary Rice goes back to the region, will she have any new instructions, such as meeting with Syrians?","Her instructions are to work with Israel and Lebanon to get a— to come up with an acceptable U.N. Security Council resolution that we can table next week. And secondly, it's really important for people to understand that terrorists are trying to stop the advance of freedom, and therefore, it's essential that we do what's right and not necessarily what appears to be immediately popular.There's a lot of suffering in Lebanon because Hizballah attacked Israel. There's a lot of suffering in the Palestinian Territory because militant Hamas is trying to stop the advance of democracy. There is suffering in Iraq because terrorists are trying to spread sectarian violence and stop the spread of democracy. And now is the time for the free world to work to create the conditions so that people everywhere can have hope.And those are the stakes; that's what we face right now. We've got a plan to deal with this immediate crisis. It's one of the reasons the Prime Minister came, to talk about that plan. But the stakes are larger than just Lebanon.Isn't it interesting, that when Prime Minister Olmert starts to reach out to President Abbas to develop a Palestinian state, militant Hamas creates the conditions so that there's crisis, and then Hizballah follows up? Isn't it interesting, as a democracy takes hold in Iraq, that Al Qaida steps up its efforts to murder and bomb in order to stop the democracy?And so one of the things that the people in the Middle East must understand is that we're working to create the conditions of hope and opportunity for all of them. And we'll continue to do that, Tom. That's— this is the challenge of the 21st century. It's very obvious what the strategy of terrorism is, and of the actions that Hizballah took. Their strategy is to commit an outrage that provokes a reaction and then on the back of the reaction, to mobilize extreme elements and then try and create a situation which even moderate people feel drawn to their cause. That's the strategy.And you, quite rightly, say, Well, isn't there a danger that the Arab street and people in Arab Muslim countries become more sympathetic to Hizballah as a result of what's happened? That is their strategy. How do we counter it? We counter it, one, by having our own strategy to bring the immediate crisis to an end, which we do. That is what is important about the Secretary of State visiting the region, getting an agreement, tabling it to the United Nations, getting the endorsement of the United Nations, having an international stabilization force to move into the situation. We've got to deal with the immediate situation.But then, as the President was saying a moment or two ago, we've then got to realize what has happened in the past few weeks is not an isolated incident. It is part of a bigger picture. Now, I'm going to say some more things about this in the days to come, but we really will never understand how we deal with this situation unless we understand that there is a big picture out in the Middle East which is about reactionary and terrorist groups trying to stop what the vast majority of people in the Middle East want, which is progress towards democracy, liberty, human rights, the same as the rest of us.Now, that's the battle that's going on. And, yes, it is always very difficult when something like this happens, as it has happened over the past few weeks. So we've got to resolve the immediate situation, but we shouldn't be in any doubt at all, that will be a temporary respite unless we put in place the longer-term framework.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants to know whether Secretary Rice will receive *new* instructions on her upcoming trip, specifically whether those instructions include something like a meeting with Syrian officials.

2. **What the answer provides** –  
   - The respondent does state that “Her instructions are to work with Israel and Lebanon to get an acceptable U.N. Security Council resolution…”.  
   - However, the answer never explicitly says whether there are *new* instructions, nor does it address the specific possibility of a meeting with Syrians.  
   - The bulk of the response then veers into a broader political narrative about terrorism, suffering, and strategy, which, while related to the Middle‑East context, does not directly answer the question about Rice’s instructions.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – The answer does **not** explicitly state the requested information (i.e., “new instructions such as meeting with Syrians”).  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – The answer does give some related information (the stated instructions to work with Israel and Lebanon), so it is not a complete non‑reply.

38,What message do you hope this summit sends to Senator Jon Kyl and other Republicans in the Senate who are resisting voting on and ratifying START in the lame duck session?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. What message do you hope this summit sends to Senator Jon Kyl and other Republicans in the Senate who are resisting voting on and ratifying START in the lame duck session?","Well, a couple of messages that I just want to send to the American people. Number one, I think that Americans should be proud that an alliance that began 60 years ago, through the extraordinary sacrifices, in part, of American young men and women, sustained throughout a cold war, has resulted in a Europe that's more unified than it's ever been before, that is an extraordinarily strong ally of the United States, and that continues to be a cornerstone of prosperity not just for the United States and Europe but for the world. This is a direct result of American efforts and American sacrifice. And I think the world appreciates it.The second message I want to send is that after a period in which relations between the United States and Europe were severely strained, that strain no longer exists. There are occasions where there may be disagreements on certain tactical issues, but in terms of a broad vision of how we achieve transatlantic security that alliance has never been stronger. And that's something that Americans should feel good about.Number three, I think the Americans should know that American leadership remains absolutely critical to achieving some of these important security objectives. And I think our European partners would be the first to acknowledge that.What we ratified here today is the direct result of work that we've done over the last 2 years to get to this point. And just to take the example of Afghanistan. I think that if you said even a year ago, or even maybe 6 months ago that we would have a unified approach on the part of our allies to move forward in Afghanistan with a sustained commitment where we actually increased the resources available and closed the training gap in order to be successful, I think a lot of skeptics would have said that's not going to happen. It has happened, in part because we have rebuilt those strong bonds of trust between the United States and our allies.The fourth thing--and this finally goes to your specific question--unprompted, I have received overwhelming support from our allies here that START, the new START Treaty, is a critical component to U.S. and European security. And they have urged both privately and publicly that this gets done.And I think you've seen the comments of a wide range of European partners on this issue, including those who live right next to Russia, who used to live behind the Iron Curtain, who have the most cause for concern with respect to Russian intentions and who have uniformly said that they will feel safer and more secure if this treaty gets ratified--in part, because right now we have no verification mechanism on the ground with respect to Russian arsenals. And Ronald Reagan said, Trust, but verify. We can't verify right now.In part because, as a consequence of the reset between the United States and Russia, we have received enormous help from the Russians in instituting sanctions on Iran that are tougher than anything we've seen before. We have transit agreements with Russia that allows us to supply our troops. There are a whole range of security interests in which we are cooperating with Russia, and it would be a profound mistake for us to slip back into mistrust as a consequence of our failure to ratify.And the third reason is that with the cold war over, it is in everybody's interests to work on reducing our nuclear arsenals, which are hugely expensive and contain the possibilities of great damage, if not in terms of direct nuclear war, then in terms of issues of nuclear proliferation.So we've got our European allies saying this is important. We've got the U.S. military saying this is important. We've got the National Security Advisers and the Secretaries of Defense and generals from the Reagan administration, the Bush administration--Bush I and Bush II--as well as from the Clinton administration and my administration saying this is important to our national security. We've got the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee saying this is in our national interest to get done now. This is an issue that traditionally has received strong bipartisan support. We've gone through 18 hearings; we've answered 1,000 questions. We have met the concerns about modernizing our nuclear stockpile with concrete budget numbers.It's time for us to go ahead and get it done. And my hope is that we will do so.There's no other reason not to do it than the fact that Washington has become a very partisan place. And this is a classic area where we have to rise above partisanship. Nobody is going to score points in the 2012 election around this issue, but it's something that we should be doing because it helps keep America safe. And my expectation is, is that my Republican friends in the Senate will ultimately conclude that it makes sense for us to do this.All right, Karen DeYoung [Washington Post]. There's a mike coming, Karen.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a clear, targeted statement about the *specific message* the speaker hopes the summit will convey to Senator Jon Kyl and other Republican hold‑outs on the START treaty.

2. **How the answer responds** –  
   - The speaker launches into a broad set of “messages to the American people” about the U.S.–Europe alliance, historical sacrifice, and transatlantic security.  
   - Only later does the answer mention START and note that allies have urged its ratification.  
   - The response never isolates a *single, explicit* message aimed at Kyl or the Republican obstruction; it remains general, lists several unrelated messages, and ends abruptly.

3. **Information provided** – Some relevant content is present (allies support START), but the answer is **partial, implicit, and diffuse**. It does not directly answer the question’s request for a concise, targeted message to the specified audience.

4. **Evasion or deflection?** – The speaker shifts the focus to wider themes rather than delivering a clear, targeted communication to Kyl and Senate Republicans. This is a classic case of **dodging/deflection**.

5. **Classification decision** – Because the response gives **incomplete, indirect, and partially relevant information** rather than a full, explicit answer, it fits the **Ambivalent** category.

39,"Role of China in Africa's development and its positive aspects, areas of improvement, and stance on human rights issues and corruption.","Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to ask both you leaders about the increasing role of China in Africa's development. What do you think is positive about its role in aid and commerce, and what do you think it could be doing a better job with? In particular, do you think it's ignoring human rights issues and corruption?","Well, I might let John start. He's, after all, been engaged with leaders. I have an opinion, but we'll let him start. I believe we should all agree, for starters, that the world is opening up and opening up fast. Values are becoming uniform, and the—our multinational efforts agenda, openness and competitiveness and all-inclusiveness. Now is spreading out, and it's here in Africa and in Ghana too. It's coming not as a colonial power, as far as we can see; it's coming, if I may put it, as a guest and, I believe, on our terms, on the terms of the African nations.And I can assure you, our nations are not succumbing to dictates and impositions, not from nor elsewhere. If it's something that Africa wants to buy and it can find it economical, then whatever it is, that's where Africa will buy it from. And is proving quite competitive. So how do we stop ? We can't stop . We are relating, and we want to relate on common values. We believe that's what, again, globalization should be all about. We are in the United Nations with . We talk World Trade Organization, and I believe is finding its way into that. Yes. We want peace around the world. How do we have peace if we do not engage each other peacefully in trade, in common dialogue, and in other respects? So this is . As to it being useful, and I would say, so far, so good. And I believe Africa is showing awareness because Africa came out of colonialism not too long ago. Ghana, for instance—the first country south of the Sahara to have gained independence—gained independence only 50 years ago. And I don't think the memory is lost to Africa.So whatever friendships we are engaging in now, we try as hard as possible to turn our new partners around. We try to see if we are engaging on our best terms so we maximize returns for us. Of course, we also care about our partners feeling that they haven't come in here to be shortchanged. There should be mutual advantage to all of us, and this is how we are engaging with . So as far as we are concerned, so far, it's all right with .Human rights, well, this would call for knowledge of what obtains in . I don't pretend that we are too informed of what happens inside , but we believe that in due course, whatever the situation is, there will be a tendency towards liberalization. Before, the relationship with was government to government; now it's getting to be people to people. It seems all of us are coming under the influences of the information and communications technology.So our views are becoming the same. People are beginning to speak for themselves everywhere and standing for their rights. I believe even in this will come to prevail in due course. And on this basis, I don't think it would be right for people to ostracize. Rather, we should find ways and means to engage with each other so it becomes a more understanding world for all of us. Thank you. I don't view Africa as zero sum for and the United States. I mean, I think their—we can pursue agendas that—without creating a great sense of competition. Inherent in your question is that I view as a fierce competitor on the continent of Africa—no, I don't.I view—first of all, I just will tell you that our policy is aimed at helping people. Trade helps people. I mean, one reason I'm committed to trying to get the Doha round complete is because the benefits of trade will far exceed monies given. I believe that it's in our Nation's interests— like, I noticed on the seal of the country it says, freedom and justice. There's nothing that promotes justice more than good education.Now, I do think that it's in the leaders' interests to have some high standards; like, for example, I presume that countries are saying that if you bring your capital, make sure that you employ African workers. I know some of the leaders I've talked to have said that one of the things we're going to do is make sure that our environment is protected, our trees are protected; that we're not going to allow ourselves to become exploited; that we, in fact, want to have relations with different countries, including , but there is—there will be some high standards. And that's the way it should be, high standards for every country. And the United States, of course, is willing to live with those standards. We believe in those standards.And so one thing that I hope that we're getting, that we all can do better, is to encourage value-added processing. And one of the things that has been lacking in Africa's past is for the people to really, truly realize the benefits of the resources at home, because those resources are just dug out of the ground or grown and just shipped overseas, when, in fact, if there could be facilities that take advantage of those resources, it will create more employment for people. And I know that John is concerned about that.And my only point is, there ought to be—you know, these countries ought to set standards and expect countries to live by them. And there's plenty of leaders who are willing to do that.Anyway, thank you very much, Mr. President. It's been a joyful experience here in the press conference. Thank you, Mr. President, for coming. Yes, sir. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

   - He declares he is “absolutely convinced Secretary Gates knows that removing Saddam was the right thing.”
   - He adds, “I’ve got a lot of trust in the man… He’s doing a fine job,” which conveys that the column’s content **does not change** his view.
   - Thus, the answer explicitly addresses the *potential impact* on the President’s viewpoint by asserting that it will not alter his stance.

3. **Information type** – The requested information (the impact on the President’s viewpoint) is given **explicitly**: the President says the situation “doesn’t change my mind” and that he has full confidence in Gates.

4. **Evasion or deflection?** – No meaningful evasion occurs; the answer directly answers the question about impact.

**Conclusion:** The response provides a clear, explicit answer to the question about the potential impact on the President’s viewpoint.

41,"Did Prime Minister Olmert present positions to Mr. Bush that contradict those of the Americans, and is there concern that his recent statement suggests his hands are tied when it comes to Iran?","Q. [Inaudible]—Israel's finding about Iran are completely different than the NIE report. Given the duration and the unpopularity of the war in Iraq, there is a fear, a concern in Israel that your administration will not take the necessary action against Iran.[At this point, the reporter asked a question in Hebrew, which was translated by an interpreter as follows.]And the question to Prime Minister Olmert: Did you perhaps present to Mr. Bush positions that run counter to those of the Americans, and perhaps you are concerned that what he said now actually indicates that his hands are tied when it comes to Iran?","[Inaudible]—what the NIE actually said. It said that, as far as the intelligence community could tell, at one time, the ians had a military—covert military program that was suspended in 2003 because of international pressure. My attitude is that a nontransparent country, a country which has yet to disclose what it was up to, could easily restart a program. The fact that they suspended the program is heartening in that the international community's response had worked. The fact that they had one is discouraging because they could restart it.Secondly, there are three aspects to a weapons program. One is the capacity to have—enrich so that you can have the materials necessary to make a bomb. They're claiming they're enriching for civilian purposes. I believe that knowledge gained for civilian purposes could be transferred for military purposes. Therefore, our efforts are to stop them from enriching.Secondly, the knowledge of how to convert any materials into a bomb—we don't know whether they have that knowledge or not. However, for the sake of peace, we ought to assume they do and, therefore, rally the world to convince others that they're a threat. Third, they've got missiles in which they can use to deliver the bomb. So no matter how you might have interpreted the NIE, I interpreted it to mean you better take the ians' threat seriously.Secondly, I have always told the American people that I believe it's incumbent upon the American Presidents to solve problems diplomatically. And that's exactly what we're in the process of doing. I believe that pressure—economic pressure, financial sanctions—will cause the people inside of to have to make a considered judgment about whether or not it makes sense for them to continue to enrich or face world isolation. The country is paying an economic price for its intransigence and its unwillingness to tell the truth.The ian people, we have no qualm with the ian people; I'm sure Israel doesn't either. It's people with a proud history and a great tradition. But they are being misled by their Government. The actions of their Government are causing there to be isolation and economic stagnation. People went into office saying, we promise you this, and we promise you this economic benefit, but they're simply not being delivered. And so we'll continue to keep the pressure on the ians, and I believe we can solve this problem diplomatically.[] We had a very thorough discussion, which, of course, also covered the ian subject, as President Bush said. And we discussed all aspects of this issue, and of course, it goes without saying that we shared with one another what we know and what we—what the Americans know when it comes to this topic. And without my sharing with you right now all of the details, of course, despite the natural curiosity, which I appreciate, I believe that what has just been said now by the President of the United States is particularly important. The President of the largest power in the world, the most important power in the world, is standing right here, and he has said in no uncertain terms that was a threat and remains a threat.And the fact that it has certain technological capacities is a fact. And through this, it is capable of realizing that potential and creating nuclear weapons. And considering the nature of the Government there and the type of threats that they are voicing, one cannot possibly disregard that power, and we must do everything possible to thwart them.Of course, the United States will decide for itself just what steps to take. I can only say one thing, namely, my impression based on this conversation as well as previous talks that we had—and we talk quite frequently, apart from the face-to-face meetings—my impression is that we have here a leader who is exceptionally determined, exceptionally loyal to the principles in which he believes. He has proven this throughout his term in office in his preparedness to take exceptional measures in order to defend the principles in which he believes and in his deep commitment to the security of the State of Israel.Inasmuch as I could sum up all of these impressions this evening, I would say that I certainly am encouraged and reinforced having heard the position of the United States under the leadership of George Bush, particularly on this subject. Anne Gearan of the Associated Press, please.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct assessment of two matters:  
   a) Whether Prime Minister Olmert conveyed to President Bush positions that run counter to U.S. positions, and  
   b) Whether his recent statement signals that “his hands are tied” regarding Iran.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response talks at length about:  
   - The content of the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iran,  
   - Iran’s alleged covert military program and enrichment activities,  
   - The need for diplomatic pressure and sanctions, and  
   - General statements about Israel‑U.S. relations.  

   It never explicitly states whether Olmert’s positions conflicted with those of the United States, nor does it comment on any “hands‑tied” implication of Olmert’s recent remarks. The answer is tangential, offering related but not responsive information.

3. **Information type** – The reply is **partial and indirect**. It provides some discussion of Iran‑related policy but does not answer the specific query about Olmert’s presentation to Bush or the concern over his “tied‑hands” stance. The response is therefore incomplete and evasive rather than a straightforward denial or affirmation.

4. **Evasion vs. non‑reply** – The interviewee does not refuse to answer outright (which would be a *Clear Non‑Reply*). Instead, they give a vague, off‑topic discourse that only loosely touches on the subject. This matches the definition of an **Ambivalent** response: the requested information is presented in an incomplete, implicit, or deflecting manner.

**Conclusion**

The response is an **Ambivalent** answer to the question.

**LABEL: Ambivalent**","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to that specific question. The question: ""Did Prime Minister Olmert present positions to Mr. Bush that contradict those of the Americans, and is there concern that his recent statement suggests his hands are tied when it comes to Iran?"" The answer is a long, somewhat incoherent response about NIE, Iran, enrichment, etc. It does not directly answer the question about Olmert presenting contradictory positions or concern about his hands being tied. It talks about Iran intelligence, enrichment, diplomatic pressure, etc. It does not address Olmert\'s actions or concerns about his hands being tied. So it\'s not a clear reply.

42,Do you and the President believe that Israel is on the right side in the war on terror?,"Q. Mr. President, you spoke of having a plan to rebuild houses in Lebanon. Wouldn't the people of Lebanon rather know when you're going to tell the Israelis to stop destroying houses?And, Prime Minister, you've talked of having a plan today, but isn't the truth that you and the President believe that Israel is on the right side in the war on terror and you want them to win this war, not to stop it?","Look, we care deeply about the people whose lives have been affected in Lebanon, just like we care deeply about the people whose lives have been affected in Israel. There's over a million people in Israel that are threatened by this consistent rocket attack coming out of Lebanon. And, yes, we want to help people rebuild their lives, absolutely. But we also want to address the root causes of the problem, and the root cause of the problem is you've got Hizballah that is armed and willing to fire rockets into Israel—a Hizballah, by the way, that I firmly believe is backed by Iran and encouraged by Iran.And so for the sake of long-term stability, we've got to deal with this issue now. Listen, the temptation is to say, It's too tough. Let's just try to solve it quickly with something that won't last; let's just get it off the TV screens. But that won't solve the problem. And it's certainly not going to help the Lebanese citizens have a life that is normal and peaceful.What is necessary is to help the Siniora Government, and one way to help the Siniora Government is to make aid available to help rebuild the houses that were destroyed. Another way to help the Siniora Government is to implement 1559, which is the disarmament of armed militia inside his country.And I—look, we care deeply about the lives that have been affected on both sides of this issue, just like I care deeply about the innocent people who are being killed in Iraq and people being denied a state in the Palestinian Territory. But make no mistake about it, it is the goal and aims of the terrorist organizations to stop that type of advance. That's what they're trying to do. They're trying to evoke sympathy for themselves. They're not sympathetic people. They're violent, coldblooded killers who are trying to stop the advance of freedom.And this is the calling of the 21st century, it seems like to me, and now is the time to confront the problem. And of course, we're going to help the people in Lebanon rebuild their lives. But as Tony said, this conflict started, out of the blue, with two Israeli soldiers kidnaped and rockets being fired across the border.Now, we have urged restraint. We made it clear that we care about wanton destruction. On the other hand, in my judgment, it would be a big mistake not to solve the underlying problems. Otherwise, everything will seem fine, and then you'll be back at a press conference saying, How come you didn't solve the underlying problems? We feel deeply for people in Lebanon and people in Israel who are the innocent casualties of this conflict. Of course we do. And we want it to stop, and we want it to stop now. And what we're putting forward today is actually a practical plan that would lead to a U.N. resolution—could be early next week—that would allow it, put in place the conditions for it to stop.But what we've also got to do is to make sure that we recognize that this action wasn't simply aimed against Israel, and then Israel retaliated. It was also aimed against the proper Government of Lebanon being able to control its own country. And the very reason why, 2 years ago, the international community passed this resolution was because people could see that what was going to happen in southern Lebanon was that these Hizballah militias, that are armed and financed by Iran and by Syria, were going to move into the south of the country in order to be a focus of terrorism and discontent.Now, that is the fact. And of course, all of us are appalled at the destruction and loss of life; of course, we are. And that's why we've actually come together today with a viable plan—if people can agree it, as I believe they can—to get it stopped. But once you stop this violence happening now—which, of course, we should do—once you do, it doesn't alter the underlying reality unless we've got a framework that allows us to put the Government of Lebanon properly back in charge of its own country; unless we've got the commitment to take forward the Israel-Palestine two-state deal, which is there and which everyone wants to see; and then if we can—unless we mobilize the international community, to deal with the threat that Iran poses.And there's no other way out of this. We're not—we can, all of us, make whatever statements we want to do, use whatever words we want to do, but the brutal reality of the situation is that we're only going to get violence stopped and stability introduced on the basis of clear principles.Now, as I say, we've set out a way to do this. But it requires the long term, as well as the short term.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct judgment: *Do you and the President believe that Israel is on the right side in the war on terror?* The expected answer would be a clear “yes,” “no,” or a qualified statement indicating the speaker’s belief.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response never states a straightforward position on whether Israel is “on the right side.”  
   - It talks about caring for civilians on both sides, about Hizballah, Iran, and the need to address root causes.  
   - It mentions Israel only in the context of rockets and destruction, but it does **not** answer the specific query about the speaker’s (or the President’s) belief regarding Israel’s stance in the war on terror.

3. **Information type** – The answer is **partial and indirect**. It provides related background but stops short of giving the explicit belief asked for. This matches the definition of an *ambivalent* response: the information is given incompletely, in a general/implicit, deflecting manner.

4. **Evasion check** – The speaker avoids a direct answer, instead offering a broader commentary. This is a classic case of deflection rather than a complete refusal to answer.

**Conclusion:** The response is incomplete and indirect; it does not explicitly answer the question but offers related, generalized remarks. Therefore it falls under the *Ambivalent* category.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants to know which *additional financial actions* the President would be willing to undertake if the Fed’s half‑point rate cut proves insufficient to avert a recession.

2. **What the answer contains** –  
   - The President says he does **not comment on Fed decisions**.  
   - He shifts the discussion to praising Ben Bernanke and to **fiscal policy** (budget balance, no tax increases).  
   - He mentions that the administration’s budget can be balanced by 2012 without raising taxes, but he never specifies *any concrete financial steps* (e.g., stimulus spending, borrowing, new programs) that would be taken if the rate cut were inadequate.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – The answer does **not** explicitly state the requested financial steps; it merely repeats a general stance on taxes and budget balance.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – The answer does provide some related information (budget balance, no tax hikes), so it is not a total refusal or ignorance.  
   - **Ambivalent** – The response **partially addresses** the topic (talks about fiscal policy and the budget) but does so in a **general, indirect, and deflecting** manner, without giving the specific “other financial steps” the question seeks.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct assessment of whether the discussed development “has improved the chances of something like Mideast peace” or instead “has made it more complicated.”

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee does not dodge the question.  
   - They explicitly say the development “offers an opportunity as well as a challenge.”  
   - They explain the *opportunity*: people who feel hope are “less likely to channel all their frustrations into anti‑Israeli sentiment,” which implies a positive effect on peace prospects.  
   - They also note the *challenge*: democracy is “messy,” requiring negotiation with many views.  
   - Finally, they give a clear evaluative judgment: “I like the odds of actually getting a better outcome in the former circumstance than in the latter.” This directly addresses the question by stating that, in their view, the odds favor an improvement in the chance for peace.

3. **Information provided** – The response supplies a concrete, explicit answer: it improves the chances (the “opportunity” side) but acknowledges complications. The key assessment is stated outright, not left vague or incomplete.

4. **Classification fit** –  
   - **Clear Reply** – The information requested (the interviewee’s judgment on whether the development improves the chances for Mideast peace) is explicitly stated.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a description of the concrete actions or strategies that President Lee Myung‑bak plans to use to reach an agreement on the KORUS FTA.

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee says:
   - “The talks will continue…”
   - “My Trade Minister … and the U.S. Trade Representative have been engaged in extensive discussions…”
   - “We need to give them a bit more time…”
   - “Once the G‑20 summit … discussions will continue and the officials from both sides will meet.”
   - “I expect it won’t take too long.”

   These statements directly identify the ongoing efforts: **continuing negotiations, ministerial discussions, giving more time, and planning future meetings**. The answer does not waffle or refuse to answer; it explicitly names the strategies that will be employed.

3. **Is the information explicit?** – Yes. The response spells out, in plain terms, the specific efforts (continuing talks, ministerial engagement, future meetings) that the President intends to pursue. While the wording is somewhat general, it is still a clear articulation of the intended actions.

4. **Does it meet the “Clear Reply” definition?** – The definition calls for the information to be “explicitly stated (in the requested form).” The answer meets this criterion because the requested form—describing the efforts—is directly provided.

46,Concern about financial institutions seeking investments from foreign government-controlled funds.,Q. The mortgage crisis is leading some of the Nation's biggest financial institutions to seek investments from funds that are controlled by foreign governments. Is that something that concerns you?,"No, I like to get our money back. I think the world that is open for investment and trade is a world that will lead to overall prosperity. It's interesting that they're going to have to do that. My attitude is, is that Wall Street needs to put all their—put it all out there for everybody to see. They need to have the— off-balance sheet this and put out there for investors to take a look at. And if there's some write-downs to be done, they need to do it now.And so I'm fine with capital coming in from overseas to help bolster financial institutions. I don't think it's a problem. I think what will be a problem is to say, we're not going to accept foreign capital, or we're not going to open markets, or we become protectionists. Protectionism would be a huge mistake for this country. And what's going to be an interesting test next year on whether or not we're going to be a country that trades with others and opens up markets is these free trade votes. I applaud the Congress for passing the Peruvian free trade deal. But we got some votes coming up with Colombia. That's going to be an interesting test to determine whether or not we remain—that we remain an open economy and that we expect others to treat us the way we treat them.And I spoke this morning to the President-elect of South Korea. And the people there are going to be watching very carefully as to whether or not our Congress understands the importance of the relationship and that they pass that free trade agreement with Korea. It's in our interests we do so.But no, I understand that people are— when they write down their assets, they may need to get a little extra capital on their balance sheets. And it doesn't trouble me at all; it doesn't. What troubles me is the fact that they—is that some of this paper isn't worth what people thought it was, and it's going to have to work through the system.Listen, thank you all.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct answer to whether the speaker is concerned about large financial institutions obtaining investment from funds controlled by foreign governments.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The speaker explicitly states, “No… I’m fine with capital coming in from overseas to help bolster financial institutions. I don’t think it’s a problem.” This directly answers the question and also explains the reasoning behind the stance.

3. **Information type** – The requested information (the speaker’s level of concern) is given **explicitly** and in the **requested form** (a clear “No, I’m not concerned”).

4. **Evasion or deflection?** – There is no evasion; the core concern is directly addressed and answered. The surrounding commentary about openness, protectionism, and free‑trade agreements does not obscure the explicit response to the question.

48,Is there any chance of getting a deal?,"Q. Is there any chance of getting a— of dealing? And Mr. Harper, can you comment in French and English, please?","Thank you. We are responding to congressional law. And I—let me reinterpret your—is your question, is there flexibility in the law, basically? Yes, I think that if Congress decides there needs to be flexibility, there will flexibility. Interestingly enough, the Senate passed—made its intention clear to extend deadlines. That hasn't happened in the House yet. And so we are operating in the executive branch under the idea that nothing will change, and therefore, we need to get to the Canadian Government as quickly as possible our definition of what a reasonable policy is. If Congress decides to be flexible, we obviously will be flexible.But the reason we're dealing with this issue is because the legislative branch put this into law, put the need to have these kind of documents into law. And as I told Chertoff, who is responsible for implementing the law, that I would like this— to the extent the law allows, for there to be a lot of flexibility and simplicity.As the Governor of Texas, I'm used to a border situation where hundreds of thousands of people crossed every day. See, we—on our southern border, there are a lot of Mexican citizens who come into the United States and work on a daily basis and then go back home. It happens a lot. And therefore, I fully understand the need for there to be simplicity in the documentation. It needs to be easy for somebody who is known and a person that is—makes a living on the other side of the border. There's—a lot of kids go to college in, like, El Paso, Texas, and they're living in Mexico, so they've got to go back and forth on a regular basis. So I'm familiar with this issue a lot, and I really do emphasize the need for us to be mindful of what a onerous program could mean to good relations as well as facilitation of trade.I can remember Stephen's concerns about the effect of this initiative might have on conventions, for example, in Canada. He brought up today an interesting example of Little League teams playing baseball in Manitoba. And so, in other words, there's a lot of just daily commerce that we've got to be mindful about, not just trade, but the movement of people. And we are, we are.And so to answer your question, if the Congress provides flexibility, of course we will work with the Canadian Government to extend deadlines. If the Congress says, No, this is what our intent is, we will work with the Canadian Government to make the law work.[] We're on two tracks here. We've indicated we want to cooperate. We understand this is a congressional law the administration has to put into place. We're prepared to cooperate to make it work as smoothly and effectively as possible. We need more information, and we've been pressing for that for some time, and we'll continue to do so.At the same time, our other track is obviously to encourage some reexamination of the law. The Senate has recently passed an amendment that would delay this process by a year and a half. We have some indications from some quarters of the House of Representatives, some will there to consider the same thing.As I say, we—and I just want to emphasize—we in Canada share the United States security concerns and objectives. I think, as you all know, recently with events in Toronto, it's been brought home to all of us that we face exactly the same kind of security threats and are defending exactly the same kinds of values. And I would hate to see a law go into place that has the effect of not just limiting and endangering trade or tourism but endangering all those thousands of social interactions that occur across our border every day and are the reason why Canada and the United States have the strongest relationship of any two countries, not just on the planet but in the history of mankind.And I would just urge the Congress to think carefully, that if the fight for security ends up meaning that the United States becomes more closed to its friends, then the terrorists have won. And I don't think either of us want that. So we're prepared to cooperate, and also urge the Congress to apply some flexibility in reaching their objectives of security. Thank you.Jim Axelrod [CBS News].",Ambivalent,"
**Step‑by‑step reasoning**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct assessment of whether a “deal” (i.e., some agreement or flexibility) is possible.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not give a simple “yes” or “no.”  
   - He talks about “flexibility” and says it will exist *if* Congress decides to be flexible.  
   - He discusses legislative processes, the need for simplicity, and the importance of cooperation with the Canadian government.  
   - The response is long, indirect, and leaves the actual likelihood of a deal unspecified.

3. **Information type** – The answer provides **partial, implicit information** about the conditions under which a deal might happen, but it never explicitly states whether a deal is likely or unlikely. It is therefore incomplete and somewhat evasive.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker shifts the focus to legislative mechanics and policy considerations rather than answering the straightforward question about the chance of a deal.

**Conclusion:** The response is not a clear, explicit answer; it is a partial, indirect, and somewhat evasive reply that does not fully address the question.

As I say, we take the findings seriously. And again, as I understand it—now please don't hold me to this—that there is a way forward with military tribunals in working with the United States Congress. As I understand, certain Senators have already been out expressing their desire to address what the Supreme Court found, and we will work with the Congress. I want to find a way forward.In other words, I have told the people that I would like for there to be a way to return people from Guantanamo to their home countries, but some of them—people need to be tried in our courts.

And we are; we've got people looking at it right now to determine how we can work with Congress, if that's available, to solve the problem.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks:**  
   The interviewer wants a direct answer to the yes/no question “Will the prison close?” – i.e., a clear statement of whether the prison will be closed.

2. **How the answer addresses it:**  
   - The interviewee does not give a straightforward yes or no.  
   - Instead, they hedge with phrases like “I haven’t had a chance to fully review…”, “as I understand it—now please don’t hold me to this…”, and “I would like for there to be a way…”.  
   - They discuss related issues (military tribunals, working with Congress, returning detainees, the Hamdan decision) but never commit to a definitive outcome regarding the closure of the prison.

3. **Information type:**  
   - The response is **partial and implicit**. It mentions possible pathways and intentions but stops short of confirming whether the prison will actually close.  
   - It is not a full refusal to answer (so it isn’t a “Clear Non‑Reply”), but it also does not provide the explicit answer that was requested.

4. **Evasion/deflection:**  
   - The speaker deflects by shifting to procedural discussion and by using qualifiers that leave the answer uncertain. This fits the definition of an **ambivalent** response—information is given, but it is incomplete, vague, and does not directly answer the question.

**Conclusion:** The response is incomplete and indirect; it does not give a clear yes or no but instead offers hedged, partial information.

   - The speaker does mention the abduction issue and says they “shall maintain close cooperation and coordination with the United States, including the abduction issue.”  
   - However, the response does **not** specify *what* that cooperation looks like (e.g., diplomatic pressure, joint investigations, UN referrals, etc.).  
   - The answer is largely a vague, general statement about “maintaining close cooperation” and “various opportunities,” without detailing any concrete measures.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – Requires the requested information to be explicitly stated in the requested form. The answer does not give a clear, explicit description of the cooperation; it only alludes to “close cooperation” in a generic way.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct assessment of whether the speaker can continue to sustain the same level of spending that has been invested in Iraq. The expected answer would be a clear “yes,” “no,” or a qualified statement confirming the ability (or inability) to maintain that spending level.

2. **What the answer provides** – The response talks about “making sure our troops have what it takes,” mentions political disagreement, and emphasizes support for service members. It never directly addresses the question about *continuing to sustain the spending level*; instead it offers a general, vague statement about support and hopes.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking for a concrete answer: *“What is the magnet?”* i.e., what specific factor or lever is intended to persuade Hizballah to accept a cease‑fire, stop shooting, and stop kidnapping soldiers.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not directly name or define the “magnet.”  
   - The response talks generally about “international pressure” and “the purpose of the United States working with allies… to send a clear message that sponsoring terror is unacceptable.”  
   - This is a broad, indirect statement that hints at a lever but never explicitly identifies the “magnet” itself.  
   - The answer remains vague, offers no specific mechanism, and shifts the focus to a larger policy goal rather than answering the question.

3. **Information type** – The response is **partial and implicit**. It touches on a related concept (international pressure) but does not clearly, explicitly, or fully answer the question about the “magnet.” It therefore falls short of a complete answer.

4. **Evasion check** – The reply can be seen as a deflection: instead of naming the magnet, it discusses a broader strategic aim. This matches the definition of an **ambivalent** response—information is given but incompletely, in a vague or indirect way.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct comment on the *desire of Cuban exiles to return home and reclaim their property* (i.e., a clear statement about how the administration views or plans to address that specific issue).

2. **What the answer provides** –  
   - The speaker mentions that “the Cuban people ought to decide” their government and that “once the people of Cuba decide their form of government, then Cuban Americans can take an interest in that country and redress the issues of property confiscation.”  
   - This is a **conditional, indirect** reference to property restitution, tied to a future political decision by Cubans.  
   - The response does not **explicitly** address the exiles’ desire to go home or outline any concrete policy or plan regarding property claims. Instead, it shifts the focus to a broader, future scenario and leaves the matter vague.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – No; the answer does not explicitly state the administration’s position or plan regarding the exiles’ desire to reclaim property.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – No; some relevant information is offered (the notion that property issues will be addressed after Cuban self‑determination), so it is not a total non‑reply.

55,Revisiting immigration in a lame-duck session after the election,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On another of your top priorities, immigration, leaders of both parties have indicated that any chance of comprehensive immigration reform is dead before the election. Is this an issue you would like to revisit in a lame-duck session after the election? Or would it be put off until the new Congress?","Bob, I strongly believe that in order to protect this border, Congress has got to pass a comprehensive plan that on the one hand provides additional money to secure the border and on the other hand recognizes that people are sneaking in here to do jobs Americans aren't doing. It would be better that they not sneak in, that they would come on a temporary basis, in an orderly way, to do work Americans aren't doing and then go home. And I will continue to urge Congress to think comprehensively about this vital piece of legislation.I went up to the Hill yesterday, and of course this topic came up. It's exactly what I told the Members of Congress. They wanted to know whether or not we were implementing border security measures that they had funded last January, and the answer is, we are. One of the key things I told them was we had ended what's called catch-and-release. That was a—you know, a Border Patrol agent would find somebody, particularly from—not from Mexico, and would say, Well, we don't have enough detention space, so why don't you come back and check in with the local person you're supposed to check in with, and then they'd never show back up. And that, of course, frustrated the Border Patrol agents; it frustrates American citizens; it frustrates me. And we ended it because Congress appropriated money that increased the number of beds available to detain people when we get them sneaking into our country illegally.The border has become modernized. And Secretary Chertoff here, later on this month, will be announcing further modernizations, as he has led a contract that will use all kinds of different technologies to make the border more secure. But in the long run, to secure this border, we've got to have a rational work plan.And finally, we're going to have to treat people with dignity in this country. Ours is a nation of immigrants, and when Congress gets down to a comprehensive bill, I would just remind them, it's virtually impossible to try to find 11 million folks— who have been here, working hard and, in some cases, raising families—and kick them out. It's just not going to work. But granting automatic citizenship won't work either. To me, that would just provide an additional incentive for people to try to sneak in, and so therefore, there is a rational way forward. I'll continue working—I don't know the timetable. My answer is, as soon as possible; that's what I'd like to see done.Thank you. Let's see, Wendell. Coming your way. Everybody is going to get one.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a clear answer about the speaker’s intention regarding immigration: will the issue be taken up during a possible lame‑duck session after the election, or will it be postponed until the new Congress?

2. **What the answer contains** – The speaker talks broadly about:
   - The need for a comprehensive immigration bill.
   - Urging Congress to act.
   - Specific border‑security measures (ending “catch‑and‑release,” more detention beds, technology upgrades).
   - A general statement that “I’ll continue working… My answer is, as soon as possible; that’s what I’d like to see done.”

   The response never explicitly says *“I will revisit it in the lame‑duck session”* or *“I will postpone it until the new Congress.”* It remains at the level of general urging and does not tie the discussion to the specific legislative timing asked about.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – The answer does **not** explicitly state the intended course of action regarding the lame‑duck session; therefore it is not a clear reply.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – The speaker does provide some related information (e.g., “I’ll continue working… as soon as possible”), so it is not a total refusal or ignorance; thus it is not a clear non‑reply.  
   - **Ambivalent** – The response is **partial and indirect**. It touches on the topic but leaves the specific question about a lame‑duck session unanswered, offering only a vague, general stance. This matches the definition of an ambivalent answer: incomplete, implicit, and somewhat deflecting.

**Conclusion:** The response is **Ambivalent** – it provides incomplete, indirect information about the timing of revisiting immigration rather than a direct answer to the question.

When you talked today about the violence in Baghdad, first you mentioned extremists, radicals, and then Al Qaida. It seems that Al Qaida and foreign fighters are much less of a problem there, and that it really is Iraqi versus Iraqi.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking for a justification: *Why wouldn’t you be frustrated, sir, about what’s happening?* They want an explanation of the speaker’s emotional stance.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response does not directly answer “why” the speaker would or would not be frustrated. Instead it:
   - States that the speaker “doesn’t remember being surprised.”
   - Says “I’m not sure what they meant by that.”
   - These remarks are vague, deflect the question, and leave the core issue (the reason for frustration) unaddressed.

3. **Information type** – The answer provides only partial, implicit information. It hints at a denial of surprise but does not explain the underlying reason for the lack of frustration. The response is therefore incomplete and evasive.

4. **Evasion check** – The speaker avoids giving a clear rationale; they shift focus to memory of the meeting and uncertainty about the meaning of “surprised.” This is characteristic of a deflection rather than a full answer.

I really don't know.And secondly, that our desire is for the Cuban people to be able to choose their own form of government, and we would hope that—and we'll make this very clear— that as Cuba has the possibility of transforming itself from a tyrannical situation to a different type of society, the Cuban people ought to decide. The people on the island of Cuba ought to decide.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a concrete description of the administration’s contingency plans for Fidel Castro’s death.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response never spells out any specific contingency measures.  
   - It mentions that “the Cuban people ought to decide” and that “Cuban Americans can take an interest … once the people of Cuba decide,” but these are general statements about future possibilities, not a detailed plan for handling Castro’s death.  
   - The answer is vague, indirect, and shifts focus to broader political themes rather than the requested contingency planning.

3. **Information type** – The answer provides only an implicit, partial response. It does not give a clear, explicit plan; instead it offers a general stance and deflects the question.

4. **Evasion check** – The response avoids directly answering the question about concrete contingency plans, making it a classic case of deflection.

58,Performance of the Fed in handling the financial crisis,"Q. Right here, sir. Switching gears slightly, in light of the financial regulation and reform that you have made, what is--how do you rate the performance of the Fed in handling the financial crisis? And more specifically, how do you rate the performance of Ben Bernanke, and would you like him to stay on when his term ends in January?","I'm not going to make news about Ben Bernanke--[]--although I think he has done a fine job under very difficult circumstances.I would say that all financial regulators didn't do everything that needed to be done to prevent the crisis from happening. And that's why we've put forward the boldest set of reforms in financial regulation in 75 years, because there were too many gaps; where there were laws on the books that would have brought about a prevention of the crisis, the enforcement wasn't there. In some cases, there just weren't sufficient laws on the books, for example, with the nonbanking sector.I think that the Fed probably performed better than most other regulators prior to the crisis taking place, but I think they'd be the first to acknowledge that in dealing with systemic risk and anticipating systemic risk, they didn't do everything that needed to be done.I think since the crisis has occurred, Ben Bernanke has performed very well. And one of the central concepts behind our financial regulatory reform is that there's got to be somebody who is responsible not just for monitoring the health of individual institutions, but somebody who's monitoring the systemic risks of the system as a whole. And we believe that the Fed has the most technical expertise and the best track record in terms of doing that.But that's not the only part of financial regulation. One of the things that we're putting a huge amount of emphasis on is the issue of consumer protection, whether it's subprime loans that were given out because nobody was paying attention to what was being peddled to consumers, whether it's how credit cards are handled, how annuities are dealt with, what people can expect in terms of understanding their 401(k)s. There's a whole bunch of financial transactions out there where consumers are not protected the way they should, and that's why we said, we're going to put forward a consumer financial protection agency whose only job it is to focus on those issues.Now, the Fed was one of the regulators that had some of those consumer responsibilities. We actually think that they're better off focusing on issues of broad systemic risk, and we have just one agency that's focused on the consumer protection side.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It requests an evaluation of the Federal Reserve’s performance in handling the financial crisis, and specifically asks for a rating of Ben Bernanke’s performance and whether he should stay on.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee directly discusses the Fed’s performance:
   - Acknowledges that “the Fed probably performed better than most other regulators prior to the crisis.”
   - Notes shortcomings (“they didn’t do everything that needed to be done”).
   - Provides a positive assessment of Bernanke’s post‑crisis performance (“Ben Bernanke has performed very well”).
   - Explains the rationale behind the reform (systemic‑risk monitoring) and why the Fed is well‑suited for that role.

3. **Information type** – The response supplies an explicit, concrete evaluation of the Fed’s handling of the crisis and of Bernanke’s performance. The evaluation is given in the same form requested (a rating/assessment).

4. **Evasion or incompleteness?** – No evasion occurs; the answer does not refuse to answer, nor does it remain vague or only partially address the question. It offers a clear judgment, albeit a nuanced one.

We passed law that encouraged consumption through different purchasing habits, like hybrid vehicles. You buy a hybrid, you get a tax credit. We've encouraged the spread of ethanol as an alternative to crude oil. We have asked for Congress to pass regulatory relief so we can build more refineries to increase the supply of gasoline, hopefully taking the pressure off of price.And so the strategy is to recognize that dependency upon crude oil is—in a global market affects us economically here at home, and therefore, we need to diversify away as quickly as possible.Jackson.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

Thank you, sir. Even after hearing that one of the major conclusions of the National Intelligence Estimate in April was that the Iraq war has fueled terror growth around the world, why have you continued to say that the Iraq war has made this country safer?And to President Karzai, if I might, what do you think of President Musharraf's comments that you need to get to know your own country better when you're talking about where terror threats and the Taliban threat is coming from?","Do you want to start? Go ahead, please. [] I, of course, read the key judgments on the NIE. I agree with their conclusion that because of our successes against the leadership of Al Qaida, the enemy is becoming more diffuse and independent. I'm not surprised the enemy is exploiting the situation in Iraq and using it as a propaganda tool to try to recruit more people to their murderous ways.Some people have guessed what's in the report and have concluded that going into Iraq was a mistake. I strongly disagree. I think it's naive. I think it's a mistake for people to believe that going on the offense against people that want to do harm to the American people makes us less safe. The terrorists fight us in Iraq for a reason: They want to try to stop a young democracy from developing, just like they're trying to fight this young democracy in Afghanistan. And they use it as a recruitment tool, because they understand the stakes. They understand what will happen to them when we defeat them in Iraq.You know, to suggest that if we weren't in Iraq, we would see a rosier scenario with fewer extremists joining the radical movement requires us to ignore 20 years of experience. We weren't in Iraq when we got attacked on September the 11th. We weren't in Iraq, and thousands of fighters were trained in terror camps inside your country, Mr. President. We weren't in Iraq when they first attacked the World Trade Center in 1993. We weren't in Iraq when they bombed the . We weren't in Iraq when they blew up our Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. My judgment is, if we weren't in Iraq, they'd find some other excuse, because they have ambitions. They kill in order to achieve their objectives.You know, in the past, Usama bin Laden used Somalia as an excuse for people to join his jihadist movement. In the past, they used the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It was a convenient way to try to recruit people to their jihadist movement. They've used all kinds of excuses.This Government is going to do whatever it takes to protect this homeland. We're not going to let their excuses stop us from staying on the offense. The best way to protect America is defeat these killers overseas so we do not have to face them here at home. We're not going to let lies and propaganda by the enemy dictate how we win this war.Now, you know what's interesting about the NIE? It was a intelligence report done last April. As I understand, the conclusions—the evidence on the conclusions reached was stopped being gathered on February—at the end of February. And here we are, coming down the stretch in an election campaign, and it's on the front page of your newspapers. Isn't that interesting? Somebody has taken it upon themselves to leak classified information for political purposes.I talked to John Negroponte today, the DNI. You know, I think it's a bad habit for our Government to declassify every time there's a leak, because it means that it's going to be hard to get good product out of our analysts. Those of you who have been around here long enough know what I'm talking about. But once again, there's a leak out of our Government, coming right down the stretch in this campaign, to create confusion in the minds of the American people, in my judgment, is why they leaked it.And so we're going to—I told the DNI to declassify this document. You can read it for yourself. We'll stop all the speculation, all the politics about somebody saying something about Iraq, somebody trying to confuse the American people about the nature of this enemy. And so John Negroponte, the DNI, is going to declassify the document as quickly as possible. He'll declassify the key judgments for you to read yourself. And he'll do so in such a way that we'll be able to protect sources and methods that our intelligence community uses. And then everybody can draw their own conclusions about what the report says.Thank you.",Clear Non-Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

All of us want to find out the facts. I mean, this is disgusting behavior when a Member of Congress betrays the trust of the Congress and a family that sent a young page up to serve in the Congress. And I appreciated Speaker Hastert's strong declaration of his desire to get to the bottom of it. And we want to make sure we understand what Republicans knew and what Democrats knew, in order to find the facts. And I hope that happens sooner rather than later.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct assessment of whether House Speaker Hastert “has lost touch within his own ranks.” The expected answer would be a clear yes or no (or an explicit statement explaining the situation).

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee does **not** answer the question with a yes/no or with any substantive judgment about Hastert’s relationship with his party members.  
   - Instead, the response talks generally about “strong statements,” “finding out the facts,” and “disgusting behavior,” but never addresses the specific issue of whether Hastert has lost touch internally.

3. **Nature of the response** – The answer is **deflective** and **general**: it shifts the focus to a desire to investigate the scandal rather than providing the requested evaluation of Hastert’s standing with his ranks. It offers no concrete information about his perceived disconnect.

4. **Classification fit** –  
   - **Clear Reply** – No, because the requested information (a direct assessment) is not explicitly given.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – This would apply if the respondent simply refused to answer or admitted ignorance. Here they do respond, but the response is **incomplete and evasive**.  
   - **Ambivalent** – This category covers answers that are “too general, partial, implicit, dodging, or deflection.” The response fits this description: it deflects the question and provides only vague, indirect commentary.

**Conclusion:** The interviewee’s answer does not directly answer the question; it is a vague, deflective reply that leaves the question unanswered.

**LABEL: Ambivalent**","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to the specific question: ""Has House Speaker Hastert lost touch within his own ranks?"" The answer given is a longer statement about Speaker\'s strong statements, wanting to find out facts, etc. Does it directly answer the question? It does not explicitly say yes or no. It talks about wanting to find out facts, but does not address whether Hastert has lost touch within his own ranks. It\'s more about wanting to investigate, not answering the question. So it\'s a non-answer, but does it count as Clear Non-Reply? The categories: Clear Non-Reply - information requested is not given at all due to ignorance, need for clarification, or declining to answer. The answer does not give a direct answer; it\'s a deflection. It\'s not an incomplete answer; it\'s more like evasion. That fits Clear Non-Reply? Or Ambivalent? Ambivalent is incomplete, partial, implicit, dodging, deflection. The answer is deflecting, not directly answering. That seems Ambivalent? But the question: ""Has House Speaker Hastert lost touch within his own ranks?"" The answer does not address that directly; it\'s more about wanting to find out facts. That\'s a deflection. That is Ambivalent? The definition: Ambivalent - information requested is given in an incomplete way (e.g., answer is too general, partial, implicit, dodging, or deflection). The answer is deflection, so it\'s Ambivalent. However, Clear Non-Reply is when the information requested is not given at all due to ignorance, need for clarification, or declining to answer. Here they are not declining; they are giving a statement but not answering. That\'s more like Ambivalent (dodging). So classification: Ambivalent.\n'}]",Clear Reply
64,Will the President pledge to the family of Corporal Pat Tillman that the government and administration will finally get to the bottom of his death?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You speak often about taking care of the troops and honoring their sacrifice. But the family of Corporal Pat Tillman believes there was a coverup regarding his death, and some say perhaps he was even murdered, instead of just friendly fire. At a hearing last week on Capitol Hill, your former Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, other officials used some version of I don't recall 82 times. When it was his term to step up, Pat Tillman gave up a lucrative NFL career, served his country, and paid the ultimate sacrifice. Now you have a chance to pledge to the family that your Government, your administration will finally get to the bottom of it. Will you make that pledge to the family today, that you'll finally, after seven investigations, find out what really happened?","Well, first of all, I can understand why 's family, you know, has got significant emotions, because a man they loved and respected was killed while he was serving his country. I always admired the fact that a person who was relatively comfortable in life would be willing to take off one uniform and put on another to defend America. And the best way to honor that commitment of his is to find out the truth. And I'm confident the Defense Department wants to find out the truth too, and we'll lay it out for the Tillman family to know.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct answer: *Will the President formally pledge to the Tillman family that the administration will finally get to the bottom of Corporal Pat Tillman’s death?* The expected response would be a clear “yes” or “no,” or an explicit statement of a pledge.

2. **What the answer provides** – The interviewee:
   - Acknowledges the family’s emotions.
   - Expresses admiration for Tillman’s sacrifice.
   - Says the best way to honor him is “to find out the truth.”
   - Claims confidence that the Defense Department wants to find out the truth and that they “will lay it out for the Tillman family to know.”

   The response never says outright “I pledge…,” nor does it promise a new investigation or a specific commitment beyond the vague notion of “finding out the truth.” It is largely a general, reassuring statement that stops short of a concrete pledge.

3. **Does the answer give the requested information explicitly?** – No. It does not answer the question with a clear “yes, I will pledge” or “no, I will not.” Instead, it offers a vague assurance that the truth will be uncovered and communicated.

4. **Is the answer a non‑reply, an ambivalent reply, or a clear reply?**  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** would apply if the respondent gave *no* relevant information at all (e.g., “I don’t know” or “I decline to answer”). Here, some relevant information is offered (the intention to “find out the truth” and “lay it out”).  
   - **Clear Reply** would require an explicit statement that the President *will* make the pledge. That is absent.  
   - **Ambivalent** fits best because the answer is **incomplete and indirect**: it touches on the issue, offers a partial reassurance, but stops short of a definitive pledge, leaving the question only partially answered.

**Conclusion:** The response is an incomplete, indirect answer that does not explicitly address the request for a pledge. It falls under the **Ambivalent** category.

That\'s a promise to inform them, but not a direct pledge to investigate further after seven investigations. It\'s somewhat vague but does commit to ""find out the truth"" and ""lay it out"".

65,"Mr. Harper, can you comment in French and English, please?","Q. Is there any chance of getting a— of dealing? And Mr. Harper, can you comment in French and English, please?","Thank you. We are responding to congressional law. And I—let me reinterpret your—is your question, is there flexibility in the law, basically? Yes, I think that if Congress decides there needs to be flexibility, there will flexibility. Interestingly enough, the Senate passed—made its intention clear to extend deadlines. That hasn't happened in the House yet. And so we are operating in the executive branch under the idea that nothing will change, and therefore, we need to get to the Canadian Government as quickly as possible our definition of what a reasonable policy is. If Congress decides to be flexible, we obviously will be flexible.But the reason we're dealing with this issue is because the legislative branch put this into law, put the need to have these kind of documents into law. And as I told Chertoff, who is responsible for implementing the law, that I would like this— to the extent the law allows, for there to be a lot of flexibility and simplicity.As the Governor of Texas, I'm used to a border situation where hundreds of thousands of people crossed every day. See, we—on our southern border, there are a lot of Mexican citizens who come into the United States and work on a daily basis and then go back home. It happens a lot. And therefore, I fully understand the need for there to be simplicity in the documentation. It needs to be easy for somebody who is known and a person that is—makes a living on the other side of the border. There's—a lot of kids go to college in, like, El Paso, Texas, and they're living in Mexico, so they've got to go back and forth on a regular basis. So I'm familiar with this issue a lot, and I really do emphasize the need for us to be mindful of what a onerous program could mean to good relations as well as facilitation of trade.I can remember Stephen's concerns about the effect of this initiative might have on conventions, for example, in Canada. He brought up today an interesting example of Little League teams playing baseball in Manitoba. And so, in other words, there's a lot of just daily commerce that we've got to be mindful about, not just trade, but the movement of people. And we are, we are.And so to answer your question, if the Congress provides flexibility, of course we will work with the Canadian Government to extend deadlines. If the Congress says, No, this is what our intent is, we will work with the Canadian Government to make the law work.[] We're on two tracks here. We've indicated we want to cooperate. We understand this is a congressional law the administration has to put into place. We're prepared to cooperate to make it work as smoothly and effectively as possible. We need more information, and we've been pressing for that for some time, and we'll continue to do so.At the same time, our other track is obviously to encourage some reexamination of the law. The Senate has recently passed an amendment that would delay this process by a year and a half. We have some indications from some quarters of the House of Representatives, some will there to consider the same thing.As I say, we—and I just want to emphasize—we in Canada share the United States security concerns and objectives. I think, as you all know, recently with events in Toronto, it's been brought home to all of us that we face exactly the same kind of security threats and are defending exactly the same kinds of values. And I would hate to see a law go into place that has the effect of not just limiting and endangering trade or tourism but endangering all those thousands of social interactions that occur across our border every day and are the reason why Canada and the United States have the strongest relationship of any two countries, not just on the planet but in the history of mankind.And I would just urge the Congress to think carefully, that if the fight for security ends up meaning that the United States becomes more closed to its friends, then the terrorists have won. And I don't think either of us want that. So we're prepared to cooperate, and also urge the Congress to apply some flexibility in reaching their objectives of security.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is explicitly requesting that the interviewee (Mr. Harper) provide a comment **in both French and English**. The request is for a bilingual response to that specific prompt.

2. **What the answer contains** – The interviewee launches into a lengthy discussion about U.S. congressional law, flexibility, border issues, and related policy matters. The response never includes any comment in French, never includes any comment in English that addresses the request, and does not acknowledge the bilingual requirement at all.

3. **Does the answer provide the requested information?** – No. The answer does not fulfill the request to comment in French and English. It completely sidesteps the request and instead delivers unrelated substantive content.

4. **Classification criteria**  
   - **Clear Reply** – Would require the requested information to be explicitly stated. This is not the case.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – Applies when the requested information is not given at all, due to evasion, ignorance, or refusal. The response wholly ignores the bilingual comment request.  
   - **Ambivalent** – Would apply if the answer were partially relevant but incomplete or vague. Here the answer is unrelated, not merely vague.

5. **Conclusion** – The interviewee fails to answer the question in any form; the request is ignored entirely. This matches the definition of a **Clear Non‑Reply**.

You have discussed the Iranian nuclear issue in terms of what has happened before and what may happen in the future. There is now the situation with the Iranian nuclear issue. How do you see it as of now? And most importantly, what are we to expect in the future?","——progress, because Russia and the United States agree that should not have a nuclear weapon. In other words, the ians need to understand that we're speaking with one voice that they shouldn't have a weapon, and that's progress.You see, my judgment is they're testing the resolve of the parties to determine whether or not we really are resolved to work together to prevent them from having a weapon. And the clearer they hear a message, the better off—or the closer we'll be to them recognizing there's a better way forward. See, we've made our choice, and that's progress. We've agreed to work together to achieve a common goal. That's considerable progress.And now the choice is theirs to make.

We will sit side by side.Right now we're negotiating together to send a common message. We will come to the table. It's their choice to make, however. There is a better way forward for the ian people than to be isolated because of their Government's actions. And so I would say that we've made good progress on the issue.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants the interviewee’s assessment of the *current* state of the Iranian nuclear issue and an outlook for the future.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee explicitly states:
   - “We’ve made good progress on the issue.”
   - “They’re testing the resolve of the parties…”
   - “We will come to the negotiating table… if they verifiably suspend their enrichment program.”
   - “There is a better way forward for the Iranian people…”
   These statements directly describe the present situation (progress, testing of resolve, conditional negotiations) and therefore answer the question.

3. **Is the information explicit?** – Yes. The answer provides concrete statements about the current state (“progress,” “testing resolve,” “conditional negotiation”) rather than remaining silent, refusing to answer, or offering only vague generalities without any substantive content.

4. **Is it a non‑reply or ambivalent?** – No. The response does not evade the question, nor does it give only a partial or ambiguous answer. It supplies a clear, albeit somewhat verbose, judgment of the current situation.

**Conclusion:** The interviewee supplies an explicit description of how they view the present state of the Iranian nuclear issue.

**LABEL: Clear Reply**","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to ""How do you see the situation with the Iranian nuclear issue as of now?""

1. **What the question asks** – It wants to know whether the interviewee (or the group referred to as “the individuals”) is satisfied with the assurances that have been given regarding the tribal deal.

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee says:  
   - “I appreciate the briefing on the tribal deal.”  
   - “When the President looks me in the eye and says… I believe him.”  
   - “We collaborate… and we talk a lot about how best to do this.”  

   These statements directly convey that the speaker **believes** the assurances and **appreciates** the briefing, which is an explicit indication of satisfaction.

3. **Is the information explicit?** – Yes. The speaker does not hedge or give a vague, partial answer; they clearly express belief in and approval of the President’s assurances, which answers the question about satisfaction.

4. **Is there any evasion or incompleteness?** – No. The answer does not dodge the question, nor does it remain incomplete or ambiguous. It directly addresses the issue of satisfaction with the tribal‑deal assurances.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a clear statement of the *remaining* tasks or unfinished work that the administration still needs to address regarding post‑Katrina recovery.

2. **How the answer responds** –  
   - The interviewee enumerates *what has already been done*: a $110 billion commitment, rental assistance, infrastructure repair, debris removal percentages, etc.  
   - He mentions that “Louisiana is slower in terms of getting debris removed” and that “people can get after it,” but he never explicitly lists the *unfinished* items or the next steps that still need to be taken.  
   - The response ends with a vague suggestion that “I would hope they would” (referring to people taking action), without a concrete articulation of what still must be done.

3. **Information type** – The answer provides *partial* information: it describes past actions and some ongoing efforts, but it does **not** directly answer the specific request for what *remains* to be done. The response is therefore incomplete and indirect.

4. **Evasion/deflection?** – The speaker does not outright refuse to answer, nor does he express ignorance; instead, he shifts to a general recounting of past expenditures and progress, leaving the core question unanswered. This fits the pattern of an *ambivalent* reply—information is given but it is too general and does not fully satisfy the request.

**Conclusion:** The response is incomplete and does not explicitly state what remains to be done; it is therefore **Ambivalent**.

You referred to it as a Third Awakening. I wonder if you could tell us about—what you meant by that, what led you to that conclusion? And do you see any contradictory evidence in the culture?","No, I said—Mike, thanks. I was just speculating that the culture might be changing, and I was talking about when you're involved with making decisions of historic nature, you won't be around to see the effects of your decisions. And I said that when I work the ropelines, a lot of people come and say, Mr. President, I'm praying for you—a lot. As a matter of fact, it seems like a lot more now than when I was working ropelines in 1994. And I asked them—I was asking their opinion about whether or not there was a Third Awakening, I called it.I'd just read a book on Abraham Lincoln, and his Presidency was right around the time of what they called the Second Awakening, and I was curious to know whether or not these smart people felt like there was any historical parallels. I also said that I had run for office the first time to change a culture—Herman and Hutch remember me saying, you know, the culture that said, If it feels good, do it, and if you've got a problem, blame somebody else—to helping to work change a culture in which each of us are responsible for the decisions we make in life. In other words, ushering in a responsibility era. And I reminded people that responsibility means, if you're a father, love your child; or if you're corporate America, be honest with the taxpayers; if you're a citizen of this country, love your neighbor.And so I was wondering out loud with them. It seems like to me that something is happening in the religious life of America. But I'm not a very good focus group either. I'm encapsulated here. I'm able to see a lot of people, and from my perspective, people are coming to say, I'm praying for you. And it's an uplifting part of being the President; it inspires me.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a clear explanation of the phrase “Third Awakening” that the speaker used in a prior meeting. Specifically: *What did you mean by “Third Awakening”?*

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The speaker does not give a concise definition of “Third Awakening.” Instead, he:
   - Talks about “speculating that the culture might be changing.”
   - Mentions reading a book on Abraham Lincoln and the “Second Awakening.”
   - Describes a personal anecdote about “rope‑lines,” prayers, and a “responsibility era.”
   - Provides a vague, indirect description of cultural change rather than a direct answer to what “Third Awakening” means.

3. **Information type** – The response is **partial and implicit**. It offers related context (historical awakenings, cultural change, responsibility) but never explicitly states what the speaker intended by “Third Awakening.” The answer is therefore incomplete and somewhat evasive.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker shifts the focus to personal stories and broader cultural observations rather than directly answering the question. This fits the pattern of a **dodging/deflection** response.

5. **Classification decision** – Because the answer supplies some related information but does so in an incomplete, indirect, and non‑explicit manner, it matches the definition of **Ambivalent**: the requested information is given but in an incomplete, implicit, or partially dodging way.

**LABEL: Ambivalent**","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to ""What did you mean by \'Third Awakening\'?""

70, Asking about the President's feelings towards war rhetoric and going to war with Iraq.,"Q. Mr. President, on the way to Europe, you gave a very interesting interview for the Times newspaper in which you basically said that you regret your war rhetoric. Now I'm wondering, do you actually just regret your war rhetoric, or do you regret having gone to war with Iraq?","I don't regret it at all. Removing Saddam Hussein made the world a safer place. And yes, I told the guy— the guy said, Now what could you do over? First of all, you don't get to do things over in my line of work. But I could have used better rhetoric to indicate that, one, we tried to exhaust the diplomacy in Iraq; two, that I don't like war. But, no, the decision to remove Saddam Hussein was the right decision.Myers [Steven Lee Myers, New York Times]. I mean—no, no, Eggen [Dan Eggen, Washington Post], Eggen, excuse me. I called you yesterday, Myers. What's the difference? []",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks the President’s explicit stance on two related matters:  
   * (a) whether he regrets the war‑rhetoric he used, and  
   * (b) whether he regrets having gone to war with Iraq.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee gives a direct, unambiguous response:  
   * “I don’t regret it at all.”  
   * He explains that removing Saddam Hussein “made the world a safer place.”  
   * He acknowledges that better rhetoric could have signaled that diplomacy was exhausted and that he “don’t like war,” but ultimately states, “the decision to remove Saddam Hussein was the right decision.”  

   This fully answers both parts of the question, providing a clear affirmative stance and a brief justification.

3. **Information type** – The requested information is **explicitly stated** in the form requested (a clear yes/no position on regret and on the war decision). No evasion, deflection, or vague generalities are present.

4. **Evasion check** – There is no refusal, ignorance, or request for clarification; the answer directly addresses the query.

**Conclusion:** The response provides a clear, explicit answer to the question.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants the interviewee’s opinion on whether the diplomatic process could “drag out for a while,” i.e., a clear assessment of the likely duration.

2. **How the answer addresses it** –  
   - The interviewee begins with “I don’t know,” which signals uncertainty, but then shifts to a broader statement about wanting a diplomatic solution and the value of multiple voices.  
   - No explicit judgment is offered about the length of the process (e.g., “It could drag on for years” or “It will be resolved quickly”).  
   - The response is largely a deflection that discusses the desirability of multilateral messaging rather than answering the specific query about duration.

3. **Information type** – The answer is **incomplete** and **implicit**. It does not provide the requested opinion on the potential duration; it only hints at uncertainty and then moves to unrelated points.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The response avoids giving a direct answer and instead emphasizes the diplomatic approach and coalition-building, which does not satisfy the question’s demand for an opinion on how long the process might take.

**Conclusion:** The response is neither a clear affirmative/negative answer nor a complete refusal to answer; it offers a vague, partial, and indirect reply that leaves the requested opinion unspecified.

72,Reappointment of U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald,"Q. Thank you very much. Mr. President, the work of U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald in prosecuting alleged corruption is well-known here in Chicago as well as nationally. It's my understanding that technically, he hasn't been reappointed to his position and serves at your pleasure. Do you have any plans to formally reappoint him to the post, or any other position at Department of Justice?",As a special prosecutor?,Clear Non-Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking directly whether the President plans to formally reappoint U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald (or assign him another DOJ position). The expected response would be a clear statement of intent (e.g., “Yes, I intend to reappoint him,” or “No, I have no plans to do so”).

2. **What the answer provides** – The interviewee replies only with the words “As a special prosecutor?” – a fragment that does not address the reappointment question at all. It does not state any intention, nor does it explain the situation; it merely poses a question.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – Not satisfied; the answer does not explicitly state any information about the reappointment.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – Satisfied; the requested information is *not given at all*. The response is essentially a non‑answer that offers no substantive information, reflecting a refusal or inability to answer the question.  
   - **Ambivalent** – Not applicable; the answer is not an incomplete or partially‑addressed response—it provides *no* substantive content, which fits the definition of a non‑reply rather than a partially‑answered one.

**Conclusion:** The interviewee’s response fails to provide any information about the reappointment of U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald; it is a non‑answer.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct answer to the yes/no query: *“Do you stand by this choice?”* (i.e., does the interviewee endorse the President’s selection of the FDA Commissioner?)

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee says:  
   - “I support Andy’s decision.”  
   This is a clear, affirmative statement that the interviewee backs the President’s choice. It directly addresses the question without ambiguity or deflection.

3. **Is the requested information explicitly given?** – Yes. The phrase “I support Andy’s decision” explicitly conveys the interviewee’s stance on the choice. There is no evasion, omission, or vague qualification; the answer states outright that the choice is supported.

4. **Classification decision** – Because the answer provides an explicit affirmation of the stance asked for, it fits the definition of a **Clear Reply**.

74,Are you considering a plan to cut corporate taxes?,"Q. Mr. President, are you considering a plan to cut corporate taxes? Do you believe America's corporations are not making enough money these days?","Actually, we had an interesting discussion on this subject. And if you read carefully the penetrating reporter by the financial reporter—kind of, like, semi-financial reporter—[]—you'll find that it was—I was talking about an idea that has begun to surface as a result of meetings being held at the Treasury Department.And the whole reason to look at corporate rates is to determine whether or not they make us less competitive in a global economy. And if so—in other words, if the conclusion is, is that our tax structure makes it harder for businesses to compete, therefore making it harder for people to find work over time, then we need to address the competitive imbalance in our Tax Code.I also made it clear that we're at the very early stages of discussion and that, in my own judgment, anything that would be submitted to Congress—if submitted at all—would have to be revenue neutral. And therefore, what we'd really be talking about is a simplification of a very complex Tax Code that might be able to lower rates and, at the same time, simplify the code, which is, like, shorthand for certain deductions would be taken away—in other words, certain tax preferences in the code.My view all along has been, the more simple the code, the better, whether it be in the individual income tax side or the corporate tax side. However, I would readily concede to you this is a difficult issue, because the reason there is tax preferences in the first place are there are powerful interests that have worked to get the preference in the code. And as I remarked to the distinguished group of writers I was talking to yesterday, it's much easier to get something in the code than get it out of the code.But I do think it's in the interests to constantly evaluate our competitive advantages and disadvantages. And what Hank Paulson told me was that there's a lot of folks who really believe the Tax Code creates a competitive disadvantage, and therefore, it's certainly worth looking at.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct answer to whether the interviewee is *considering* a plan to cut corporate taxes. A “clear reply” would be a straightforward “yes,” “no,” or “I am currently evaluating such a plan.”

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not give a simple yes/no. Instead, they:
   - Talk about “an idea that has begun to surface” and discuss the broader context of tax competitiveness.
   - Mention that any proposal would have to be “revenue neutral” and would involve “simplifying” the tax code.
   - State that they are “at the very early stages of discussion.”
   - Acknowledge that “anything … would have to be submitted to Congress” and that it is “difficult” to change the code.
   - Ultimately say they think it is “worth looking at” but never commit to a concrete plan.

3. **Information provided** – The response is **partial and implicit**. It touches on the topic, outlines conditions, and signals openness to examination, but it never explicitly states whether a plan is being considered. The answer is vague, uses conditional language, and shifts focus to the complexity of tax reform rather than confirming or denying the existence of a plan.

4. **Classification decision** – Because the answer gives **some** information about the subject (early‑stage discussion, conditions for any change) but does **not** provide a clear, definitive response, it falls into the category where the requested information is given **in an incomplete, indirect, or partially evasive way**.

75,What do you think about Senator McCain's statement that your plan will put U.S. troops at risk?,"Q. Thank you very much, sir. What do you say to the argument that your proposal is basically seeking support for torture, coerced evidence, and secret hearings? And Senator McCain says your plan will put U.S. troops at risk. What do you think about that?","This debate is occurring because of the Supreme Court's ruling that said that we must conduct ourselves under the Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention. And that Common Article Three says that there will be no outrages upon human dignity. It's very vague. What does that mean, outrages upon human dignity? That's a statement that is wide open to interpretation. And what I'm proposing is that there be clarity in the law so that our professionals will have no doubt that that which they are doing is legal. You know, it's—and so the piece of legislation I sent up there provides our professionals that which is needed to go forward.The first question that we've got to ask is, do we need the program? I believe we do need the program. And I detailed in a speech in the East Room what the program has yield—in other words, the kind of information we get when we interrogate people within the law. You see, sometimes you can pick up information on the battlefield; sometimes you can pick it up through letters; but sometimes you actually have to question the people who know the strategy and plans of the enemy. And in this case, we questioned people like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who we believe ordered the attacks on 9/11, or Ramzi bin al-Shibh or Abu Zubaydah, coldblooded killers who were part of planning the attack that killed 3,000 people. And we need to be able to question them, because it helps yield information, information necessary for us to be able to do our job.Now, the Court said that you've got to live under Article 3 of the Geneva Convention, and the standards are so vague that our professionals won't be able to carry forward the program, because they don't want to be tried as war criminals. They don't want to break the law. These are decent, honorable citizens who are on the frontline of protecting the American people, and they expect our Government to give them clarity about what is right and what is wrong in the law. And that's what we have asked to do.And we believe a good way to go is to use the amendment that we worked with John McCain on, called the Detainee Treatment Act, as the basis for clarity for people we would ask to question the enemy. In other words, it is a way to bring U.S. law into play. It provides more clarity for our professionals, and that's what these people expect. These are decent citizens who don't want to break the law.Now, this idea that somehow we've got to live under international treaties, you know—and that's fine; we do; but oftentimes the United States Government passes law to clarify obligations under international treaty. And what I'm concerned about is if we don't do that, then it's very conceivable our professionals could be held to account based upon court decisions in other countries. And I don't believe Americans want that. I believe Americans want us to protect the country, to have clear standards for our law enforcement, intelligence officers, and give them the tools necessary to protect us within the law.It's an important debate, Steve. It really is. It's a debate that really is going to define whether or not we can protect ourselves. I will tell you this: I've spent a lot of time on this issue, as you can imagine, and I've talked to professionals, people I count on for advice; these are people that are going to represent those on the frontline of protecting this country. They're not going forward with the program. They're not going—the professionals will not step up unless there's clarity in the law. So Congress has got a decision to make: Do you want the program to go forward or not?I strongly recommend that this program go forward in order for us to be able to protect America.Hillman. This is Hillman's last press conference, so—sorry, sorry, about that.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants the interviewee’s direct reaction to Senator McCain’s claim that the interviewee’s plan “will put U.S. troops at risk.” The expected answer would address that specific concern, either accepting, rejecting, or explaining it.

2. **What the answer actually does** –  
   - The response is a broad discussion of legal‑policy issues (Common Article 3, “outrages upon human dignity,” need for legislative clarity, etc.).  
   - It mentions Senator McCain only in passing, as part of a description of a “Detainee Treatment Act” amendment that was worked on with him.  
   - It never directly addresses the allegation that the plan endangers troops; instead it shifts to arguments about legal clarity and the necessity of interrogation programs.

3. **Does the answer give the requested information?** – No. The core allegation (troop risk) is not evaluated, affirmed, or rebutted. The answer is therefore incomplete with respect to the specific question.

4. **Is it a non‑reply?** – Not exactly. The interviewee does provide substantive content, but it is unrelated to the asked‑about troop‑risk claim. It is not a refusal to answer out of ignorance or deliberate silence; rather, it sidesteps the question.

They believe that there's, no question, violence; they believe that Al Qaida is still creating havoc; they know there's people taking reprisal; they're confident there are still Saddamists who are threatening people and carrying out attacks.But they also believe that the Baghdad security plan is making progress. There was a lot of discussion about Al Anbar Province recently, and I spent some time talking with our commanders. No question, it's a dangerous place. It's a place where Al Qaida is really trying to root themselves; it's a place from which they'd like to operate. You know, this business about Al Qaida, Al Anbar's loss is just not the case; it's not what our commanders think.So to answer your question, there's no question, it's tough.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a concrete definition of the “threshold” that would lead the speaker to label the situation in Iraq as a civil war. In other words, they are asking for a specific criterion or condition that must be met.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The respondent does not give a clear, explicit threshold. Instead, they:
   - Deflect by talking about speculation and sources they consulted.
   - Restate that the Iraqi government does not view it as a civil war.
   - List general observations about violence, Al‑Qaida activity, and the security plan.
   - Conclude with vague, broad criteria (“whether the unity government is moving forward… whether Iraqi troops are doing their jobs”) but never specify a concrete trigger or threshold.

3. **Information type** – The response is **partial and implicit**. It offers related ideas but stops short of answering the precise question. It is not a full refusal to answer (so it isn’t a Clear Non‑Reply), nor does it give a definitive answer (so it isn’t a Clear Reply). Rather, it provides an incomplete, somewhat evasive answer.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The answer shifts the focus to general assessment criteria without defining a clear threshold, which fits the definition of a **dodging or deflection**.

78,Do you believe that the previous administration sanctioned torture?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You've said in the past that waterboarding, in your opinion, is torture. And torture is a violation of international law and the Geneva Conventions. Do you believe that the previous administration sanctioned torture?","What I've said, and I will repeat, is that waterboarding violates our ideals and our values. I do believe that it is torture. I don't think that's just my opinion; that's the opinion of many who have examined the topic. And that's why I put an end to these practices. I am absolutely convinced it was the right thing to do, not because there might not have been information that was yielded by these various detainees who were subjected to this treatment, but because we could have gotten this information in other ways, in ways that were consistent with our values, in ways that were consistent with who we are.I was struck by an article that I was reading the other day talking about the fact that the British during World War II, when London was being bombed to smithereens, had 200 or so detainees. And Churchill said, We don't torture, when the entire British--all of the British people were being subjected to unimaginable risk and threat. And the reason was that Churchill understood, you start taking shortcuts, and over time, that corrodes what's best in a people; it corrodes the character of a country.And so I strongly believe that the steps that we've taken to prevent these kinds of enhanced interrogation techniques will make us stronger over the long term and make us safer over the long term, because it will put us in a position where we can still get information. In some cases, it may be harder, but part of what makes us, I think, still a beacon to the world is that we are willing to hold true to our ideals even when it's hard, not just when it's easy.At the same time, it takes away a critical recruitment tool that Al Qaida and other terrorist organizations have used to try to demonize the United States and justify the killing of civilians. And it makes us--it puts us in a much stronger position to work with our allies in the kind of international coordinated intelligence activity that can shut down these networks.So this is a decision that I am very comfortable with. And I think the American people, over time, will recognize that it is better for us to stick to who we are, even when we're taking on a unscrupulous enemy.Okay. I'm sorry.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct answer to the factual/opinion question: *“Do you believe that the previous administration sanctioned torture?”*  
   The expected response would be a clear “Yes, I believe they did” or “No, I do not believe they did,” possibly with brief justification.

2. **What the answer provides** – The interviewee talks at length about:
   - Waterboarding being torture and a violation of values.  
   - The decision to end “enhanced interrogation” techniques.  
   - Historical analogies (Churchill, WWII Britain).  
   - Arguments about preserving ideals, recruitment tools for terrorists, etc.  

   The response never states explicitly whether the speaker believes the *previous administration* sanctioned torture. It only implies that such techniques were used and that they were stopped, but it does not answer the specific yes/no query.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – Not satisfied; the answer does not explicitly answer the question.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – The answer does give some related content (it mentions ending torture practices), but it does not *refuse* to answer; rather, it *deflects* and provides a broader discussion.  
   - **Ambivalent** – The response is incomplete with respect to the asked question: it is partial, implicit, and amounts to a deflection rather than a direct answer. This matches the definition of an *ambivalent* response (the information is given in an incomplete, indirect, or dodging manner).

**Conclusion:** The interviewee’s reply is an incomplete, indirect answer that dodges the specific question, fitting the *Ambivalent* category.

79,Why not call for an emergency energy summit and lift the issue to a higher priority?,"Q. Mr. President, gas prices are high, as you know. Oil is at 75 a barrel. There is a poll that suggests that three in four Americans are not content with your leadership on the issue, and that the State of the Union pitch for alternative fuel technology has fallen flat and is not moving. Why not call for an emergency energy summit and lift the issue to a higher priority?","Well, I thought addressing the issue at the State of the Union was pretty much lifting it to a high priority. When you include it in the State of the Union, it means it's a top priority, and it is.It took us a while to get in a position where we're reliant upon sources of energy from outside our boundaries, and it's going to take us a while to become less dependent. It just takes a while; things just don't happen instantly. I told the people, if I could lower gasoline prices with a snap of the fingers, I'd do it. And I've been talking about energy independence since I first got elected. And we've made some progress. We made progress by encouraging the spread of ethanol. And I think if you were to look at the facts, that ethanol has gone from low market penetration to pretty significant market penetration in selected parts of the country, relatively speaking, particularly in the Midwest.There is more work to be done. There is a lot of ethanol plants being built as we speak, and there's incentives in Government law to do that. We've effected CAFE standards when it comes to light trucks, which will help consumers make a rational decision. We put incentives for people to buy hybrid vehicles in law. If you go out and buy a hybrid vehicle, you get a tax credit.I happen to believe it's essential for us to promote nuclear power as a way to make us less dependent on natural gas from overseas, for example. Also, this will help us be wise stewards of our environment. We're spending a lot of money on technologies, battery technologies, for example, that would enable Chicago residents to drive the first 40 miles on electricity before one would have to use gasoline.And so we do have a full-blown strategy to make this country less dependent on foreign sources of oil, to help relieve pressure at the gas pump. When the demand for crude oil in China rises, it affects the global price of crude oil, which affects your price of gasoline. And therefore, the strategy has got to be to diversify away from crude oil.One of the issues that we're trying to get done here is that if you—if people are genuinely concerned about the price of gasoline, they ought to be supporting my initiative to encourage the construction of additional refinery capacity. Certainly, it's not the long-term solution, but it's an important solution for the short run. If you have constrained gasoline supplies and demand remains high, you're going to have higher prices of gasoline. We haven't built a new refinery in this country since the early 1970s. And so the truth of the matter is, I would hope people would contact their Members of Congress to insist that they support a—the bill that we ran up to the Hill, which would have made it much easier to permit and construct refineries.So we have a comprehensive plan. This is a serious issue. I understand people are paying high gasoline prices here—it's like a tax. I understand it's like a tax. And we got a strategy to deal with it.Anna [Anna Kukec, Daily Herald].

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking for a direct response to a specific proposal: *Why not call for an emergency energy summit and elevate the issue to a higher priority?* The expected answer would explain the reasoning for (or against) that particular course of action.

2. **What the answer provides** – The interviewee does not address the proposal head‑on. Instead, they:
   - Re‑state that the issue was already “lifted to a high priority” by being mentioned in the State of the Union.
   - Offer a broad discussion of the administration’s overall energy strategy (ethanol, CAFE standards, nuclear power, battery tech, refinery capacity, etc.).
   - Explain general reasons for high gasoline prices and the need for diversification.
   - The answer never says “I will not call a summit” or “I have decided not to” nor does it explain why a summit is unnecessary; it merely deflects by describing existing actions.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – The response does **not** explicitly answer the question; it does not state a decision or rationale regarding an emergency summit.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – The answer does give substantive information (the administration’s energy strategy), so it is not a total non‑reply due to ignorance or refusal.  
   - **Ambivalent** – The response partially addresses the issue but does so incompletely and indirectly, offering a deflection rather than a direct answer. It is therefore an incomplete, somewhat evasive answer.

**Conclusion:** The interviewee’s reply is incomplete and deflects from the specific question, fitting the **Ambivalent** category.

80,Why would the international force not include U.S. troops?,"Q. Thanks. Mr. President, officials have been quoted saying that the international force would not include U.S. troops.

Is it because you're afraid that the U.S. doesn't have credibility in the region?","No, I think, first of all, there has been a history in Lebanon with U.S.troops. Secondly, I have said that if the international force would like some help with logistics and command and control, we'd be willing to offer logistics and command and control.

And I think command and control and logistical support is probably the best—is the best use of U.S. forces.Mike Fletcher [Washington Post].",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct explanation for why the international force would *not* include U.S. troops. The expected answer is a clear statement of the reason(s) behind that decision.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not evade the question. Instead, they explicitly state:
   - There is a historical context (U.S. troops in Lebanon) that influences the decision.
   - The United States is willing to provide logistics and command‑and‑control support rather than deploy combat troops.
   - Deploying U.S. troops could create a global perception that might hinder the mission’s objectives.
   - Troops are committed only for specific reasons that align with clear objectives, and logistical support is the “best use” of U.S. forces.

   These points directly answer the “why” question by giving concrete reasons for the exclusion of U.S. combat troops.

3. **Information type** – The requested information is **explicitly provided**. The interviewee lists specific reasons (historical experience, political perception, objective‑driven troop deployment) rather than offering a vague or partial response.

4. **Evasion or incompleteness?** – The answer is not a non‑reply; it does not refuse to answer, nor does it request clarification. It is not merely general or ambiguous—it supplies substantive justification, even if the phrasing is somewhat indirect.

**Conclusion:** The response fully addresses the question with explicit reasons, meeting the criteria for a *Clear Reply*.

The answer addresses that by saying there is history with US troops in Lebanon, and that they would offer logistics and command and control, and that committing troops would create a sensation that may not enable objective, so they commit troops for specific reasons. It does explain why US troops are not included: they prefer to provide support rather than troops, due to political sensitivities and objectives. It does give reasons, albeit somewhat indirect. It\'s not a clear, concise answer but it does provide reasons. It\'s not a non-reply (no answer). It\'s not ambiguous? It\'s somewhat indirect but does answer.

81,Can't you be accused of hyping this threat?,"Q. Mr. President, thank you. I'd like to follow on that. When you talked about Iraq, you and others in the administration talked about a mushroom cloud; then there were no WMD in Iraq. When it came to Iran, you said in October—on October 17th, you warned about the prospect of world war III, when months before you made that statement, this intelligence about them suspending their weapons program back in '03 had already come to light to this administration. So can't you be accused of hyping this threat? And don't you worry that that undermines U.S. credibility?","David, I don't want to contradict an august reporter such as yourself, but I was made aware of the NIE last week. In August, I think it was, John McConnell—Mike McConnell came in and said, We have some new information. He didn't tell me what the information was; he did tell me it was going to take a while to analyze. Why would you take time to analyze new information? One, you want to make sure it's not disinformation. You want to make sure the piece of intelligence you have is real. And secondly, they want to make sure they understand the intelligence they gathered. If they think it's real, then what does it mean? And it wasn't until last week that I was briefed on the NIE that is now public.And the second part of your question has to do with this: Look, was dangerous; is dangerous; and will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon. The NIE says that had a hidden—a covert nuclear weapons program. That's what it said. What's to say they couldn't start another covert nuclear weapons program? And the best way to ensure that there—that the world is peaceful in the future is for the international community to continue to work together to say to the ians, we're going to isolate you. However, there is a better way forward for the ians.Now, in 2003, the ian Government began to come to the table in discussions with the EU-3, facilitated by the United States. In other words, we said to the EU- 3, we'll support your efforts to say to the ians, you have a choice to make: You can continue to do policy that will isolate you, or there's a better way forward. And so that was the sticks-and-carrots approach.You might remember, the United States said at that point in time, we'll put the WTO on the table for consideration, or we'll help you with spare parts for your airplanes. It was all an attempt to take advantage of what we thought was a more openminded ian regime at the time— a willingness of this regime to talk about a way forward. And then the ians had elections, and Ahmadi-nejad announced that—to the IAEA that he was going to— this is after, by the way, the ians had suspended their enrichment program—he said, We're going to stop the suspension; we'll start up the program again. And that's where we are today.My point is, is that there is a better way forward for the ians. There has been a moment during my Presidency in which diplomacy provided a way forward for the ians. And our hope is we can get back on that path again. But what is certain is that if ever had the knowledge to develop a nuclear weapon and they passed that knowledge on to a covert program, which at one time in their history has existed, the world would be more dangerous. And now is the time for the international community to work together.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is directly challenging the speaker: *“Can’t you be accused of hyping this threat?”* The expected answer would be a clear acknowledgment or denial of that accusation, i.e., an explicit statement about whether the speaker believes they (or the administration) overstated the danger.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response does not give a straightforward yes/no or any explicit judgment on the charge of “hyping.” Instead, it:
   - Shifts the focus to the process of intelligence analysis (“I was made aware of the NIE…”, “We want to make sure it’s not disinformation…”).
   - Provides a broad narrative about Iran’s nuclear program, historical negotiations, and diplomatic strategy.
   - Ends with a vague statement about “a better way forward” without directly answering whether the speaker is “hyping” the threat.

3. **Information type** – The answer is **partial and implicit**. It touches on related themes (intelligence verification, past warnings, diplomatic options) but never explicitly states whether the speaker believes they are or are not hyping the threat. The core accusation remains unanswered.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker deflects the charge by discussing procedural details of intelligence assessment and historical policy choices rather than confronting the allegation head‑on. This is characteristic of an **ambivalent** response: the information is given, but it is incomplete, indirect, and does not fully satisfy the request.

**Conclusion:** The response is neither a full denial nor an explicit admission; it offers only a vague, indirect commentary that leaves the accusation unaddressed. Therefore it fits the **Ambivalent** category.

82,Asking about what has happened to America's clout in the region and why the actions and words of the President are being ignored.,"Q. Thank you. Mr. President, both of you, I'd like to ask you about the big picture that you're discussing. Mr. President, 3 years ago, you argued that an invasion of Iraq would create a new stage of Arab-Israeli peace. And yet today, there is an Iraqi Prime Minister who has been sharply critical of Israel. Arab governments, despite your arguments, who first criticized Hizballah, have now changed their tune; now they're sharply critical of Israel. And despite, from both of you, warnings to Syria and Iran to back off support from Hizballah, effectively, Mr. President, your words are being ignored. So what has happened to America's clout in this region that you've committed yourself to transform?","David, it's an interesting period because instead of having foreign policies based upon trying to create a sense of stability, we have a foreign policy that addresses the root causes of violence and instability.For a while, American foreign policy was just, let's hope everything is calm, kind of managed calm. But beneath the surface brewed a lot of resentment and anger that was manifested in its—on September the 11th. And so we've taken a foreign policy that says, on the one hand, we will protect ourselves from further attack in the short run by being aggressive and chasing down the killers and bringing them to justice— and make no mistake, they're still out there, and they would like to harm our respective peoples because of what we stand for— in the long term, to defeat this ideology, and they're bound by an ideology. You defeat it with a more hopeful ideology called freedom.And, look, I fully understand some people don't believe it's possible for freedom and democracy to overcome this ideology of hatred. I understand that. I just happen to believe it is possible, and I believe it will happen. And so what you're seeing is a clash of governing styles. For example, the notion of democracy beginning to emerge scares the ideologues, the totalitarians, those who want to impose their vision. It just frightens them, and so they respond. They've always been violent.I hear this amazing, kind of, editorial thought that says, all of a sudden, Hizballah has become violent because we're promoting democracy. They have been violent for a long period of time. Or Hamas— one reason why the Palestinians still suffer is because there are militants who refuse to accept a Palestinian state based upon democratic principles.And so what the world is seeing is a desire by this country and our allies to defeat the ideology of hate with an ideology that has worked and that brings hope. And one of the challenges, of course, is to convince people that Muslims would like to be free, that there's other people other than people in Britain and America that would like to be free in the world. There's this kind of almost—kind of—weird kind of elitism that says, well, maybe certain people in certain parts of the world shouldn't be free; maybe it's best just to let them sit in these tyrannical societies. And our foreign policy rejects that concept. We don't accept it.And so we're working. And this is—as I said the other day, when these attacks took place, I said this should be a moment of clarity for people to see the stakes in the 21st century. I mean, there's an unprovoked attack on a democracy. Why? I happen to believe because progress is being made toward democracies. And I believe that—I also believe that Iran would like to exert additional influence in the region. A theocracy would like to spread its influence using surrogates.And so I'm as determined as ever to continue fostering a foreign policy based upon liberty. And I think it's going to work unless we lose our nerve and quit. And this government isn't going to quit.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

2. **How the answer responds**  
   - The interviewee launches into a broad discourse about foreign policy, “root causes of violence,” “ideology of hate,” and “freedom vs. hatred.”  
   - The response touches on themes related to U.S. power (e.g., “we will protect ourselves…”, “defeat this ideology”), but it never explicitly states **what has happened to America’s clout** or **why the President’s warnings are being ignored**.

83,Has the U.S. reached out to Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You have reached out to both Sunni and Shi'a political leaders in recent weeks, and now there's word that the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani is supporting a moderate coalition in Iraq. Has the U.S. reached out to him? How important is he in the equation moving forward? And what do you say to people who say more troops in Iraq would increase the sectarian split and not calm things down?","Well, I haven't made up my mind yet about more troops. I'm listening to our commanders; I'm listening to the Joint Chiefs, of course; I'm listening to people in and out of Government; I'm listening to the folks on the Baker-Hamilton commission about coming up with a strategy that helps us achieve our objective. And so as I said to Caren—probably a little more harshly than she would have liked—hypothetical questions, I'm not going to answer them today. I'm not going to speculate out loud about what I'm going to tell the Nation, when I'm prepared to do so, about the way forward.I will tell you we're looking at all options. And one of those options, of course, is increasing more troops. But in order to do so, there must be a specific mission that can be accomplished with more troops. And that's precisely what our commanders have said, as well as people who know a lot about military operations. And I agree with them that there's got to be a specific mission that can be accomplished with the addition of more troops before I agree on that strategy.Secondly, whatever we do is going to help the Iraqis step up. It's their responsibility to govern their country. It's their responsibility to do the hard work necessary to secure Baghdad. And we want to help them.Thirdly, I appreciate the fact that the Prime Minister and members of the Government are forming what you have called a moderate coalition, because it's becoming very apparent to the people of Iraq that there are extremists and radicals who are anxious to stop the advance of a free society. And therefore, a moderate coalition signals to the vast majority of the people of Iraq that we have a unity government, that we're willing to reconcile our differences and work together and, in so doing, will marginalize those who use violence to achieve political objectives.And so we support the formation of the unity Government and the moderate coalition. And it's important for the leader Sistani to understand that's our position.

   - That “it’s important for the leader Sistani to understand that’s our position,” and that “he knows that we’re interested in defeating extremism.”
   
   The response never states whether any outreach to the Ayatollah has taken place. It only hints that the U.S. wishes him to understand its stance, which is a indirect, vague reference rather than an explicit answer.

3. **Assessing the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – Requires the requested information to be explicitly stated. The answer does **not** give a direct “yes” or “no” about outreach.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – Would apply if the respondent completely avoided the topic or said they don’t know. Here they do mention Sistani, but only in a peripheral, non‑committal way.  
   - **Ambivalent** – Fits when the answer provides the information only partially, implicitly, or by deflection. The response mentions Sistani and the desire for him to understand U.S. intentions, but it stops short of confirming any actual contact. This is an incomplete, indirect answer that dodges the precise question.

4. **Conclusion** – The reply offers a **partial, implicit reference** to Sistani without directly answering whether the U.S. has reached out. It therefore falls under the **Ambivalent** category.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a concrete answer: *where* the missile was headed (i.e., its target trajectory).

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The respondent does **not** state a target or trajectory. Instead, they:
   - Re‑state that they “still can’t give you any better answer than yesterday.”
   - Shift the focus to their own knowledge limits, to “modest” missile‑defense systems, and to the need for a ballistic‑missile system.
   - End with a vague comment that the answer “wasn’t satisfactory.”

3. **Information type** – The response is **incomplete** and **implicit**. It mentions the missile only in the abstract (“where it’s going”) but never provides the specific heading or target. The answer is more a deflection than a direct statement.

4. **Evasion check** – The speaker deliberately avoids giving the requested location, offering only general commentary and repeating that they cannot improve on yesterday’s answer. This is a classic case of dodging/deflection.

85,Why does the asker request Israel to accept United Nations resolutions related to the Palestinian problem in order to facilitate a solution and end the occupation?,"Q. I just asked, why you ask Israel to accept the United Nations resolutions related to the Palestinian problem just to facilitate the solution and to end the occupation?","Yes, actually, I'm asking Israel to negotiate in good faith with an elected leader of the Palestinian Territory to come up with a permanent solution that—look, the U.N. deal didn't work in the past. And so now we're going to have an opportunity to redefine the future by having a state negotiated between an elected leader of the Palestinian people as well as the Prime Minister of Israel. This is an opportunity to move forward. And the only way for—the only way to defeat the terrorists in the long run is to offer an alternative vision that is more hopeful. And that's what we're attempting to do, sir.We can stay stuck in the past, which will yield nothing good for the Palestinians, in my judgment. We can chart a hopeful future, and that's exactly what this process is intending to do: to redefine the future for the Palestinian citizens and the Israelis.I am confident that two democratic states living side by side in peace is in the interests not only of the Palestinians and the Israelis but of the world. The question is whether or not the hard issues can be resolved and the vision emerges so that the choice is clear amongst the Palestinians, the choice being, do you want this state, or do you want the status quo? Do you want a future based upon a democratic state, or do you want the same old stuff? And that's a choice that I'm confident if the Palestinian people are given, they will choose peace.And so that's what we're trying to do, sir. The settlement for us is considered an obstacle for negotiations. And we have spoke more than once with the—Mr. Prime Minister Olmert very frankly. And we also spoke in this meeting with President George Bush, and consequently, the President understood this issue. And we have heard the statements given by the Secretary of State, Dr. Rice, and she had her point of view regarding settlements was very positive.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a clear justification for why the asker is urging Israel to accept UN resolutions concerning the Palestinian issue in order to help solve the conflict and end the occupation. The answer should explicitly state the reason or purpose behind that request.

2. **What the answer provides** – The interviewee talks about:
   - Negotiating in good faith with an elected Palestinian leader.
   - The failure of past UN deals and the need to “redefine the future.”
   - Offering a hopeful alternative to terrorism.
   - The goal of two democratic states living in peace.
   - A choice for Palestinians between a new state and the status quo.
   - General references to conversations with Israeli leaders and U.S. officials.

   However, the response never directly states **why** the asker wants Israel to *accept UN resolutions*; it stays at a higher‑level discussion of negotiations, future vision, and peace, without linking those talks to the specific purpose of accepting UN resolutions.

3. **Is the information explicit?** – No. The answer is vague, general, and indirect. It does not give a concise, explicit statement such as “I ask Israel to accept UN resolutions because they provide an internationally recognised framework that can legitimize a negotiated settlement and pressure both sides to move toward a two‑state solution.”

4. **Is the answer a non‑reply?** – No. The interviewee does give a substantive, though indirect, response about the broader goals of the negotiation and the rationale behind seeking a new approach. So it is not a complete omission of information.

5. **Is the answer ambivalent?** – Yes. The response is incomplete with respect to the specific request; it offers partial, implicit, and somewhat deflective commentary rather than a clear, targeted explanation. It touches on related themes but stops short of directly answering the “why” of accepting UN resolutions.

86,Concern about triggering a wider Middle East war,"Q. Does the Beirut—the attack on the Beirut Airport, does that concern you, and are you concerned about triggering a wider Middle East war?","As I mentioned, my biggest concern is whether or not actions taken will weaken the Siniora Government. Democracy in Lebanon is an important part of laying a foundation for peace in that region. We have worked really hard to get Syria out of Lebanon—U.N. Resolution 1559 and its followup, Resolution 1680, were manifestations of the work of the international community to get Syria out of Lebanon. We've always felt that a democracy in Lebanon is important for the Lebanese people, and it's important for the region.So the concern is that any activities by Israel to protect herself will weaken that Government. And we have made that—or topple that Government—and we've made it clear in our discussions.Having said all that, people need to protect themselves. There are terrorists who will blow up innocent people in order to achieve tactical objectives. In this case, the objective is to stop the advance of peace— which is a remarkable statement, isn't it— willing to kill to stop peace.We have a good chance to get a two-state solution, two democracies living side by side in peace. It is a clear and achievable vision. There is a way forward called the roadmap to achieve that vision. What will prevent that vision from being achieved is—are terrorist activities, and that's what you're seeing taking place.Thank you all. Thank you.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct answer about whether the interviewee is worried that the attack on Beirut Airport could spark a broader war in the Middle East.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response talks about many related issues (the strength of the Siniora government, democracy in Lebanon, Israeli actions, terrorism, the roadmap to peace, etc.). It never explicitly states whether the speaker is concerned that the attack might trigger a wider war. The concern expressed is framed in terms of “weakening the government” and “terrorist activities,” not the specific fear of a regional escalation.

3. **Information type** – The answer provides only indirect, partial, and implicit references to the topic. It does not give a clear, explicit statement about the specific concern asked for.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker shifts the focus to broader political themes rather than answering the narrow question about triggering a wider war.

And we get over those difficulties, we resolve them, and we go to the next stage of this fight against terrorism for all the allies.At one stage 4 years ago, we had a war against them to dislodge them from Afghanistan, to remove them from being the Government of Afghanistan. And then there were major operations against them to arrest or to chase them out. And then we began to rebuild the country, to have roads, to have schools, to have health clinics, to have education, to have all other things that people need all over the world. And now we are at a stage of bringing more stability and trying to get rid of them forever. The desire is to do that sooner, but a desire is not always what you get. So it will take time, and we must have the patience to have the time spent on getting rid of them for good.On narcotics, it is a problem. It is an embarrassment to Afghanistan. And I told President Bush earlier in my conversation with him that we feel very much embarrassed for having narcotics growing in our country. But again, it has come to Afghanistan because of years of our desperation and lack of hope for tomorrow. I know Afghan families, ma'am, who destroyed their pomegranate orchards or vineyards to replace them with poppies because they did not know if they were going to have their children the next day, if they were going to be in their own country the next day, if they were going to be having their home standing the next day.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does **not** answer the hypothetical at all. Instead, the response:

89,Blame for a government shutdown,"Q. Thank you, sir. You've spoken extensively about the debt ceiling debate, but some Republicans have further said that they're willing to allow a Government shutdown to take place rather than put off deep spending cuts. Are you prepared to allow the Government to grind to a halt if you disagree with the spending cut proposals they put forth? And who do you think the American people would blame if that came to pass?","Well, ultimately, Congress makes the decisions about whether or not we spend money and whether or not we keep this Government open. And if the Republicans in Congress have made a decision that they want to shut down the Government in order to get their way, then they have the votes at least in the House of Representatives, probably, to do that.I think that would be a mistake. I think it would be profoundly damaging to our economy. I think it would actually add to our deficit because it will impede growth. I think it's shortsighted. But they're elected representatives, and folks put them into those positions, and they're going to have to make a decision about that. And I don'tI suspect that the American people would blame all of Washington for not being able to get its act together.But the larger issue here has to do with, well, what is it that we're trying to accomplish. Are we trying to reduce the deficit? Because if we're trying to reduce the deficit, then we can shape a bipartisan plan to reduce the deficit. I mean, is that really our objective? Our concern is that we're spending more than we take in, and if that's the case, then there's a way of balancing that out so that we take in more money, increasing revenue, and we reduce spending. And there's a recipe for getting that done.And in the conversations that I had with Speaker Boehner before the end of the year, we came pretty close; I mean, a few hundred billion dollars separating us when stretched out over a 10-year period, that's not a lot.But it seems as if what's motivating and propelling at this point some of the House Republicans is more than simply deficit reduction. They have a particular vision about what Government should and should not do. So they are suspicious about Government's commitments, for example, to make sure that seniors have decent health care as they get older. They have suspicions about Social Security. They have suspicions about whether Government should make sure that kids in poverty are getting enough to eat or whether we should be spending money on medical research. So they've got a particular view of what Government should do and should be.And that view was rejected by the American people when it was debated during the Presidential campaign. I think every poll that's out there indicates that the American people actually think our commitment to Medicare or to education is really important, and that's something that we should look at as a last resort in terms of reducing the deficit, and it makes a lot more sense for us to close, for example, corporate loopholes before we go to putting a bigger burden on students or seniors.But if the House Republicans disagree with that and they want to shut down the Government to see if they can get their way on it, that's their prerogative. That's how the system is set up. It will damage our economy.The Government is a big part of this economy, and it's interesting that a lot of times, you have people who recognize that when it comes to defense spending; some of the same folks who say we've got to cut spending or complain that Government jobs don't do anything, when it comes to that defense contractor in their district, they think, wow, this is a pretty important part of the economy in my district, and we shouldn't stop spending on that. Let's just make sure we're not spending on those other folks.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step reasoning**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants to know *who* the speaker believes the American public would blame if a government shutdown occurred because of partisan disagreement over spending cuts.

2. **What the answer provides** – The speaker explicitly states:

90, Is there anything you wish you would have done differently with regard to Iraq?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You spoke of the troubles in Iraq. And as you know, we have Woodward [Bob Woodward, Washington Post] and we have a shelf full of books about Iraq, and many of them claim that administration policies contributed to the difficulties there. So I'm wondering, is there anything you wish you would have done differently with regard to Iraq?","Speaking about books, somebody ought to add up the number of pages that have been written about my administration. There's a lot of books out there. A lot. I don't know if I've set the record or not, but I guess it means that I've made some hard decisions and will continue to make hard decisions.And, David, this is the—this is about the fifth time I've been asked this type of question. And as you know, there are some things that I wish had happened differently: Abu Ghraib. I believe that really hurt us. It hurt us internationally. It kind of eased us off the moral high ground. In other words, we weren't a country that was capable of, on the one hand, promoting democracy, and then treating people decently. Now the world has seen that we've held those to account who are—who did this.You know, there's just a lot of look-backs. Presidents don't get to look back, but I will tell you, the decision to remove Saddam was the right decision. And I would look forward to the debate where people debate whether or not Saddam should still be in power.As you know, a leader in the Senate Intel Committee on, I think it was CBS News, Axelrod, I'm not sure—you follow your news closely; you can verify this—said that the world would be better if Saddam were in power. I strongly disagree. So when it comes to that decision, which is a decision to cause a lot of people to write books, it's the right decision.And now the fundamental question is, will this country help this young democracy succeed? And the answer is, we will. We'll change tactics when we need to change tactics to help this young democracy succeed. But the stakes are high if we were to leave. It means that we would hand over a part of the region to extremists and radicals who would glorify a victory over the United States and use it to become—use it to recruit. It would give these people a chance to plot and plan and attack. It would give them resources from which to continue their efforts to spread their caliphate.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct answer to whether the speaker regrets any specific actions or decisions concerning Iraq, i.e., “Is there anything you wish you would have done differently with regard to Iraq?”

2. **How the answer addresses it** –  
   - The speaker does mention a regret (“Abu Ghraib… it hurt us internationally”) and therefore does answer the core of the question.  
   - However, the response quickly shifts to a defense of the decision to remove Saddam, a broader discussion of books and page counts, and a forward‑looking statement about helping democracy succeed.  
   - The answer is therefore not a concise, straightforward “yes, I wish I had done X” or “no, I have no regrets.” It mixes acknowledgement of a regret with extensive deflection and justification.

3. **Information type** – The response provides **partial** information: it does give a concrete example of something the speaker wishes had been different (Abu Ghraib), but it does not give a clear, complete answer to the question; instead it veers into unrelated commentary and justification.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker uses the opportunity to discuss other topics (books, page counts, future strategy) rather than delivering a focused, unambiguous answer. This makes the reply **incomplete** and **implicit** rather than fully explicit.

5. **Classification decision** – Because the answer supplies some relevant information but does so in a **partial, implicit, and somewhat evasive** manner, it fits the definition of an **Ambivalent** response.

91,The potential complications in keeping pressure on Iran's sanctions at the United Nations,"Q. Mr. President, to go back to Iran for a minute, the Non-Proliferation Treaty doesn't prohibit a country like Iran from having the knowledge to enrich uranium. Are you setting a different standard in this case and a different international obligation on Iran? And is that going to complicate the efforts to keep the pressure on when it comes to sanctions at the United Nations?","The problem that most of the world has seen in stems from the fact that they hid their program. That's what the NIE says. The '68 agreement that signed contemplated full transparency and openness. They didn't contemplate a regime that would have a covert nuclear weapons program, all the more reason for the international community to continue to work together. If somebody hid their program once, they could hide it again. If somebody defied the agreement that they signed, the codicils of the agreement they've signed, they could do it again. And most of the world understands that with a nuclear weapon would be a serious danger to peace, and therefore, now is the time to work together to convince them to suspend their program.People say, Would you ever talk to ? For you veterans here, for those who have been following this administration for a while, you might remember that I have consistently said that we will be at the table with the EU-3 if would verifiably suspend their program, and the offer still stands.What changed was the change of leadership in . In other words, we had a diplomatic track going, and Ahmadi-nejad came along and took a different tone. And the ian people must understand that the tone and actions of their Government are that which is isolating them. There's a better way forward for . There's a better way forward for the ian people than one in which they find themselves isolated in the world. Their economy can be stronger. But their leadership is going to have to understand that defiance and hiding programs and defying IAEA is not the way forward.And my hope is, is that the ian regime takes a look at their policies and changes their policies back to where we were prior to the election of Ahmadi-nejad, which was a hopeful period. They had suspended their program; they were at the table. The United States had made some very positive gestures to convince them that there was a better way forward. And hopefully, we can get back to that day.Bret [Bret Baier, FOX News].",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct assessment of *how* the situation might make it harder to maintain UN‑level pressure on Iran through sanctions.

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee talks about Iran’s hidden nuclear program, the need for transparency, the importance of international cooperation, and the change in tone under the new leadership. The response mentions that defiance “isolates” Iran and that the international community must work together, but it never explicitly states *what the complications are* for maintaining sanctions pressure. Instead, it offers a broad discussion of Iran’s behavior and policy changes.

3. **Information provided** – The answer is **partial and implicit**. It touches on related themes (e.g., isolation, defiance, need for cooperation) but does not spell out the specific complications the question asks about. It shifts focus to Iran’s actions rather than answering the question about the mechanics of UN sanctions pressure.

4. **Evasion or deflection?** – Yes. The response sidesteps the precise query and instead gives a generalized commentary on Iran’s conduct and the broader diplomatic context.

**Conclusion:** The response does not give a clear, explicit answer to the question; it provides only a vague, indirect discussion of related issues.

**Classification:** **Ambivalent**

92,Or have you and Musharraf worked out some deal about this already?,"Q. Mr. President, if you had actionable intelligence about the whereabouts of top Al Qaida leaders in Pakistan, would you wait for Musharraf's permission to send in U.S. forces, even if it meant missing an opportunity to take them out?

We're in constant communications with the Pakistan Government. It's in their interest that foreign fighters be brought to justice. After all, these are the same ones who were plotting to kill President Musharraf. We share a concern. And I'm confident, with real, actionable intelligence, we will get the job done. When President Musharraf visits Afghanistan on the 9th of August to inaugurate the joint Pakistan-Afghanistan convention, or jirga, together with me, we will be discussing further improvements and relations between the two countries. The two countries are neighbors; they've been having extensive relationships with each other. We will be discussing improvement of those relations, on all aspects of them. We will also be discussing the possible outcome of the joint jirga between the two countries and how effectively, then, we can carry on the fight against terrorism in both countries and in the region as a result of that jirga. So it's a—it's going to be, I'm sure, a good meeting, ma'am.Afghan press?",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking a direct, yes‑or‑no‑type question: *“Or have you and Musharraf worked out some deal about this already?”*  
   The expected answer would be a clear statement confirming or denying that any such arrangement has been made.

2. **What the answer actually does** – The interviewee’s response talks about:
   - Confidence in actionable intelligence and cooperation with the Pakistani government.  
   - General statements about shared concerns and upcoming meetings.  
   - Discussion of bilateral relations and a forthcoming “joint jirga.”  

   The reply never says **yes** or **no** about whether a specific deal has already been worked out. It stays at a high level of generality and shifts the focus to future meetings rather than addressing the substance of the question.

3. **Does the answer provide the requested information?** – No. The core request—whether a deal has been struck—remains unanswered. The response is vague, indirect, and effectively sidesteps the question.

4. **Which classification fits?**  
   - **Clear Reply** – Not applicable; the answer does not explicitly state the requested fact.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – This would apply if the interviewee simply refused to answer or said “I don’t know.” Here the interviewee does answer, but the answer is incomplete and evasive.  
   - **Ambivalent** – This category covers answers that are **incomplete, partial, implicit, or deflecting**—exactly what occurs here. The response gives related information (cooperation, upcoming talks) but does not directly answer the question, leaving the query only partially addressed.

**Conclusion:** The response is incomplete and deflects from the specific question, fitting the **Ambivalent** category.

93,"What other areas do you believe you're building a record of transformation in, apart from Iraq, that you hope will last the ages?","Q. I've just two questions related to the amazing fact that a quarter of your Presidency lies ahead. First, I keep reading that you'll be remembered only for Iraq, and I wonder what other areas you believe you're building, a record of transformation you hope will last the ages. And second, a followup on Julie's question, what is your plan for either changing your role or keeping control of the agenda at a time when Democrats have both Houses on the Hill, and when the '08 candidates are doing their thing?","Well, one is to set priorities. That's what I've just done, setting a priority. My message is: We can work together. And here are some key areas where we've got to work together, reauthorization of No Child Left Behind, minimum wage. I hope we're able to work together on free trade agreements. We can work together on Social Security reform and Medicare reform, entitlement reform. We need to work together on energy, immigration, earmarks.The leadership has expressed their disdain for earmarks; I support their disdain for earmarks. I don't like a process where it's not transparent, where people are able to slip this into a bill without any hearing or without any recognition of who put it in there and why they put it in there. It's just not good for the system, and it's not good for building confidence of the American people in our process or in the Congress.The first part of the—oh, last 2 years. I'm going to work hard, Michael. I'm going to sprint to the finish, and we can get a lot done. And you're talking about legacy. Here—I know—look, everybody is trying to write the history of this administration even before it's over. I'm reading about George Washington still. My attitude is, if they're still analyzing number 1, 43 ought not to worry about it and just do what he thinks is right and make the tough choices necessary.We're in the beginning stages of an ideological struggle, Michael. It's going to last a while. And I want to make sure this country is engaged in a positive and constructive way to secure the future for our children. And it's going to be a tough battle.I also believe the Medicare reform—the first meaningful, significant health care reform that's been passed in a while—is making a huge difference for our seniors. No Child Left Behind has been a significant education accomplishment, and we've got to reauthorize it. We have proven that you can keep taxes low, achieve other objectives, and cut the deficit. The entrepreneurial spirit is high in this country, and one way to keep it high is to keep—let people keep more of their own money.So there's been a lot of accomplishment. But the true history of any administration is not going to be written until long after the person is gone. It's just impossible for short-term history to accurately reflect what has taken place. Most historians, you know, probably had a political preference, and so their view isn't exactly objective—most short-term historians. And it's going to take a while for people to analyze mine or any other of my predecessors until down the road when they're able to take—watch the long march of history and determine whether or not the decisions made during the 8 years I was President have affected history in a positive way.I wish you all a happy holiday.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants the interviewee to name *other* domains (aside from Iraq) in which the administration believes it is creating a lasting, transformative record.

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee explicitly lists a series of policy areas:
   - Reauthorization of *No Child Left Behind* (education)  
   - Raising the *minimum wage*  
   - Advancing *free‑trade agreements*  
   - *Social Security* and *Medicare* reform / entitlement reform  
   - *Energy* policy, *immigration* policy, and reform of *earmarks*  
   - General statements about “working together” and “legacy”  

   These are concrete topics that directly answer the request for “other areas … that you hope will last the ages.”

3. **Is the information explicit?** – Yes. The answer spells out the specific sectors the speaker considers part of a lasting record. While the response is broad and includes some rhetorical flourishes, it does not dodge or remain vague about the named domains; it names them outright.

4. **Is it a non‑reply?** – No. The interviewee does not refuse to answer, claim ignorance, or ask for clarification. The response does address the question.

5. **Is it ambivalent?** – Not really. Ambivalent would imply the answer is incomplete, indirect, or only partially addresses the query. Here the answer fully enumerates the areas requested, even if it also adds surrounding commentary. The core request is answered explicitly.

**Conclusion:** The response provides the requested information in an explicit, though somewhat expansive, manner.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The speaker does not give a clear, targeted message to frustrated Americans. Instead, the response:

   - Mentions talking to President Putin and the need for a common goal, but never directly addresses “what to say to Americans.”
   - Provides broad, abstract statements about diplomatic solutions and the importance of a nuclear‑free peninsula, which are only tangentially related to the question.

3. **Information type** – The answer is **partial and implicit**. It touches on related themes (sanctions, China/Russia, economic interests) but never explicitly answers the specific query about messaging to frustrated Americans. It is therefore not a complete or direct response.

That's part of the problem. We're dealing with a person who was asked not to fire a rocket by the Chinese, the South Koreans, the United States, the Japanese, and the Russians. And he fired seven of them, which then caused the Secretary of State and myself to get on the phone with our partners and reminded them that—of the importance of speaking with one voice.It's to—saying to Kim Jong Il, there is a better way forward for you than isolating yourself from the rest of the world; that there is a opportunity for you to stick to some of your agreements, and that is to verifiably disarm; and that there will be a better life than being isolated and, most importantly, a better life for your people than isolation will bring.And so I was on the phone this morning with Hu Jintao and President Putin, and last night I talked to Prime Minister Koizumi and President Roh. And my message was that we want to solve this problem diplomatically, and the best way to solve the problem diplomatically is for all of us to be working in concert and to send one message, and that is—to Kim Jong Il—that we expect you to adhere to international norms, and we expect you to keep your word.One way to send a message is through the United Nations. And the Japanese laid down a resolution which we support. But we're working with our partners to make sure we speak with one voice. Diplomacy takes a while, particularly when you're dealing with a variety of partners. And so we're spending time diplomatically making sure that voice is unified.I was pleased from the responses I got from the leaders. They, like me, were— are concerned, concerned about a person who doesn't seem to really care about what others say. And so we're working it, working it hard. And it's—and by the way, an effective policy is one which is not just the United States trying to solve problems. So I spent time talking to the Canadian Prime Minister about it. I mean, Canada is a, should be, and must be an active participant in helping deal with problems.He brought up Haiti, for example, in the Oval Office.

Isn't this just a matter of kicking the can down the road, in the twilight of both of your terms, to a new U.S. administration that may or may not even support it?And, President Putin, what would it take for you to be convinced that such a system would not be a threat to Russian security? And how would Russia respond if the U.S. went ahead with this anyway, as well as bringing Ukraine and Georgia into NATO?","I think I just explained how far we have come on this issue. This is a concept that I talked to Vladimir about a while ago, and we have come a long way. Read the document, and read what it says. It clearly talks about a strategic relationship. It talks about the need for transparency and confidence-building measures. It is a really good opportunity to put a framework in place for our nations to work together.Now, you can cynically say, it's kicking the can down the road. I don't appreciate that, because this is an important part of my belief that it's necessary to protect ourselves. And I have worked—reached out to Vladimir Putin. I knew this was of concern to him, and I have used my relationship with him to try to get something in place that causes Russia to be comfortable with it.Is it going to happen immediately? No, it's not going to happen immediately. But is this a good opportunity to work together? You bet it is—for the common good. And so I feel comfortable with it, and I think it is—you know, I happen to believe it is a significant breakthrough, simply because I've been very much involved with this issue and know how far it's come. What could convince Russia that this system is not aimed against our nation? I would like to point out several elements here. First, the first—the best thing to do is to work jointly on a global missile defense, with an equal, democratic-style access to managing such a system. This is what George was just talking about when he said that, at the technological level, certain exchanges made it possible— information exchange may be possible. We can work jointly if we launch such joint work with equal democratic access to managing the system. This will be the best guarantee of the security of all.If we fail to do it at this point, then we will insist that the system, the transparency that we talk about, verification matters, could be objective and could work on—could function on an ongoing basis, on a permanent basis, with the help of experts that should be present at those sites on a permanent basis. This is the answer to the first part of your question.As far as NATO enlargement is concerned, we talked about it at length earlier today. I reaffirmed Russia's position on this count. I believe that in order to improve relations with Russia, it is necessary not to pull the former Soviet republics into political/military blocs, but to develop relations with Russia itself. And then the actions of the bloc, of this or that issue, in a few years will not be perceived so acutely in this country, as is the case today.As far as enlargement is concerned, technical enlargement of NATO, I believe that this is a policy which is in conformity with a former, old logic, when Russia was perceived as an adversary, which is no longer the case today.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not give a straightforward “yes” or “no” to the accusation. Instead, they:
   - Re‑assert that progress has been made and that the issue has been discussed with Vladimir Putin.
   - Emphasize that the document outlines a “strategic relationship,” transparency, and confidence‑building measures.
   - Reframe the criticism as a cynical view they reject, calling the effort a “significant breakthrough.”
   - Offer a justification about joint management and verification, but never directly answers whether the statement is merely a postponement.

3. **Information provided** – The response is **partial and indirect**. It touches on the substance of the accusation (the timeline, the need for Russian comfort) but does so in a vague, defensive manner, without explicitly stating whether the project is being delayed or how the administration intends to secure Russian support.

4. **Evasion vs. clarity** – Because the answer avoids a clear, explicit reply to the specific allegation and instead offers a general defense, it falls into the category of **ambivalent** – the information is given, but incompletely and with deflection.

**Conclusion:** The response is **Ambivalent**.  

**LABEL:** Ambivalent","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to that specific question.

98,"What do you say to the argument that your proposal is basically seeking support for torture, coerced evidence, and secret hearings?","Q. Thank you very much, sir. What do you say to the argument that your proposal is basically seeking support for torture, coerced evidence, and secret hearings? And Senator McCain says your plan will put U.S. troops at risk. What do you think about that?","This debate is occurring because of the Supreme Court's ruling that said that we must conduct ourselves under the Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention. And that Common Article Three says that there will be no outrages upon human dignity. It's very vague. What does that mean, outrages upon human dignity? That's a statement that is wide open to interpretation. And what I'm proposing is that there be clarity in the law so that our professionals will have no doubt that that which they are doing is legal. You know, it's—and so the piece of legislation I sent up there provides our professionals that which is needed to go forward.The first question that we've got to ask is, do we need the program? I believe we do need the program. And I detailed in a speech in the East Room what the program has yield—in other words, the kind of information we get when we interrogate people within the law. You see, sometimes you can pick up information on the battlefield; sometimes you can pick it up through letters; but sometimes you actually have to question the people who know the strategy and plans of the enemy. And in this case, we questioned people like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who we believe ordered the attacks on 9/11, or Ramzi bin al-Shibh or Abu Zubaydah, coldblooded killers who were part of planning the attack that killed 3,000 people. And we need to be able to question them, because it helps yield information, information necessary for us to be able to do our job.Now, the Court said that you've got to live under Article 3 of the Geneva Convention, and the standards are so vague that our professionals won't be able to carry forward the program, because they don't want to be tried as war criminals. They don't want to break the law. These are decent, honorable citizens who are on the frontline of protecting the American people, and they expect our Government to give them clarity about what is right and what is wrong in the law. And that's what we have asked to do.And we believe a good way to go is to use the amendment that we worked with John McCain on, called the Detainee Treatment Act, as the basis for clarity for people we would ask to question the enemy. In other words, it is a way to bring U.S. law into play. It provides more clarity for our professionals, and that's what these people expect. These are decent citizens who don't want to break the law.Now, this idea that somehow we've got to live under international treaties, you know—and that's fine; we do; but oftentimes the United States Government passes law to clarify obligations under international treaty. And what I'm concerned about is if we don't do that, then it's very conceivable our professionals could be held to account based upon court decisions in other countries. And I don't believe Americans want that. I believe Americans want us to protect the country, to have clear standards for our law enforcement, intelligence officers, and give them the tools necessary to protect us within the law.It's an important debate, Steve. It really is. It's a debate that really is going to define whether or not we can protect ourselves. I will tell you this: I've spent a lot of time on this issue, as you can imagine, and I've talked to professionals, people I count on for advice; these are people that are going to represent those on the frontline of protecting this country. They're not going forward with the program. They're not going—the professionals will not step up unless there's clarity in the law. So Congress has got a decision to make: Do you want the program to go forward or not?I strongly recommend that this program go forward in order for us to be able to protect America.Hillman.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct response to two accusations:  
   a) that the interviewee’s proposal amounts to seeking support for **torture, coerced evidence, and secret hearings**; and  
   b) Senator McCain’s claim that the plan would **put U.S. troops at risk**. The expected answer would be a clear statement either defending the proposal or acknowledging the concerns.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not directly answer either accusation. Instead, the response:
   - Shifts the discussion to the **Supreme Court’s interpretation of Common Article 3** of the Geneva Convention.  
   - Complains that the language is “vague” and that professionals need **clarity** to avoid being “tried as war criminals.”  
   - Describes the proposed legislation (the Detainee Treatment Act) as a way to give that clarity.  
   - Mentions specific detainees and the need to question them, but never explicitly says “my proposal does **not** seek torture” or “the claim about troops is unfounded.”

3. **Information type** – The answer is **partial and implicit**. It touches on related themes (need for legal clarity, concern for service members) but does not give a straightforward rebuttal or affirmation of the accusations. The response is therefore **incomplete** with respect to the specific question asked.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker largely **deflects** the charge by talking about procedural and legal‑clarity issues rather than addressing the allegation that the plan “seeks support for torture, coerced evidence, and secret hearings.” This is characteristic of an **ambivalent** reply.

**Conclusion:** The response provides only a vague, indirect, and incomplete answer to the question; it does not clearly state a position on the accusations. Hence it falls under the **Ambivalent** category.

1. **What the question asks:**  
   The interviewer wants a concrete answer about the specific type of punishment the interviewee would like to see imposed on North Korea, *excluding* a UN Security Council condemnation.

   The interviewee replies with only the word “Okay.” There is no description, suggestion, or elaboration of any punishment. The response does not address the substance of the question at all.

3. **Evaluation against the classification categories:**  
   - **Clear Reply:** The answer does **not** explicitly state the requested information.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply:** The information requested is **not given at all**; the respondent simply acknowledges the question without providing any substantive content. This matches the definition of a “Clear Non‑Reply.”  
   - **Ambivalent:** The answer is not merely incomplete or vague; it is essentially empty, offering no partial or implicit response.

And we also believe that it's going to be very important that this first resolution lay a very quick foundation for passage of a second resolution.

And obviously, the parties have views on how to stop this. Their views are not going to necessarily be consonant about how to stop it. The international community has a view, but, of course, we're going to take a little time and listen to the concerns of the parties and see how they can be addressed.But I want to just note, we believe that the extant draft resolution is a firm foundation, is the right basis, but, of course, we're going to listen to the concerns of the parties and see how they might be addressed.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct judgment about the speaker’s feeling (disappointment) regarding the Iraqi unity government’s progress in reconciling sectarian and ethnic groups.

2. **How the answer responds** –  
   - The speaker begins with a simple “No,” which technically answers the yes/no format, but the answer does **not** explain *why* there is no disappointment.  
   - The remainder of the response veers into a broad discussion of extremists, a “plan,” security measures, troop movements, and the importance of the democracy, without ever addressing the specific issue of disappointment with the government’s reconciliation efforts.  
   - The answer is vague, general, and deflects from the core question, offering only indirect, unrelated commentary.

3. **Information provided** – The response is **partial and implicit**; it does not clearly state the speaker’s sentiment about the government’s progress, nor does it elaborate on the disappointment (or lack thereof) in any concrete way.

4. **Classification decision** – Because the answer gives only a brief, non‑explanatory “No” and then shifts to unrelated topics, it falls into the category where the requested information is **incomplete, indirect, and deflecting**.

102, Willingness to take action in order to prevent a similar outcome as in 1992.,"Q. Mr. President, bad economic news continues to pile up, the latest today, with the GDP barely growing. Are you concerned that a sagging economy and hard times will help defeat John McCain like it did your father in 1992? And how far are you willing to go to prevent that?","I'm concerned about the economy because I'm concerned about working Americans, concerned about people who want to put money on the table and save for their kids' education. That's why I'm concerned about the economy. I want Americans working.And there's no question, the economy has slowed down. You just cited another example of slowdown. I don't think we're headed to a recession, but no question, we're in a slowdown. And that's why we acted, and acted strongly, with over $150 billion worth of progrowth economic incentives, mainly money going into the hands of our consumers and some money going to incent businesses to invest, which will create jobs.And so we've acted robustly. And now it's time to determine whether or not this progrowth package will actually work. Now the checks will start going out in the second week of May. There are going to be letters out soon explaining who is eligible for the refunds. Credit will happen in the first week of May. In other words, some people will choose to have their bank accounts credited. And in the second week of May, we anticipate the checks start moving out of Washington.And the purpose is to encourage our consumers. The purpose is to give them money—their own to begin with, by the way—but give them money to help deal with the adverse effects of the decline in housing value. Consumerism is a significant part of our GDP growth. And we want to sustain the American consumer, encourage the American consumer, and at the same time, we want to encourage investment. So we'll see how the plan works.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response talks about:
   - Concern for the economy and the need to help working Americans.  
   - Past actions taken (a $150 billion stimulus, checks, credits).  
   - A statement that “we’ll see how the plan works,” implying uncertainty about future steps.

   The answer **does not explicitly state** whether the speaker is willing to take *additional* action beyond what has already been done, nor does it directly answer the “how far are you willing to go” part of the question. It merely describes what has been done and hints at future evaluation.

3. **Information type** – The response is **partial and implicit**. It provides related context (past stimulus, concern for the economy) but stops short of a definitive answer about future willingness. It is neither a full refusal nor a complete non‑answer; it is an incomplete, somewhat evasive reply.

Security Council resolution that we can table next week. And secondly, it's really important for people to understand that terrorists are trying to stop the advance of freedom, and therefore, it's essential that we do what's right and not necessarily what appears to be immediately popular.There's a lot of suffering in Lebanon because Hizballah attacked Israel. There's a lot of suffering in the Palestinian Territory because militant Hamas is trying to stop the advance of democracy. There is suffering in Iraq because terrorists are trying to spread sectarian violence and stop the spread of democracy. And now is the time for the free world to work to create the conditions so that people everywhere can have hope.And those are the stakes; that's what we face right now. We've got a plan to deal with this immediate crisis. It's one of the reasons the Prime Minister came, to talk about that plan. But the stakes are larger than just Lebanon.Isn't it interesting, that when Prime Minister Olmert starts to reach out to President Abbas to develop a Palestinian state, militant Hamas creates the conditions so that there's crisis, and then Hizballah follows up? Isn't it interesting, as a democracy takes hold in Iraq, that Al Qaida steps up its efforts to murder and bomb in order to stop the democracy?And so one of the things that the people in the Middle East must understand is that we're working to create the conditions of hope and opportunity for all of them. And we'll continue to do that, Tom. That's— this is the challenge of the 21st century. It's very obvious what the strategy of terrorism is, and of the actions that Hizballah took. Their strategy is to commit an outrage that provokes a reaction and then on the back of the reaction, to mobilize extreme elements and then try and create a situation which even moderate people feel drawn to their cause. That's the strategy.And you, quite rightly, say, Well, isn't there a danger that the Arab street and people in Arab Muslim countries become more sympathetic to Hizballah as a result of what's happened? That is their strategy. How do we counter it? We counter it, one, by having our own strategy to bring the immediate crisis to an end, which we do. That is what is important about the Secretary of State visiting the region, getting an agreement, tabling it to the United Nations, getting the endorsement of the United Nations, having an international stabilization force to move into the situation. We've got to deal with the immediate situation.But then, as the President was saying a moment or two ago, we've then got to realize what has happened in the past few weeks is not an isolated incident. It is part of a bigger picture. Now, I'm going to say some more things about this in the days to come, but we really will never understand how we deal with this situation unless we understand that there is a big picture out in the Middle East which is about reactionary and terrorist groups trying to stop what the vast majority of people in the Middle East want, which is progress towards democracy, liberty, human rights, the same as the rest of us.Now, that's the battle that's going on. And, yes, it is always very difficult when something like this happens, as it has happened over the past few weeks. So we've got to resolve the immediate situation, but we shouldn't be in any doubt at all, that will be a temporary respite unless we put in place the longer-term framework.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct assessment of the risk that continued fighting will widen the conflict because support for Hizballah is growing among both Shi’a and Sunni Arab populations.

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee does not give a clear, explicit answer to that risk. Instead, the response:
   - Shifts to talking about “instructions” for the Secretary of State,
   - Provides a broad, generalized discourse about terrorism, suffering, and the “strategy of terrorism,”
   - Describes the strategy of Hizballah in abstract terms,
   - Mentions the need to “bring the immediate crisis to an end” and to “create conditions of hope,” but never states whether there is a concrete risk of a wider war or quantifies it.

3. **Information provided** – The answer is **partial and implicit**. It touches on related themes (the strategy of Hizballah, the potential for escalation) but does so in a vague, deflecting manner, without directly addressing the specific question about the risk of a wider war.

4. **Classification decision** – Because the response offers some related content but does **not** give a clear, explicit answer to the asked‑about risk, it falls into the category of an **Ambivalent** reply—information is given incompletely and indirectly, constituting a deflection rather than a straightforward answer.

**LABEL: Ambivalent**","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to the specific question: ""Risk of wider war due to growing support for Hizballah"".

105,"How close are we to a stock exchange crash, and what measures have you taken so that it does not affect the real economy?","Q. Good afternoon. This question is to the three leaders. The stock exchange mar-kets—the stock markets have gone through a severe crisis in recent weeks. How close are we to a stock exchange crash, and what measures have you taken so that it does not affect the real economy?So when you will be presenting your first report, there's an opposition party that wants to prevent this—what is the outlook in your view? What's the outlook? And do you trust—do you believe that the opposition will accept your invitation for a dialog?","Well, to answer the first question, there's the financial problem, which is quite delicate in several markets. What I can tell you in relation to the case of Mexico, fortunately, our financial system has been solid enough to resist these critical times. I know that many central banks in several parts of the world, the European Union, the Federal Reserve in the U.S., and other central banks, have applied considerable resources in order to bring liquidity to their financial and banking systems.Now, fortunately, in the case of Mexico, this has not been necessary. The financial system and the banking system is very solid. It took us a lot of work, a lot of money to have such a solid system that would resist situations like this, but fortunately, it has not required the support of liquidity from the Central Bank of Mexico.Currently, the Mexican Stock Exchange has adjusted fixed income values. This is the case throughout the world. However, the Mexican Stock Exchange was one of the five that actually had an increase in its value throughout the world last year, over 50 percent. And obviously, the reduction that we're seeing is somehow or another a form of a correction, which will actually improve the health of the financial markets in Mexico.Could it have an impact in the real economy? Well, that depends on the scope of the situation, how it affects the markets, particularly the North American markets, which affects us most. My belief is that the situation is beginning to stabilize. And it will depend on the impact that it might have on the growth of the U.S., which, as you know, Mexico depends on this growth, on the U.S. growth.Now, in relation to the second subject, the second issue, I have invited legislators. I'm a democrat that believes in the basic ideas and that believes in constructing dialog, and this is what I'm seeking in Congress, constructive dialog. Unfortunately, I still haven't received a positive answer from this—in relation to this invitation, but I believe, I trust that in the future, there will be greater willingness to talk about issues of concern for all Mexicans.I know it's another system, Canada is, but Prime Minister Harper has to talk to his Parliament just about every day, every week. And I think—I would say that we would—I would very much like to have an institutional way in Mexico so that we're able to work and to talk about what we agree with and what we don't agree with in our country. I'll be willing to talk to anybody that wants to talk to me, particularly within Congress.Now, in relation to the attitude of the PRD or other members of that party, I respect them, and of course, I appeal to the sense of responsibility towards the country. And I hope that maturity will prevail and common sense too. So the only thing that will be lost with this is that anybody that breaks the basic laws of our institutional life—let's say that citizens know very well and recognize the maturity and the responsibility of political parties, and the people of our country are able to punish these attitudes too. Our monetary and financial systems that monitor it are following it closely. But naturally, there are certain differences in their assets and liabilities, and some of the major corporations will have drops in their stocks. That is the normal course. But I can assure you that the capital situation of our major corporations, our financial institutions, of our individual persons are very strong.[.]Our economic and financial institutions that are responsible for watching these markets are monitoring them closely. At the same time, just to remind people, it's normal for the price of assets of various securities or companies or whatever to go up and down in the marketplace. It's not unusual. I can assure you that the position of Canadian financial sector, in particular our banks, Canadian companies in general, and the household sector, our capital positions are very strong. The fundamentals of the U.S. economy are strong. Inflation is down; interest rates are low; the employment picture is strong; exports are up. We grew at over 3 percent in the second quarter. The fundamental question is, is there enough liquidity in our system as people readjust risk? And the answer is, yes, there is.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks**  
   - It requests two concrete pieces of information:  
     a) *How close* the market is to a crash.  
     b) *What measures* have been taken to prevent that crash from harming the real economy.

2. **What the answer provides**  
   - The speaker discusses the *state* of Mexico’s financial system, notes that it is “solid enough to resist” the crisis, mentions that no liquidity support was needed, and says the situation is “beginning to stabilize.”  
   - He also describes general actions taken by other central banks and the Mexican Stock Exchange’s recent performance.  
   - However, he never gives a clear, explicit assessment of *how close* a crash is; the closeness is described only in vague, conditional terms (“the situation is beginning to stabilize… it will depend on the impact on the U.S.”).  
   - While he does outline some measures (solid financial system, no need for liquidity), he does so in a general, indirect way rather than directly answering the “what measures have you taken” part with a concise list.

3. **Evaluation against the classification categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – The answer does **not** explicitly state a concrete closeness rating (e.g., “we are X days away from a crash”) nor does it give a straightforward, complete list of measures.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – The answer **does** provide some relevant information (the financial system’s resilience, stabilization trends, and general preventive steps). It is not a total refusal or ignorance.  
   - **Ambivalent** – The response is **partial and incomplete**: it touches on the requested topics but leaves the key question (“how close are we to a crash?”) unanswered and offers only a vague, indirect assessment. This matches the definition of an *ambivalent* answer—information is given but in an incomplete, somewhat evasive manner.

**Conclusion:** The response is best classified as **Ambivalent**. It supplies some related information but fails to fully address the specific questions asked, leaving the answer incomplete and somewhat deflecting.

106,"Why did you keep saying that there was a relationship between Saddam Hussein, Zarqawi, and Al Qaida despite the report stating there was no link?","Q. Mr. President, you have said throughout the war in Iraq and building up to the war in Iraq that there was a relationship between Saddam Hussein and Zarqawi and Al Qaida. A Senate Intelligence Committee report a few weeks ago said there was no link, no relationship, and that the CIA knew this and issued a report last fall. And yet a month ago, you were still saying there was a relationship. Why did you keep saying that? Why do you continue to say that? And do you still believe that?","The point I was making to Ken Herman's [Austin American-Statesman] question was that was a state sponsor of terror and that Mr. Zarqawi was in Iraq. He had been wounded in Afghanistan, had come to Iraq for treatment. He had ordered the killing of a U.S. citizen in Jordan. I never said there was an operational relationship. I was making the point that had been declared a state sponsor of terror for a reason, and therefore, he was dangerous.The broader point I was saying, I was reminding people was why we removed from power. He was dangerous. I would hope people aren't trying to rewrite the history of ; all of a sudden, he becomes kind of a benevolent fellow. He's a dangerous man. And one of the reasons he was declared a state sponsor of terror was because that's what he was. He harbored terrorists; he paid for families of suicide bombers. Never have I said that gave orders to attack 9/11. What I did say was, after 9/11, when you see a threat, you've got to take it seriously. And I saw a threat in , as did Congress, as did the .

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct explanation for why the interviewee continued to assert a link between Saddam Hussein, Zarqawi and Al Qaeda even after a Senate Intelligence Committee report found no such relationship.

2. **How the answer addresses the question** –  
   - The response does not give a clear, concise reason for “keeping saying” the claim.  
   - Instead, it shifts focus to general statements about Saddam being a “state sponsor of terror,” about Zarqawi’s presence in Iraq, and about the broader justification for removing Saddam.  
   - It explicitly says “I never said there was an operational relationship,” which sidesteps the accusation of maintaining a false link.  
   - The answer provides context and justification but does not directly answer the “why did you keep saying that?” query.

3. **Information type** – The answer is **partial and indirect**. It offers some related information (e.g., that Saddam was a state sponsor of terror, that Zarqawi was in Iraq) but it **does not explicitly answer** the question about the motive for persisting with the claim. The response is therefore incomplete with respect to the specific request.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The reply deflects from the core query and leaves the asked‑for explanation unsaid, fitting the definition of an **ambivalent** response (incomplete, implicit, or deflecting).

107,Do you believe America's corporations are not making enough money these days?,"Q. Mr. President, are you considering a plan to cut corporate taxes? Do you believe America's corporations are not making enough money these days?","Actually, we had an interesting discussion on this subject. And if you read carefully the penetrating reporter by the financial reporter—kind of, like, semi-financial reporter—[]—you'll find that it was—I was talking about an idea that has begun to surface as a result of meetings being held at the Treasury Department.And the whole reason to look at corporate rates is to determine whether or not they make us less competitive in a global economy. And if so—in other words, if the conclusion is, is that our tax structure makes it harder for businesses to compete, therefore making it harder for people to find work over time, then we need to address the competitive imbalance in our Tax Code.I also made it clear that we're at the very early stages of discussion and that, in my own judgment, anything that would be submitted to Congress—if submitted at all—would have to be revenue neutral. And therefore, what we'd really be talking about is a simplification of a very complex Tax Code that might be able to lower rates and, at the same time, simplify the code, which is, like, shorthand for certain deductions would be taken away—in other words, certain tax preferences in the code.My view all along has been, the more simple the code, the better, whether it be in the individual income tax side or the corporate tax side. However, I would readily concede to you this is a difficult issue, because the reason there is tax preferences in the first place are there are powerful interests that have worked to get the preference in the code. And as I remarked to the distinguished group of writers I was talking to yesterday, it's much easier to get something in the code than get it out of the code.But I do think it's in the interests to constantly evaluate our competitive advantages and disadvantages. And what Hank Paulson told me was that there's a lot of folks who really believe the Tax Code creates a competitive disadvantage, and therefore, it's certainly worth looking at.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct judgment on whether the speaker believes “America’s corporations are not making enough money these days.” The expected answer would be a clear yes or no (or an explicit statement of belief).

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The speaker launches into a discussion of tax policy, corporate tax rates, competitiveness, and the need for tax‑code simplification. While the passage mentions “making it harder for businesses to compete” and “the Tax Code creates a competitive disadvantage,” it never explicitly states a belief about whether corporations are currently earning insufficient profits. The response is indirect and avoids a straightforward answer.

3. **Information type** – The answer provides only partial, implicit information related to the topic (tax competitiveness) but does not give the requested assessment of corporate profitability. It is therefore incomplete with respect to the question’s demand.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker sidesteps the direct query by shifting to a broader policy discussion rather than answering the profitability question head‑on.

**Conclusion:** The response does not give a clear, explicit answer; it offers only a vague, indirect comment that is insufficient to fully answer the question. This fits the definition of an **Ambivalent** response.

1. **What the question asks:**  
   The interviewer wants a factual update on Fidel Castro’s current health condition.

2. **What the answer provides:**  
   - The speaker says Cuba is “not a very transparent society,” so the only information available is speculation.  
   - He states that “he’s very ill” and “going to be coming out of a hospital,” but then immediately says, “I don’t know. I really don’t know.”  
   - No concrete, verifiable details about Castro’s health are given; the speaker explicitly admits ignorance.

   - **Clear Reply:** The answer does **not** explicitly state the condition (e.g., “He is in critical condition”).  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply:** The requested factual information is **not given**; the speaker says they have no knowledge and only offers vague speculation. This matches the definition of a *Clear Non‑Reply*—the information is absent because of ignorance.  
   - **Ambivalent:** The response is not merely incomplete or partially informative; it outright refuses to provide any substantive answer.

**Conclusion:** The response is a *Clear Non‑Reply* with respect to the question about Fidel Castro’s current condition.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct judgment: *Is the speaker’s decision to work with Congress now an admission that the courts’ rulings (that he overstepped his authority) are correct facts?* The answer should be a clear “yes” or “no,” or an explicit statement acknowledging or denying that the willingness is an acknowledgment.

2. **How the answer responds** –  
   - The speaker talks about believing the district‑court ruling was flawed and that the matter is on appeal.  
   - He explains that the Supreme Court told him to “work with Congress,” and therefore they are doing so “to add certainty to the program.”  
   - He does **not** say whether his willingness to work with Congress is an acknowledgment that the courts’ findings are factual. Instead, he frames the collaboration as a response to the Court’s instruction, while still asserting his own belief that the ruling was flawed.

3. **Information provided** – The response offers related context (the Court’s instruction, the speaker’s belief, the need for congressional involvement) but **does not directly answer** the yes/no question. It sidesteps the core query and leaves the asked‑for acknowledgment unaddressed.

4. **Classification decision** – Because the answer is **partial and indirect**, providing some relevant background but failing to give a clear, explicit acknowledgment (or denial), it fits the “Ambivalent” category: the information is given incompletely, in a way that is somewhat evasive or deflecting.

110,"Based on the visit to the United States and the discussions with President Bush regarding cotton subsidies, have things evolved since then?","Q. Hi, I'm from the Beninese national radio. Mr. President, since you have been in power, you have done trips to the United States and Benin. Last time, you discussed with President Bush of the issue of cotton, American subsidies to their farmers in that country. And we saw with which enthusiasm you tackled this issue because, indeed, cotton is one of the pillars of the Beninese economy. So based on this visit, and up until today, have these things evolved? But is the issue of cotton still a sensitive issue?","I must confess that when we started these discussions, we on purpose did not talk about this, because the President asked us, What is your country ailing of? And I didn't bring up cotton. It's he himself who asked: What about this cotton business? What's going on with cotton? And I thanked him profusely for that.So, of course, he shared his vision with us, and he is encouraging us to diversify the sources of solutions to the problem that we have today, namely the cotton industry. He is aware that in our subregion—when we, for example, look at West Africa, and you add Central Africa to that, and a— one citizen out of two lives out of that industry. So I do believe of the workers in Burkina Faso and Mali, Niger and Togo, elsewhere, Senegal—and quite naturally, I think of my compatriots who commit themselves everyday that gives them into this line of business.So, Mr. President, I was expecting that the press would indeed bring up this issue because anybody who decides to fight on behalf of Africa against poverty cannot be— allow the cotton industry to deteriorate or to disappear. I do believe that there's a strong correlation between the health of the cotton industry and the prosperity of our countries.So you indeed gave us some advice. I could repeat some of this advice. He said, Do everything you can to bring added value. That's his first piece of advice. And he asked us to translate this into a vision, and this vision must also be part of a political vision and of a strategy. And I answered him, You are perfectly right. We ourselves—this was the direction that we have chosen for ourselves. But we are limited by various constraints, such as the shortcomings of some of our infrastructure, which are indispensable.For example, electricity: I even told him that electricity for the textile industry is basically what blood is for the human body. That we do have basic issues, basic shortcomings, in terms of energy, electricity, water, and so on, truly, and if you could help us in that regard. And he told me to—recommend to talk to OPIC, in terms of the United States, and to create a partnership between the private and public sectors to allow us to move ahead.And I reassured him, and I told him that this issue is being discussed within the communities that we have—ECOWAS—so that we can indeed come up with a subregional strategy, because our countries, taken alone, cannot do anything by themself, especially when you look at the difference in the Asian countries, in terms of their textile agencies. And practically no country in the world can compete against them.So of course, the President did not fail to follow up this question that I asked him when I was at the White House, namely the issue of subsidies. I think you are, indeed, right. Of course, he believed that this was an American issue, and that it's not even at his level that the core issue is being discussed—it's at the Senate; it's in Congress—and that in reality, his concern is to ensure that these efforts towards other countries—in order to resume the Doha cycle. It's through that Doha cycle that we'll come up with a solution. And he said, If Europe moves, if China moves, and if everyone else moves this, America moves. And I said, You're absolutely right. But there's one other issue, because when we talked about—with European leaders, they told me, Well, if America moves, we Europeans, we will move ourselves. So—and he says, Now, if Europe moves, well, we will move.So since the America is the great America, I do hope that great America will move, because I wrote to him when this issue was being debated in Congress. And I told him, truly, please intervene personally to ensure that the United States will indeed be the first to make the move.So today I applaud the fact that he did remember my request, but he did say you can count on him personally, on great America, to ensure that the Doha round will resume. And of course, we will come up with a solution to this—of world governance—to ensure that international trade can truly help the development of the poorest countries, of which we are.So that's where we are. That's in the update. I would like to thank him very much, because he was the first one, personally, to ask this question. Yes, I brought it up because it was on his mind. And look, the way to solve this issue is for the Doha round to succeed. And the United States has made moves on agricultural subsidies at the—during the negotiations. As a matter of fact, the talks were stalled earlier in my Presidency, and I gave a speech that said, we're going to move on subsidies, and we expect others to, but we'll take the first step—and have.And so we'll see what happens. These are serious negotiations, but our attitude is, is that we're willing to reduce agricultural subsidies. We just want to have access to people's markets, just like they've got to our markets. And I told the President I was fairly optimistic that we can succeed with the Doha round, and we'll keep working it.I also said that commodities—whether the United States has subsidies or not, commodities—cotton can be overproduced. There's a lot of cotton producers. And so the best way to deal with commodity swings is to be a value-added processor; take the cotton and convert it into a product people want. And that's why we got into the discussion about electricity needs and, you know, is there investment capital available. And now it's in Washington, DC, that OPIC has got some expanded programs that he ought to look into. So it was a good discussion.Ann [Ann Compton, ABC News].",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It wants a clear assessment of whether, since the earlier U.S. visit and the discussion with President Bush about cotton subsidies, any concrete progress or change has occurred.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not give a simple “yes” or “no.”  
   - He recounts that cotton was raised, that the President asked about it, and that he thanked him.  
   - He then describes the President’s advice (diversify solutions, add value, partner with OPIC, etc.).  
   - He mentions ongoing constraints (energy, infrastructure) and that the issue is being discussed within ECOWAS to develop a sub‑regional strategy.  
   - He does not explicitly state whether the situation has improved; he only outlines what is being done and the challenges that remain.

3. **Information type** – The response is **partial and implicit**. It touches on the topic and hints at continued work, but it stops short of a definitive evaluation of “evolution.” The answer is therefore not a full, explicit reply, nor is it a complete non‑reply; it is an incomplete, somewhat evasive answer.

4. **Conclusion** – Because the information requested (a clear assessment of whether things have evolved) is given only in a vague, partial, and indirect manner, the appropriate classification is **Ambivalent**.

You've said that bilateral talks didn't work. Secretary Baker has said that maybe they should be considered, maybe at some point under certain conditions. Are you prepared now to just take the possibility of one-one-one talks with North Korea off the table?","I'm saying as loud as I can and as clear as I can that there is a better way forward for North Korea, and that we will work within the context of the six-party talks.People say, You don't talk to North Korea. We had a representative, a United States representative at the table in the six-party talks. The North Korean leader knows our position. It's easy to understand our position: There is a better way forward for his Government. And people need to review the September '05 document, the joint statement that talked about economics, and we won't attack North Korea. We agreed that we shouldn't have nuclear weapons on the peninsula. I mean, there is a way forward for the leader in North Korea to choose. We've made our choice, and so has China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia. And that's what's changed.I also am deeply concerned about the lives of the citizens in that country. I mean there's—and that's why I named a envoy, Jay Lefkowitz, to talk about the human condition inside of North Korea. And the reason we did that is we care about how people live. We care about people starving. We care about the fact that there are large concentration camps.You know, one of the most meaningful moments of my Presidency came when a Japanese mother came to the Oval Office to talk about what it was like to have her daughter kidnaped by North Korea. You can imagine what that was like. It broke my heart, and it should break everybody's heart. But it speaks to the nature of the regime.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct answer to a yes/no‑style query: *Is the administration ruling out one‑on‑one talks with North Korea?*  
   The expected response would be a clear statement such as “We are not ruling them out” or “We are ruling them out.”

2. **What the answer provides** – The interviewee launches into a broad policy explanation:
   - Talks about a “better way forward” for North Korea.  
   - Mentions working “within the context of the six‑party talks.”  
   - Refers to past documents and regional partners.  
   - Shifts to humanitarian concerns and personal anecdotes.  
   - Ends with “Let’s see here. Mark …” (a cue to the next reporter).

   The reply never says explicitly whether the possibility of one‑on‑one talks is being taken off the table. It offers context, deflects, and leaves the question unanswered.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – Not satisfied; the answer does not explicitly state the requested position.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – The answer does give some related information (it discusses the broader diplomatic framework), so it is not a total silence or refusal.  
   - **Ambivalent** – The response is incomplete, vague, and deflects from the specific yes/no request, providing only partial, implicit information about the stance.

1. **What the question asks:**  
   The interviewer asks a straightforward yes/no‑type question: *“Do you like them?”* The expected response would be an explicit statement indicating whether the interviewee likes “them” (e.g., “Yes, I like them,” or “No, I don’t like them”).

2. **What the answer provides:**  
   The interviewee replies, *“They may be a little too fancy for you.”*  
   - This does **not** say “yes” or “no.”  
   - It offers a vague, indirect comment about the subject being “too fancy,” which could be interpreted as a subtle criticism or a non‑committal remark, but it never directly addresses the question of whether the speaker *likes* them.  
   - The response is therefore **partial and implicit**; it hints at an opinion without giving a clear affirmative or negative answer.

3. **Evaluation against the classification categories:**  
   - **Clear Reply:** Requires the requested information to be explicitly stated. The answer is not explicit about liking; it only makes a vague observation. → **Not a Clear Reply.**  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply:** Would apply if the interviewee gave no answer at all (e.g., “I don’t know,” or remained silent). Here, some content is provided, albeit indirect. → **Not a Clear Non‑Reply.**  
   - **Ambivalent:** Encompasses answers that are incomplete, general, implicit, or deflecting. The response fits this description: it is a vague, indirect comment that does not directly answer the question but does touch on the subject. → **Matches Ambivalent.**

Thank you, sir. Even after hearing that one of the major conclusions of the National Intelligence Estimate in April was that the Iraq war has fueled terror growth around the world, why have you continued to say that the Iraq war has made this country safer?And to President Karzai, if I might, what do you think of President Musharraf's comments that you need to get to know your own country better when you're talking about where terror threats and the Taliban threat is coming from?","Do you want to start? Go ahead, please. [] I, of course, read the key judgments on the NIE. I agree with their conclusion that because of our successes against the leadership of Al Qaida, the enemy is becoming more diffuse and independent. I'm not surprised the enemy is exploiting the situation in Iraq and using it as a propaganda tool to try to recruit more people to their murderous ways.Some people have guessed what's in the report and have concluded that going into Iraq was a mistake. I strongly disagree. I think it's naive. I think it's a mistake for people to believe that going on the offense against people that want to do harm to the American people makes us less safe. The terrorists fight us in Iraq for a reason: They want to try to stop a young democracy from developing, just like they're trying to fight this young democracy in Afghanistan. And they use it as a recruitment tool, because they understand the stakes. They understand what will happen to them when we defeat them in Iraq.You know, to suggest that if we weren't in Iraq, we would see a rosier scenario with fewer extremists joining the radical movement requires us to ignore 20 years of experience. We weren't in Iraq when we got attacked on September the 11th. We weren't in Iraq, and thousands of fighters were trained in terror camps inside your country, Mr. President. We weren't in Iraq when they first attacked the World Trade Center in 1993. We weren't in Iraq when they bombed the . We weren't in Iraq when they blew up our Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. My judgment is, if we weren't in Iraq, they'd find some other excuse, because they have ambitions. They kill in order to achieve their objectives.You know, in the past, Usama bin Laden used Somalia as an excuse for people to join his jihadist movement. In the past, they used the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It was a convenient way to try to recruit people to their jihadist movement. They've used all kinds of excuses.This Government is going to do whatever it takes to protect this homeland. We're not going to let their excuses stop us from staying on the offense. The best way to protect America is defeat these killers overseas so we do not have to face them here at home. We're not going to let lies and propaganda by the enemy dictate how we win this war.Now, you know what's interesting about the NIE? It was a intelligence report done last April. As I understand, the conclusions—the evidence on the conclusions reached was stopped being gathered on February—at the end of February. And here we are, coming down the stretch in an election campaign, and it's on the front page of your newspapers. Isn't that interesting? Somebody has taken it upon themselves to leak classified information for political purposes.I talked to John Negroponte today, the DNI. You know, I think it's a bad habit for our Government to declassify every time there's a leak, because it means that it's going to be hard to get good product out of our analysts. Those of you who have been around here long enough know what I'm talking about. But once again, there's a leak out of our Government, coming right down the stretch in this campaign, to create confusion in the minds of the American people, in my judgment, is why they leaked it.And so we're going to—I told the DNI to declassify this document. You can read it for yourself. We'll stop all the speculation, all the politics about somebody saying something about Iraq, somebody trying to confuse the American people about the nature of this enemy. And so John Negroponte, the DNI, is going to declassify the document as quickly as possible. He'll declassify the key judgments for you to read yourself. And he'll do so in such a way that we'll be able to protect sources and methods that our intelligence community uses. And then everybody can draw their own conclusions about what the report says.Thank you.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

115,Or do you feel that he has traveled too far and too fast?,"Q. Mr. President, you've talked about the need for robust action on your country's deficit and debt positions. Do you agree with the Prime Minister's supporters that he led the way on the issue, or do you feel that, in fact, he has traveled too far and too fast?And could I just ask you both, as a sidebar, this time last year, we talked about the case of computer hacker Gary McKinnon, on which the Prime Minister has expressed very clear views. You said you would work together to find a solution. So have you found one?","Well, on your second question, Mr. McKinnon, we have proceeded through all the processes required under our extradition agreements. It is now in the hands of the British legal system. We have confidence in the British legal system coming to a just conclusion. And so we await resolution and will be respectful of that process.With respect to how we deal with debt and deficits, I said 2 years ago, the first time I came here, in April of 2009, the first G-20 summit that I attended, that each country is different and each country is going to have to make a range of decisions about how to--at that time--dig our way out of the worst recession that we'd experienced since the 1930s, at the same time that we put our countries on a path of sustainable growth that ultimately results in jobs and prosperity for our people and a growing middle class across the board.And we've succeeded in the first part, which is to yank the world economy out of recession, and that was in large part due to concerted action between the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries.Now we've got that other challenge, which is how do we sustain growth in a way that's responsible and responsive to the needs of our people. That requires us to continue to make investments in education, science, technology, infrastructure, things that help our economies grow. But it also means governments that live within their means.And obviously, the nature and role of the public sector in the United Kingdom is different than it has been in the United States. The pressures that each country are under from world capital markets are different. The nature of the debt and deficits are different. And as a consequence, the sequencing or pace may end up being different.But the one thing that I'm absolutely clear about is David and I want to arrive at the same point, a point in which we're making sure that our governments are doing what they need to do to ensure broad-based prosperity, but doing so in a responsible way that doesn't mortgage our futures and leave a mountain of debt to future generations.And the other point I think David and I would agree on is that this is going to be a constant process of trying some things, making adjustments. There are going to be opportunities for us to make investments. There are going to be other areas where we think those were good ideas at the time, programs that were started with the best of intentions, and it turns out they're not working as well as they should. If a program is not working well, we should get rid of it and put that money into programs that are working well. It means that we've got to make sure that we take a balanced approach and that there's a mix of cuts, but also thinking about how do we generate revenue so that there's a match between money going out and money coming in.And each country is going to have to go through what is a difficult and painful process. What I'm confident about is that we're going to be able to come out of this stronger than we were before. And I think that both the people of the United Kingdom and the people of the United States want to see a government that's reflective of their values, the fact that they take their responsibilities seriously, they pay their bills, they make sure that their families are cared for, they make sacrifices where necessary in order to ensure that their children and their grandchildren are succeeding. And they want those same values reflected in their government, and I think that both our countries are going to be able to achieve that. Thank you. First of all, in the case of Gary McKinnon, I mean, I understand the widespread concern about this case, and it's not so much about the alleged offense, which everyone knows is a very serious offense; it's about the issue of the individual and the way they're treated and the operation of the legal system and, as the President said, making sure that legal system operates properly and carefully.The case is currently in front of the Home Secretary, who has to consider reports about Gary's health and his well-being, and it's right that she does that in a proper and effectively quasi-judicial way.I totally understand the anguish of his mother and his family about this issue. We must follow the proper processes and make sure this case is dealt with in the proper way. And I'm sure that that is the case.On the issue of deficit reduction, I mean, I remember when we also spoke about this at the G-20, but even before that, when you first came here when you were running as a candidate. And I completely agree with Barack that each country is different and has different circumstances. I mean, Britain does not have a reserve currency. We're not in the same position as the U.S. with the dollar. And I think it was necessary for us to set out on the path of deficit reduction without delay after the election.And I would argue the proof of that for the U.K. has been what has happened in capital markets. And as the President just said, capital markets treat different countries differently. Well, in the European context, what you've seen since the election is actually market interest rates in the U.K., bond yields effectively come down. Whereas you look at what's happened in Greece or in Portugal or other European countries, you've often seen those bond rates increase. That, in my view, is the risk we would have run if we had not set out on the path of deficit reduction.But each country is different, but when I look across now and see what the U.S. and the U.K. are currently contemplating for the future, it's actually a relatively similar program in terms of trying to get on top of our deficits and make sure that debt is falling as a share of GDP. Because as the President said, we, in the end, share a very similar set of values about not wanting to load responsibility for these debts on our children and not wanting to shirk our own responsibilities for straightening out our own public finances.So, as he said, we may take slightly different paths, but we want to end up in the same place. It's an extremely difficult thing to have to do--dealing with your public finances, getting on top of your deficit--but it's absolutely essential. And we've talked a lot today about national security. In the end, there's no national security unless you have economic security. And that's an argument that we have to make and win every day here in the United Kingdom. Christi Parsons [Chicago Tribune], last question.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

   - This requires a clear stance (yes, he has; no, he hasn’t; or some nuanced opinion).

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee talks broadly about:
   - Differences in debt and deficit situations between countries.  
   - The need for “sequencing or pace” to be different.  
   - A general commitment to “arrive at the same point” and to “make adjustments.”  

   The response never states outright whether the Prime Minister “has traveled too far and too fast.” It only hints that the pace may vary and that adjustments will be made, without giving a definitive judgment.

3. **Information type** – The answer is **incomplete** and **implicit**. It offers a general discussion of pace and sequencing but stops short of answering the specific yes/no query. It is therefore not a clear, explicit reply.

I've just two questions related to the amazing fact that a quarter of your Presidency lies ahead. First, I keep reading that you'll be remembered only for Iraq, and I wonder what other areas you believe you're building, a record of transformation you hope will last the ages. And second, a followup on Julie's question, what is your plan for either changing your role or keeping control of the agenda at a time when Democrats have both Houses on the Hill, and when the '08 candidates are doing their thing?","Well, one is to set priorities. That's what I've just done, setting a priority. My message is: We can work together. And here are some key areas where we've got to work together, reauthorization of No Child Left Behind, minimum wage. I hope we're able to work together on free trade agreements. We can work together on Social Security reform and Medicare reform, entitlement reform. We need to work together on energy, immigration, earmarks.The leadership has expressed their disdain for earmarks; I support their disdain for earmarks. I don't like a process where it's not transparent, where people are able to slip this into a bill without any hearing or without any recognition of who put it in there and why they put it in there. It's just not good for the system, and it's not good for building confidence of the American people in our process or in the Congress.The first part of the—oh, last 2 years. I'm going to work hard, Michael. I'm going to sprint to the finish, and we can get a lot done. And you're talking about legacy. Here—I know—look, everybody is trying to write the history of this administration even before it's over. I'm reading about George Washington still. My attitude is, if they're still analyzing number 1, 43 ought not to worry about it and just do what he thinks is right and make the tough choices necessary.We're in the beginning stages of an ideological struggle, Michael. It's going to last a while. And I want to make sure this country is engaged in a positive and constructive way to secure the future for our children. And it's going to be a tough battle.I also believe the Medicare reform—the first meaningful, significant health care reform that's been passed in a while—is making a huge difference for our seniors. No Child Left Behind has been a significant education accomplishment, and we've got to reauthorize it. We have proven that you can keep taxes low, achieve other objectives, and cut the deficit. The entrepreneurial spirit is high in this country, and one way to keep it high is to keep—let people keep more of their own money.So there's been a lot of accomplishment. But the true history of any administration is not going to be written until long after the person is gone. It's just impossible for short-term history to accurately reflect what has taken place. Most historians, you know, probably had a political preference, and so their view isn't exactly objective—most short-term historians. And it's going to take a while for people to analyze mine or any other of my predecessors until down the road when they're able to take—watch the long march of history and determine whether or not the decisions made during the 8 years I was President have affected history in a positive way.I wish you all a happy holiday.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a concrete description of the interviewee’s strategy regarding (a) whether he will change his role and (b) how he intends to retain control of the legislative agenda given that Democrats control both houses and the 2008 candidates are active.

2. **What the answer contains** – The interviewee talks broadly about:
   - Setting priorities (e.g., reauthorizing No Child Left Behind, minimum‑wage, free‑trade agreements, entitlement reform, energy, immigration, earmarks).
   - Working with the leadership and “sprinting to the finish.”
   - A philosophical stance that history will judge later and that he will do what he thinks is right.
   - General statements about achievements and the need for long‑term perspective.

   However, the response never explicitly states a plan for *changing his role* or *maintaining control of the agenda* under the new Democratic control of Congress. It stays at a high‑level, vague level of “working together” and “priorities,” without addressing the specific political mechanics or intentions mentioned in the question.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – The answer does **not** give a direct, explicit statement of the requested plan.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – The answer does provide substantive, related content (priorities, cooperation, “sprinting to the finish”), so it is not a total non‑reply.  
   - **Ambivalent** – The response is **partial and indirect**; it touches on the topic but leaves the core question unanswered, offering only generalities and deflection.

4. **Conclusion** – The answer is incomplete and indirect with respect to the specific request, fitting the definition of an **Ambivalent** response.

**LABEL: Ambivalent**","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to that specific question. The question: ""What is your plan for either changing your role or keeping control of the agenda at a time when Democrats have both Houses on the Hill, and when the \'08 candidates are doing their thing?""

117,What led you to that conclusion?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. It was reported earlier this week that in a meeting with conservative journalists, you said you'd seen changes in the culture. You referred to it as a Third Awakening. I wonder if you could tell us about—what you meant by that, what led you to that conclusion? And do you see any contradictory evidence in the culture?","No, I said—Mike, thanks. I was just speculating that the culture might be changing, and I was talking about when you're involved with making decisions of historic nature, you won't be around to see the effects of your decisions. And I said that when I work the ropelines, a lot of people come and say, Mr. President, I'm praying for you—a lot. As a matter of fact, it seems like a lot more now than when I was working ropelines in 1994. And I asked them—I was asking their opinion about whether or not there was a Third Awakening, I called it.I'd just read a book on Abraham Lincoln, and his Presidency was right around the time of what they called the Second Awakening, and I was curious to know whether or not these smart people felt like there was any historical parallels. I also said that I had run for office the first time to change a culture—Herman and Hutch remember me saying, you know, the culture that said, If it feels good, do it, and if you've got a problem, blame somebody else—to helping to work change a culture in which each of us are responsible for the decisions we make in life. In other words, ushering in a responsibility era. And I reminded people that responsibility means, if you're a father, love your child; or if you're corporate America, be honest with the taxpayers; if you're a citizen of this country, love your neighbor.And so I was wondering out loud with them. It seems like to me that something is happening in the religious life of America. But I'm not a very good focus group either. I'm encapsulated here. I'm able to see a lot of people, and from my perspective, people are coming to say, I'm praying for you. And it's an uplifting part of being the President; it inspires me. And I'm grateful that a fellow citizen would say a prayer for me and Laura.Anyway, thank you all very much.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants to know the *reason* or *basis* for the interviewee’s claim that there is a “Third Awakening” in the culture. In other words, “What led you to that conclusion?”

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee does not give a concise, direct statement of the evidence or reasoning. Instead, he:
   - Mentions that he was “just speculating.”
   - Refers to reading a book on Abraham Lincoln and looking for historical parallels.
   - Describes observing people praying for him and Laura, and how that seemed more frequent than in 1994.
   - Talks about his earlier effort to change a cultural attitude (“If it feels good, do it…”) and his desire to usher in a “responsibility era.”
   - Concludes that “something is happening in the religious life of America,” but also notes he is “not a very good focus group” and is “encapsulated here.”

3. **Is the information explicit?** – The answer does touch on some of the factors that led him to the conclusion (reading Lincoln’s biography, observing prayerful messages, historical analogies). However, these points are presented in a rambling, indirect way, mixing personal anecdotes with broader cultural observations. The response is therefore **partial and implicit** rather than a clear, straightforward statement of the conclusion’s basis.

4. **Is the answer a non‑reply?** – No. The interviewee does provide some explanation; he does not simply refuse to answer or say “I don’t know.” He does give reasons, albeit in a diffuse manner.

5. **Is the answer ambivalent?** – Yes. The response supplies **incomplete, somewhat vague, and partially indirect** information about what led him to his conclusion. It meets the definition of an *ambivalent* answer: the requested information is given, but it is **too general, partial, and implicit**, involving deflection and digression rather than a crisp, explicit justification.

**Conclusion:** The appropriate classification is **Ambivalent**.  

**LABEL: Ambivalent**","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to ""What led you to that conclusion?"" The answer is a long ramble.

118,Do you agree with the Republican leader in the House that Democrats are more interested in protecting terrorists than protecting the American people?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd also like to ask an election-related question. The Republican leader in the House this week said that Democrats—he wonders if they are more interested in protecting the terrorists than protecting the American people. Do you agree with him, sir? And do you think that's the right tone to set for this upcoming campaign, or do you think he owes somebody an apology?","I wouldn't have exactly put it that way. But I do believe there's a difference of attitude. I mean, take the PATRIOT Act, for example—an interesting debate that took place, not once, but twice, and the second time around there was a lot of concern about whether or not the PATRIOT Act was necessary to protect the country. There's no doubt in my mind we needed to make sure the PATRIOT Act was renewed to tear down walls that exist so that intelligence people could serve— could share information with criminal people. It wasn't the case, Mark, before 9/11.In other words, if somebody had some intelligence that they thought was necessary to protect the people, they couldn't share that with somebody who's job it was to rout people out of society to prevent them from attacking. It just made no sense. And so there was a healthy debate, and we finally got the PATRIOT Act extended after it was passed right after 9/11. To me, it was an indication of just a difference of approach.No one should ever question the patriotism of somebody who—let me just start over. I don't question the patriotism of somebody who doesn't agree with me; I just don't. And I think it's unwise to do that. I don't think that's what leaders do. I do think that—I think that there is a difference of opinion here in Washington about tools necessary to protect the country—the terrorist surveillance program—or what did you call it, Hutcheson? Yes, the illegal eavesdropping program is what you wanted to call it—[]—IEP as opposed to TSP. [] There's just a difference of opinion about what we need to do to protect our country, Mark. I'm confident the leader, you know, meant nothing personal. I know that he shares my concern that we pass good legislation to get something done.Ken.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks**  
   - The interviewer wants a direct judgment: (a) does the speaker agree with the Republican leader’s claim that “Democrats are more interested in protecting terrorists than protecting the American people?” and (b) does the speaker think that claim is appropriate or warrants an apology?

2. **How the answer addresses it**  
   - The speaker begins with “I wouldn't have exactly put it that way,” which signals disagreement but does not state a clear “yes” or “no.”  
   - The response then shifts to a discussion of the PATRIOT Act, historical debates, and “differences of approach” without ever answering the specific allegation about protecting terrorists vs. protecting Americans.  
   - The speaker later says “I don’t question the patriotism of somebody who doesn’t agree with me,” which is a general statement about tone, but it still does not directly answer whether the Republican leader’s claim is accurate or whether an apology is owed.

3. **Information type**  
   - The answer is **partial and indirect**. It offers a vague, generalized stance (“I wouldn’t have exactly put it that way”) and then veers into unrelated policy discussion.  
   - It does not provide a clear, explicit answer to the two‑part question (agreement/disagreement and tone/apology).

4. **Evasion/deflection**  
   - The response deflects from the specific allegation, reframes the issue in terms of “differences of approach,” and avoids a straightforward yes/no or apology statement.  
   - This fits the definition of an **ambivalent** reply: the information is given but incompletely and implicitly, leaving the core question unanswered.

**Conclusion:** The interviewee’s response is incomplete, indirect, and does not explicitly answer the question, fitting the “Ambivalent” category.

120,Do you want Israel to win the war on terror rather than stopping it?,"Q. Mr. President, you spoke of having a plan to rebuild houses in Lebanon. Wouldn't the people of Lebanon rather know when you're going to tell the Israelis to stop destroying houses?And, Prime Minister, you've talked of having a plan today, but isn't the truth that you and the President believe that Israel is on the right side in the war on terror and you want them to win this war, not to stop it?","Look, we care deeply about the people whose lives have been affected in Lebanon, just like we care deeply about the people whose lives have been affected in Israel. There's over a million people in Israel that are threatened by this consistent rocket attack coming out of Lebanon. And, yes, we want to help people rebuild their lives, absolutely. But we also want to address the root causes of the problem, and the root cause of the problem is you've got Hizballah that is armed and willing to fire rockets into Israel—a Hizballah, by the way, that I firmly believe is backed by Iran and encouraged by Iran.And so for the sake of long-term stability, we've got to deal with this issue now. Listen, the temptation is to say, It's too tough. Let's just try to solve it quickly with something that won't last; let's just get it off the TV screens. But that won't solve the problem. And it's certainly not going to help the Lebanese citizens have a life that is normal and peaceful.What is necessary is to help the Siniora Government, and one way to help the Siniora Government is to make aid available to help rebuild the houses that were destroyed. Another way to help the Siniora Government is to implement 1559, which is the disarmament of armed militia inside his country.And I—look, we care deeply about the lives that have been affected on both sides of this issue, just like I care deeply about the innocent people who are being killed in Iraq and people being denied a state in the Palestinian Territory. But make no mistake about it, it is the goal and aims of the terrorist organizations to stop that type of advance. That's what they're trying to do. They're trying to evoke sympathy for themselves. They're not sympathetic people. They're violent, coldblooded killers who are trying to stop the advance of freedom.And this is the calling of the 21st century, it seems like to me, and now is the time to confront the problem. And of course, we're going to help the people in Lebanon rebuild their lives. But as Tony said, this conflict started, out of the blue, with two Israeli soldiers kidnaped and rockets being fired across the border.Now, we have urged restraint. We made it clear that we care about wanton destruction. On the other hand, in my judgment, it would be a big mistake not to solve the underlying problems. Otherwise, everything will seem fine, and then you'll be back at a press conference saying, How come you didn't solve the underlying problems? We feel deeply for people in Lebanon and people in Israel who are the innocent casualties of this conflict. Of course we do. And we want it to stop, and we want it to stop now. And what we're putting forward today is actually a practical plan that would lead to a U.N. resolution—could be early next week—that would allow it, put in place the conditions for it to stop.But what we've also got to do is to make sure that we recognize that this action wasn't simply aimed against Israel, and then Israel retaliated. It was also aimed against the proper Government of Lebanon being able to control its own country. And the very reason why, 2 years ago, the international community passed this resolution was because people could see that what was going to happen in southern Lebanon was that these Hizballah militias, that are armed and financed by Iran and by Syria, were going to move into the south of the country in order to be a focus of terrorism and discontent.Now, that is the fact. And of course, all of us are appalled at the destruction and loss of life; of course, we are. And that's why we've actually come together today with a viable plan—if people can agree it, as I believe they can—to get it stopped. But once you stop this violence happening now—which, of course, we should do—once you do, it doesn't alter the underlying reality unless we've got a framework that allows us to put the Government of Lebanon properly back in charge of its own country; unless we've got the commitment to take forward the Israel-Palestine two-state deal, which is there and which everyone wants to see; and then if we can—unless we mobilize the international community, to deal with the threat that Iran poses.And there's no other way out of this. We're not—we can, all of us, make whatever statements we want to do, use whatever words we want to do, but the brutal reality of the situation is that we're only going to get violence stopped and stability introduced on the basis of clear principles.Now, as I say, we've set out a way to do this. But it requires the long term, as well as the short term.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct judgment: *Does the interviewee want Israel to win the war on terror rather than stop it?* The expected answer would be a clear “yes,” “no,” or an explicit statement of the interviewee’s position on that specific point.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response talks about caring for people on both sides, about Israel being “on the right side,” about root‑cause solutions, and about helping Lebanon rebuild. It never states outright whether the interviewee *wants Israel to win* the war on terror *instead of* stopping it. The answer is indirect, offering context and justification rather than a straightforward affirmation or denial.

3. **Information type** – The answer is **partial and implicit**. It touches on the relevant theme (Israel’s stance, the war on terror, the need to address underlying problems) but does so in a vague, generalized way. It does not give the explicit answer the question demands.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker shifts the focus to broader policy goals (aid, disarmament, long‑term stability) and uses rhetorical framing (“we care deeply…”, “make no mistake…”) instead of answering the binary question directly. This is characteristic of a deflection rather than a full refusal to answer.

5. **Classification decision** – Because the response provides **some related information but in an incomplete, indirect, and non‑explicit manner**, it fits the definition of an **Ambivalent** reply: the requested information is given, but only partially and implicitly, leaving the core question unanswered in a clear way.

122,"Are you committed to building the 700 miles of fence, actual fencing?","Q. Thank you. On a different topic, you've said you will sign the border fence bill to build 700 miles of fence along the U.S. border, but DHS has said it prefers a virtual fence of sensors and cameras rather than an actual wall. Are you committed to building the 700 miles of fence, actual fencing?","Yes, we're going to do both, Joe. We're just going to make sure that we build it in a spot where it works. I don't—DHS said they want a virtual wall. I don't believe that's the only thing they've said. I think you might have truncated their statement, because we're actually building fence, and we're building double fence, in particular, in areas where there is a high vulnerability for people being able to sneak in.You can't fence the entire border, but what you can do is you can use a combination of fencing and technology to make it easier for the Border Patrol to enforce our border. I happen to believe, however, that in order to make sure the border is fully secure, we need a guest-worker program, so people aren't sneaking in in the first place.And so I look forward to not only implementing that which Congress has funded, in a way that says to folks, the American people, We'll enforce our border, but I'm going to continue to campaign and work for a comprehensive bill so that whatever we do in terms of equipment and manpower works better. If somebody is not trying to sneak in to work, in other words, coming through in a way where they're showing a temporary-worker pass, where they're not using to smuggle across, where they're not going through tunnels, it's going to make it much easier for us to do our job, Joe, and that's enforce the border.And so my judgment is, if the people want this country secure, we've got to do— have a smart border, which we're in the process of developing now. It's a combination of fencing and technologies—UAVs, sensors. I don't know if you've ever been down there, but it's a pretty vast part of country down there. It's hard to enforce that border. You've got some rugged country; you've got stretches of territory where you don't even know where the border is. You've got urban areas like El Paso or southern California where people have been able to sneak in by use of urban corridors. And so therefore, fencing makes sense there.I went down to Arizona, the Arizona sector, and saw a place where there's literally neighborhoods abutting the border, and people come—100 of them would rush across the border into a little subdivision, and the Border Patrol would catch 2 or 3, and 97 would get in. And they're asking, what are you going to provide to help us do our job? And in this case, those who are in charge of coming up with the proper strategy to enforce the border said, We need double fencing with space, so that the Border Patrol can use that fencing as leverage against people rushing into the country.And my only point to you is, is that the strategy to develop this border requires different assets based on the conditions— based upon what the terrain looks like. And that's what we're doing.But I repeat to you: When you've got a situation where people are sneaking in to do jobs Americans aren't doing, it's also going to keep a strain on the border. And so therefore, a temporary-worker plan, to me, makes sense, and it's a much more humane program—approach, by the way. It will certainly help stamp out all these illegal characters that are exploiting human beings. You know, these that stuff people in the back of 18-wheelers for money is just—that's not in character with how this Nation works. And I think we ought to—I think a good program that helps us enforce our border also will see to it that people are treated more humanely.Thank you for your interest.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a clear answer to whether the interviewee is *committed* to building the **actual 700‑mile fence** (i.e., physical fencing) as opposed to a “virtual” fence of sensors and cameras.

2. **How the answer addresses it** –  
   - The interviewee begins with “Yes, we’re going to do both, Joe,” which sounds like an affirmative, but immediately follows with qualifiers: “We’re just going to make sure that we build it in a spot where it works.”  
   - The response then shifts to a broader discussion of “a combination of fencing and technology,” “double fence,” and “virtual wall,” emphasizing that the approach depends on location and vulnerability.  
   - No explicit statement is made confirming that the full 700 miles of **physical** fence will be built, nor is there a definitive “I am committed to building the 700‑mile fence” declaration.  
   - The answer is largely a deflection that talks around the specifics, providing only general policy language rather than a direct, unambiguous commitment.

3. **Information type** – The response is **incomplete** and **implicit**. It offers some related ideas (fencing, technology, double fencing) but stops short of answering the precise question about commitment to the 700‑mile physical fence. The answer is therefore not a clear, explicit reply.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The interviewee avoids a straightforward yes/no answer, instead framing the issue in broader terms and emphasizing flexibility based on “where it works.” This constitutes a deflection rather than a direct answer.

123,Participants of the multinational force,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On the issue of the multinational force, what shape should it take; who should lead it; who should be part of it? And also, should Hizballah agreeing to it be a precondition for setting up the force?And, Mr. Prime Minister, you talked about a resolution leading to a cessation of hostilities, and I'm just wondering, should it include a call for an immediate cease-fire?","In terms of the troops, that's what the meeting Monday is going to be about. And this is one of these issues that requires international consensus. People will put forth ideas, and we'll participate, in terms of trying to help develop a consensus about what the force ought to look like.In a general sense, though, the force needs to serve as a complement to a Lebanese force. See, that's the whole purpose of the force, is to strengthen the Lebanese Government by helping the Lebanese force move into the area. The whole cornerstone of the policy for Lebanon is for Lebanon to be free and able to govern herself and defend herself with a viable force.And so one of the things you'll see in discussions there is, how do we help the Lebanese Army succeed? What does it— what's required? What's the manpower need to be in order to help this force move into the south so the government can take control of the country. What it looks like— if I hold a press conference on Tuesday, I'll be able to answer that better. But since I probably won't be, read your newspaper.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a concrete answer about *who* will be part of the multinational force, *what* its composition will be, and related details (shape, leadership, etc.).

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee talks in general terms about “the troops,” “international consensus,” and “a complement to a Lebanese force,” but never lists specific participants, leadership structures, or concrete composition details. The response is vague, indirect, and ends with a deflection (“read your newspaper”).

3. **Information type** – The answer provides only partial, implicit information about the force’s purpose and the need for consensus. It does not directly answer the requested specifics about participants.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker shifts to a future press conference and suggests the audience look to newspapers, rather than giving a clear answer now.

**Conclusion** – The response is incomplete and only partially addresses the question, offering general themes without the explicit details requested. This fits the definition of an *Ambivalent* response.

124,Did you cross the t's and dot the i's in your discussion with President Bush regarding the security needs?,"Q. I have two questions—one, President Bush. The first one: Is there an obvious change that could be made to the security status, you politically—particularly in Baghdad right now?And the second question for you, Mr. Prime Minister. You said in a press conference in Baghdad that your visit to Washington, you will put—you will cross the t's and dot the i's, especially regarding the security needs. Did you cross the t's and dot the i's in your discussion with President Bush?","——a lot of time talking about security, and I can understand why. Because there's—there are people who are willing to destroy innocent life to achieve a political objective. And the Prime Minister is deeply concerned about the lives of his fellow citizens. And I appreciate that concern. I would be very worried if a Prime Minister came to talk about his country and did not mention, first and foremost, protecting people's lives. That's, after all, the most important responsibility of government.And he believes, and I believe, that the—there needs to be more forces inside Baghdad who are willing to hold people to account. In other words, if you find somebody who's kidnaping and murdering, the murderer ought to be held to account. It ought to be clear in society that that kind of behavior is not tolerated.And that's the attitude of the Prime Minister. My attitude is, we shouldn't try to gauge whether or not someone is justified or not; we ought to be saying that if you murder, you're responsible for your actions. And I think the Iraqi people appreciate that type of attitude.And so we—so we're not only talking about adjusting a Baghdad plan at the Prime Minister's request to make it more effective—we're also talking about how to make the Iraqi Army more effective. But the truth of the matter is, the Iraqi Army is becoming a highly professional force that will help bring confidence to the people inside Iraq that the Government has got the capacity to protect them. Thank you, Mr. President. Actually, successful acts and large issues has to be based on a clear vision. And through the serious discussion and the clear and the frank conversation that I had with President George Bush, that we are truly crossing the t's and dotting the i's in terms of enhancing the security and supporting the reconstruction. Through the discussion, we were able to go through the details of the vision that will cover the future, because we are not talking here about a specific phase of the reconstruction, but we are facing the necessity of continuous work in order to make sure that the entire political experiment will succeed.I believe with a great deal of confidence that I have reaffirmed through this, and I became convinced that—I have full confidence of victory, and we will be highly capable of defeating terrorism in Iraq.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct answer to whether the interviewee *crossed the t’s and dotted the i’s* (i.e., completed the promised details) in the discussion with President Bush about security needs. The expected response would be a clear “yes,” “no,” or a brief statement confirming or denying that the procedural details were fully addressed.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does mention “crossing the t’s and dotting the i’s” in the context of the conversation, but the statement is embedded in a long, indirect discourse about security, the Iraqi Army, and “a clear vision.” The response never explicitly says *yes* or *no*; instead it uses the phrase as part of a broader, vague description of the discussion.

3. **Information type** – The answer provides only an implicit reference to the procedural phrase and does not give a concrete, explicit confirmation or denial about whether the “t’s and i’s” were actually crossed. It is therefore incomplete and indirect.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The response deflects from the specific yes/no query by expanding into a general narrative about security, reconstruction, and confidence‑building. It avoids a straightforward answer to the question asked.

5. **Classification decision** – Because the response touches on the requested phrase but does so in an incomplete, implicit, and non‑committal manner, it fits the definition of an **Ambivalent** reply: the information is given but in a partial, vague, and deflecting way rather than being explicitly stated.

Mr. President, in the last couple of weeks, every time the question was asked, why not get an immediate cessation and then build a sustainable—terms for a sustainable cease-fire after you get the hostilities stopped, it was categorically rejected. Yet a few weeks later, here we are. Can you explain why this wasn't done a couple weeks ago?","Sure. Because, first of all, the international community hadn't come together on a concept of how to address the root cause of the problem, Jim.Part of the problem in the past in the Middle East is people would paper over the root cause of the problem, and therefore, the situation would seemingly be quiet, and then lo and behold, there'd be another crisis. And innocent people would suffer. And so our strategy all along has been, of course we want to have a cessation of hostilities, but what we want to do in the same time is to make sure that there is a way forward for the Lebanese Government to secure its own country so that there's peace in the region.And that deals with an international peacekeeping force to complement a Lebanese army moving into the south to make sure that Resolution 1559, passed 2 years ago by the U.N., was fully upheld. Had the parties involved fully implemented 1559, which called for the disarmament of Hizballah, we would not be in the situation we're in today.Let's see here. Yes, Richard [Richard Benedetto, USA Today].",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a clear explanation of *why* the approach (an immediate cessation of hostilities followed by a sustainable cease‑fire) was rejected a couple of weeks ago but is now being considered.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not directly answer “why it wasn’t done earlier.”  
   - Instead, they speak about the need for the international community to agree on a concept, reference past Middle‑East patterns, and outline a broader strategy involving Lebanese sovereignty, UN Resolution 1559, and an international peacekeeping force.  
   - These points provide background context but do not explicitly state the reason the approach was rejected at that earlier time.

3. **Information type** – The response is **partial and implicit**. It offers related background information but stops short of giving the specific, direct explanation the question demands. It is neither a full denial nor a complete non‑reply; rather, it deflects and leaves the core “why not earlier?” question unanswered.

4. **Evasion check** – The answer sidesteps the precise temporal rationale and instead discusses general policy considerations. This fits the pattern of a **dodging/deflection** response.

127,"Mr. President, are you disappointed that the Israelis and the Palestinians haven't made more specific progress since Annapolis?","Q. Mr. President, are you disappointed that the Israelis and the Palestinians haven't made more specific progress since Annapolis? And is it maybe time for you to apply some of that direct pressure you referred to earlier?And for the Prime Minister, did you offer any new assurances to the President—or do you plan to—that Israel will stop disputed settlement and construction activity?","Step one of any complicated process that is going to require a lot of hard work and serious dialogue is whether the mindset is right. It's one thing for somebody to say to the President, sure, we're for a two state, just to make the President feel okay. That's not the case here. The fundamental questions that I was seeking at Annapolis and on my return trip is the understanding about the power of what a vision will do for peace.You know, one of the concerns I had was that, whether it be the unprovoked rocket attacks or the issues of settlement, that the leaders would be so bogged down in the moment that they would lose sight of the potential for a historic agreement. And I've come away with the belief that while those issues are important and certainly create consternation amongst the respective constituencies, that both leaders are determined to make the hard choices necessary.Now, implicit in your question is whether or not the President should butt in and actually dictate the end result of the agreement. In my judgment, that would cause there to be a nonlasting agreement. In my judgment, the only way for there to be a vision that means something is for the parties to seriously negotiate that vision. If you're asking me, am I nudging them forward, well, my trip was a pretty significant nudge, because yesterday they had a meeting.And by the way, the atmosphere in America was, nothing is going to happen, see; that these issues are too big on the ground. Therefore, you two can't get together and come up with any agreements. You just heard the man talk about their desire to deal with core issues, which, I guess for the uneducated on the issue, that means dealing with the issues like territory and right of return and Jerusalem. Those are tough issues—the issue of Israeli security. And they're going to sit down at the table and discuss those issues in seriousness.And I've been briefed today from the Israeli perspective of those discussions. Tomorrow I'll be briefed by the Palestinians about their interpretation.Now, there's three tracks going on, by the way, during this process. One is the vision track. Let me just make sure everybody understands—in our delegation—the goal. The goal is for there to be a clear vision of what a state would look like so that, for example, reasonable Palestinian leadership can say, here's your choice: You can have the vision of Hamas, which is dangerous and will lead to war and violence, or you can have the vision of a state, which should be hopeful.The second track is to help both parties deal with roadmap issues. Settlements is a roadmap issue; security is a roadmap issue, in a certain limited sense. Third issue is to help the Palestinians, one, organize their security forces so that they can better assure their own people and, equally importantly, better assure Israel that they can deal with the extremists in their midst. That's what General Dayton is doing here, for example. Or an economic track—listen, the best way to make sure that the Palestinians realize there's a hopeful future in which it's in their interests to live at peace with Israel is for them to realize that they've got an economy in which they can make a living. And Tony Blair is helpful on that, and so is America.And so you're watching three tracks parallel each other. And the one, of course, you're asking about is whether or not the leadership has got the willingness and the desire and the drive to design a state, compatible to both sides. And my answer is, yes, I think they will. I hope that I don't disappoint anyone—certainly not the President, because we talked at length— if I will say that the President didn't ask for me to make any commitments other than the ones that Israel made already with regard to the peace process and as I have spelled it out on many different occasions, including in Annapolis, which was a very, as I said, a very important event. The commitment of Israel is absolutely to carry on in this process in order to realize the vision of two states living side by side, as I said before.Now, there are many issues. Settlement is one of the issues. We made clear our position. And I know that sometimes not everyone is happy with this position, but we are very sincere. And we were never trying to conceal any of these facts from anyone, starting with President Bush and Secretary Rice and, of course, our Palestinian partners.They know that there is a moratorium on new settlements and the new expropriation of land in the Territories. But they also know, and we have made it clear, that Jerusalem, as far as we are concerned, is not in the same status. And they know that the population centers are not in the same status. And there might be things that will happen in the population centers or in Jerusalem which they may not be in love with, but we will discuss them, and we will not hide them. We are not going to build any new settlements or expropriate land in the Territories. We made it clear, and we will stand by our commitments. And we will fulfill all our commitments as part of the roadmap because this is an essential part for any progress that will have to take place in the future.But there are some aspects only just realized which one can't ignore, and everyone knows that certain things in Jerusalem are not in the same tactical level as they are in other parts of the Territories which are outside the city of Jerusalem. And so it's true about some population centers. So there was nothing that happened that was not known in advance to all our partners in this process. We made clear our positions. We made clear exactly what we can do, what we can't do, what we want to do, and what we will not be able to do. And I think that they all know it, and they—at least even when sometimes they disagree with us, they at least respect our sincerity and openness about these issues.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking the President a direct, binary‑style question: *“Are you disappointed that the Israelis and the Palestinians haven’t made more specific progress since Annapolis?”*  
   The expected answer would be a clear statement of the President’s emotional or political stance (e.g., “Yes, I am disappointed,” or “No, I am not disappointed”).

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response does not contain a straightforward “yes” or “no” about disappointment. Instead it:
   - Shifts to a broader discussion of “mindset,” “vision,” and “the power of a vision for peace.”
   - Talks about the need for leaders not to be “bogged down in the moment.”
   - Mentions that the President “nudged” the parties forward, but never states whether the President is *disappointed*.
   - Provides general commentary about negotiations, settlements, and visions, but never directly answers the specific query about disappointment.

3. **Information type** – The answer is **partial and indirect**. It touches on related themes (progress, vision, nudging) but leaves the core question unanswered. It is neither a full refusal to answer nor a complete non‑reply; rather, it offers a vague, generalized response that sidesteps the explicit request.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker deflects the question by moving to a higher‑level discussion of process and vision rather than addressing the emotional reaction (“disappointed”) that the interviewer seeks.

**Conclusion:** The response provides the requested information only in an incomplete, indirect, and somewhat evasive manner. It does not give a clear, explicit answer to the question.

Are you prepared to pass on the fate of the war to the next President?And, Mr. Prime Minister, if I may, what do you see as the biggest mistakes in the management of the war, and what do you propose to do to correct them?","David Petraeus, the general on the ground, will be bringing his recommendations back to the Congress on or about September the 15th. And I think it's going to be very important for all of us to wait for him to report. And the reason it's important is, is that I believe that the decisions on the way forward in Iraq must be made with a military recommendation as an integral part of it. And therefore, I don't want to prejudge what David is going to say.I have said this is going to take a long time, just like this ideological—in Iraq, just like the ideological struggle is going to take a long time. And so I look forward to David's report, and then we'll respond accordingly. There has been some notable progress, Anbar Province being such a place where there's bottom-up reconciliation, where people are rejecting this Al Qaida vision of the world and saying, there's a better way forward.There's still setbacks, obviously. We've got these suiciders that are trying to foment sectarian violence. But, Ben, I would ask you and the Congress to wait, to do what I'm doing, which is wait until David to come back and make his report. And I think you'll find it will be considered and based upon the evidence there on the ground. You asked about the difficulties we've faced, and a lot has happened over the last period of time. I think the difficulties include the—getting political reconciliation within Iraq itself, moving forward the reconstruction and the time it has taken to do so.But I think the one thing that I'm pleased about is that Iraq is now building up its own security forces, it's now building up its own military, and it's now building up its own police. So we've got to a situation where there are perhaps 300,000 people who are in the Iraqi security and policing forces.In Basra and in the four Provinces that we're dealing with, security forces have built up over the last few years now to around 30,000 people. It's in that context where we can then achieve what we want to do, which is to pass security over to the Iraqi people themselves, to pass it over to the elected Iraqi Government, and of course, to local Provincial control.And one of the encouraging things that's happened over the last few months, indeed the last year and more, is that we've been able to pass the control of the three of the four Provinces for which we've got responsibility back to Iraqi hands. And of course, the issue in Basra, which is the largest Province, is the point at which we can do what we want to do, which is to have local people and local army and local police in charge of the security there.So that is the challenge that we face over this next period of time: that Iraq itself becomes more responsible for its own security; that we are able to pass control of the Province both to elected politicians and to the security services; and we're able to combine that with the people of Iraq themselves having a stake in the future.So yes, there have been problems, but, yes, also, when you look at the four Provinces for which we've got responsibility, we can see that we're able to move control back to the Iraqi people in three. And there's a chance of being able to do that in the fourth as a result of the buildup of the security forces.Nick [Nick Robinson, BBC News]. Gosh, still hanging around.

130,Do you think the decision by your G-20 counterparts here to endorse stiff deficit reduction goals is a repudiation of your view that cutting deficits too quickly and too fast would hinder the global economic recovery?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Do you think the decision by your G-20 counterparts here to endorse stiff deficit reduction goals is a repudiation of your view that cutting deficits too quickly and too fast would hinder the global economic recovery?And then if I could ask you just quickly on North Korea, you said yesterday that North Korea must be held to account for the sinking of the South Korean warship and that there must be consequences for such irresponsible behavior. What, specifically--what kind of punishment would you like to see imposed on North Korea, short of some sort of condemnation from the U.N. Security Council?",Okay.,Clear Non-Reply,"**Step‑by‑step reasoning**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is seeking a direct judgment: whether the G‑20’s endorsement of “stiff deficit‑reduction goals” constitutes a repudiation of the speaker’s own view that rapid deficit cuts would hurt global recovery.

2. **What the answer provides** – The interviewee replies with a single word, “Okay.”  
   - This does **not** address the substance of the question.  
   - It offers no affirmation, denial, explanation, or any indication of the speaker’s stance on the issue.  
   - It is not an expression of ignorance or a request for clarification; it is simply a non‑answer.

3. **Matching to the classification categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – Requires the requested information to be explicitly stated. The answer does not state any position, so it fails this criterion.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – Applies when the information requested is *not given at all* because the respondent declines to answer, is ignorant, or otherwise does not provide the answer. The single “Okay.” is precisely such a non‑answer; it conveys no substantive response to the question.  
   - **Ambivalent** – Would apply if the answer were partially informative, vague, or deflecting. Here the answer is not even a vague statement; it is a non‑statement.

4. **Conclusion** – The response provides **no** information about whether the G‑20 decision is a repudiation of the speaker’s view. It is a clear instance of refusing or failing to answer.

**Classification:** **Clear Non‑Reply**  

**LABEL:** Clear Non-Reply","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to the specific question: ""Do you think the decision by your G-20 counterparts here to endorse stiff deficit reduction goals is a repudiation of your view that cutting deficits too quickly and too fast would hinder the global economic recovery?""

131,How do you respond to his charges?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Former President Clinton says that your administration had no meetings on bin Laden for 9 months after he left office. Is that factually accurate, and how do you respond to his charges?","You know, look, Caren, I've watched all this finger-pointing and naming of names and all that stuff. Our objective is to secure the country. And we've had investigations; we had the 9/11 Commission; we had the look back this; we've had the look back that. The American people need to know that we spend all our time doing everything that we can to protect them. So I'm not going to comment on other comments.But I will comment on this—that we're on the offense against an enemy who wants to do us harm. And we must have the tools necessary to protect our country. On the one hand, if Al Qaida or Al Qaida affiliates are calling somebody in the country, we need to know why. And so Congress needs to pass that piece of legislation. If somebody has got information about a potential attack, we need to be able to ask that person some questions. And so Congress has got to pass that piece of legislation.You can't protect America unless we give those people on the frontlines of protecting this country the tools necessary to do so within the Constitution. And that's where the debate is here in the United States. There are some decent people who don't believe—evidently don't believe we're at war and therefore shouldn't give the administration what is necessary to protect us.And that goes back to Jennifer's question, you know. Does being on the offense mean we create terrorists? My judgment is, the only way to defend the country is to stay on the offense. It is preposterous to think if we were to withdraw and hope for the best, things would turn out fine against this enemy. That was my point about, before we were in Iraq, there were thousands being trained in Afghanistan to strike America and other places. The only way to protect this country is to stay on the offense, is to deal with threats before they fully materialize and, in the long term, help democracy succeed, like Afghanistan and Iraq and Lebanon and a Palestinian state.But there's a difference of opinion. It will come clear during this campaign, where people will say, Get out, leave before the job is done. And those are good, decent, patriotic people who believe that way; I just happen to believe they're absolutely wrong. So I'm going to continue to work to protect this country. And we'll let history judge—all the different finger-pointing and all that business. I don't have enough time to finger-point. I've got to stay—I've got to do my job, which comes home every day in the Oval Office, and that is to protect the American people from further attack.Now, there are some who say, Well, maybe it's not going to happen. Well, they don't see what I see. All I ask is that they look at that terror plot that, along with the Brits, we helped stop—people who were going to get on an airplane and blow up innocent lives in order to achieve political objectives. They're out there; they're mean; and they need to be brought to justice.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct response to the allegation that “your administration had no meetings on bin Laden for 9 months after he left office.” The expected answer would address whether that claim is true and explain the speaker’s position on it.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not mention the specific allegation, the 9‑month period, or the factual accuracy of the claim. Instead, the response:
   - Shifts to a broad defense of the administration’s overall security posture.
   - Talks generally about investigations, the 9/11 Commission, and the need for legislative tools.
   - Uses vague, defensive language (“look, Caren…”) and deflects to a larger political narrative.
   - Ends with a sweeping statement about staying on the offense and letting history judge.

3. **Nature of the information provided** – The answer is **partial and indirect**. It offers a general defensive stance but never explicitly states whether the accusation is accurate, nor does it explain the administration’s specific response to that particular charge. The response is therefore **incomplete, implicit, and evasive**.

4. **Classification decision** – Because the response provides some related commentary but fails to give a clear, direct answer to the specific charge, it fits the definition of an **Ambivalent** reply: the information is given in an incomplete, indirect, and somewhat deflecting manner.

**LABEL: Ambivalent**","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to ""How do you respond to his charges?""

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a concrete statement about the speaker’s view on *military options* that might be considered *after* diplomacy has been exhausted and a timetable run out.

2. **How the answer addresses it** –  
   - The speaker says “diplomacy hasn’t run its course” and that they will “continue working to give diplomacy a full opportunity to succeed.”  
   - No mention is made of *military options*, *contingency plans*, or any assessment of what would happen once diplomacy ends.  
   - The response ends with a name‑call (“Yes, David…”) and does not elaborate.

3. **Information provided** – The answer is vague, circular, and avoids the substantive content of the question. It only restates a position about diplomacy without addressing the specific query about military options.

4. **Classification decision** – Because the response does not give a clear, explicit answer but instead deflects and leaves the question unanswered, it fits the **Ambivalent** category: the information is incomplete, partial, and effectively a deflection rather than a direct reply.

133,expectations for the families of the Illinois National Guardsmen who have left for Iraq,"Q. Yes, sir. Thank you. Mr. President, three Illinois National Guard units left this week for Iraq. At a time when there's discussion about withdraw or drawdown of troops, what are the families of these Illinois National Guardsmen to expect?","They expect that their loved one will be participating in a noble and important cause. If I didn't think it was important, I wouldn't have put out the orders to have people go there. And if I didn't think we could win, I wouldn't be there. That's what they can expect. They can expect tough work, tough sledding, and they can expect a grateful Commander in Chief and a grateful nation for their sacrifices.In terms of troop levels, those decisions will be made by General Casey. There's a debate in Washington as to whether or not we set an artificial timetable for withdrawal. That's what it's about in Washington, DC. And the answer is, absolutely not. You can't win a war if you have an artificial timetable for withdrawal. You can't have people making troop decisions based upon political considerations. It just won't work. It's unfair to those families that we're sending—of the kids we're sending over, and it's unfair to the troops.Artificial timetable for withdrawal sends the wrong message to the Iraqis; they're seeing it's not worth it. There's a lot of Iraqis over there determined—trying to make up their mind whether they want to be a part of democracy or whether or not they're going to take to the hills and see what happens. Artificial timetable for withdrawal, kind of early withdrawal before this finishes, sends the message to the enemy, we were right about America. That's what they say. Al Qaida has said it's just a matter of time before America withdraws. They're weak; they're corrupt; they can't stand it; and they'll withdraw. And all that would do is confirm what the enemy thinks.And getting out before we finish the job would send a terrible message to the troops who've sacrificed. We'll win. We'll achieve our objective, which is a free country that can govern itself, defend itself, and sustain itself and will be an ally in the war on terror. And we're making progress toward that goal.The problem is that the enemy gets to define success better than we do. See, they'll kill innocent people like that; they don't care. Life is not precious to them. And they're willing to kill women and children in order to achieve a tactical objective. And it gets on our TV screens. And people mourn the loss of life. This is a compassionate nation that cares about people, and when they see people die on their TV screens, it sends a signal: Well, maybe we're not winning.We occasionally are able to pop in with great success, like Zarqawi or 12 million people voting. But increasing electricity in Baghdad is not the kind of thing that tends to get on the news, or small-business formation is not the kind of thing to get— or new schools or new hospitals, the infrastructure being rebuilt that had been torn apart. And I'm not being critical. I'm just giving you a fact of something I have to deal with in order to make it clear to the American people that the sacrifice of those families is worth it. We are winning. And a free Iraq is an essential part of changing the conditions which causes the terrorists to be able to recruit killers in the first place.For a long period of time, our foreign policy was just, kind of, excuse tyranny and hope for the best. It didn't work. The world may have seemed placid, it may have seemed calm, but beneath the surface was resentment and hatred, out of which came an attack that killed 3,000 of our citizens.And so I am committed to the spread of liberty. It's, after all, how we were founded. And there's a debate here in the United States that says, well, maybe it's too much for the United States to insist others live in a free world. Maybe that's just too unilateral. I view that as cultural elitism for people who say that. It's like saying, we're okay to be free, but you're not.I believe freedom is universal, and I believe etched in the soul of every person on the face of the Earth is the desire to be free. And I know that freedom has got the capacity to change regions of the world for the better.Our press corps is bored with this story, but I'm going to tell it anyway—the Koizumi story. [] That's what you get when you get familiar with people; they can anticipate your remarks.I hope you thought it was interesting that Prime Minister Koizumi and I went to Graceland. It was really a lot of fun, wasn't it? It's an interesting part of the development of our relationship, from one in which Japan was the enemy of the United States and today, the son of a person who fought the Japanese and the son of a person who resented the United States are close friends. We talk about keeping the peace. We talk about working together to change the world for the better: What do we do? How do we feed people who are hungry? How do we build roads in Afghanistan? What do we do?And so what happened? What happened was, is that Japan adopted a Japanese-style democracy after World War II, and the conditions of our relationship, the condition of the country changed; the attitude changed, and our relationship changed.The Far East was a pretty difficult place. I know we spend a lot of time talking about the Far East today because of , but if you really look at the development in the Far East, it's pretty remarkable, isn't it? South Korea has emerged into a vibrant capitalist society. Japan has still got a little hangover from their previous activities in the region but, nevertheless, is a thriving partner in peace. Taiwan is making progress. China has got opening markets. Their economy is growing. Their entrepreneurial class is strong. They need to—the political system needs to evolve. But nevertheless, the region is relatively peaceful except for one outpost, one system that's not open and transparent, one system that doesn't respond to the will of the people, one system that's dark, and that's .It took a while for that peaceful evolution to occur. And that's what's going to happen in the Middle East. It is. And it's hard work. And I want those parents to know that. These are historic times. We will lose if we leave too early. The stakes of success are vital, but a free Iraq is going to help inspire others to demand what I believe is a universal right of men and women.General Casey will make the decisions as to how many troops we have there. And that's important for the families to know. It's really important. General Casey is a wise and smart man who has spent a lot of time in Baghdad recently, obviously. And it's his judgment that I rely upon. He'll decide how best to achieve victory and the troop levels necessary to do so.I spent a lot of time talking to him about troop levels, and I told him this, I said, you decide, General. I want your judgment, your advice. I don't want these decisions being made by the political noise, by the political moment. It's just unfair to our troops, and it's unfair to their families. It's the reasoned judgment of our military commanders that the President must count on in order to achieve a victory that is necessary to help make this country more secure. And that's exactly how I'm going to make my decision.So if the people are listening, they need to know I'm proud of their families. The cause is noble and necessary. And the size of the troops that will be there will depend upon the sound judgment of our military commanders.Thank you for this press conference. I've enjoyed it. Appreciate it.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a clear statement of what families of the departing Illinois National Guard members can expect (e.g., what they should anticipate regarding their loved ones’ service, the mission, and any support).

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee directly answers by saying:
   - Families can expect that their loved one will be “participating in a noble and important cause.”
   - They can expect “tough work, tough sledding,” and a “grateful Commander in Chief and a grateful nation for their sacrifices.”
   - The answer also links these expectations to the broader mission and to the importance of not imposing an artificial withdrawal timetable.

3. **Is the information explicit?** – Yes. The response spells out, in plain language, the expectations for those families. The key expectations are stated outright, not merely implied or left vague.

4. **Is there evasion or incompleteness?** – No. While the answer expands into related topics (troop‑level decisions, political debates, etc.), it does not dodge the core question. The expectations for the families are clearly articulated.

5. **Classification decision** – Because the requested information is given explicitly and directly, the appropriate label is **Clear Reply**.

134,"Do you demand that the peacekeeping force, if and when it gets up and running, disarm Hizballah?","Q. Mr. President, as you have reminded us a number of times, it was Hizballah that started the confrontation between Israel and Lebanon. But you were supportive of the holding off of any kind of cease-fire until Israel had a chance to clear out the Hizballah weapons. By all accounts, they did not exactly succeed in doing that. And by all accounts, the Lebanese Army, as it moved into southern Lebanon, had a-wink-and-a-nod arrangement with Hizballah not to disturb anything, to just leave things as they are, a situation not unknown in the Middle East. Do you demand that the peacekeeping force, if and when it gets up and running, disarm Hizballah?","The truth of the matter is, if 1559, that's the United Nations Security Council resolution number, had been fully implemented, we wouldn't be in the situation we were in to begin with. There is—there will be another resolution coming out of the United Nations giving further instructions to the international force. First things first—is to get the rules of engagement clear so that the force will be robust, to help the Lebanese.One thing is for certain—is that when this force goes in to help Lebanon, Hizballah won't have that safe haven or that kind of freedom to run on the—in Lebanon's southern border. In other words, there's an opportunity to create a cushion, a security cushion. Hopefully, over time, Hizballah will disarm. You can't have a democracy with a armed political party willing to bomb its neighbor without the consent of its Government, or just deciding, well, Let's just create enough chaos and discord by lobbing rockets.And so the reality is, in order for Lebanon to succeed—and we want Lebanon's democracy to succeed—the process is going to—the Lebanese Government is eventually going to have to deal with Hizballah.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct answer to a yes/no‑type query: *Does the speaker demand that any future peacekeeping force disarm Hizballah?*

2. **How the answer responds** – The speaker does not give a plain “yes” or “no.”  
   - He talks about UN Resolution 1559, upcoming UN resolutions, rules of engagement, and the need for a “robust” force.  
   - He says Hizballah “won’t have that safe haven” and that “over time, Hizballah will disarm,” but he never explicitly states whether he *demands* disarmament.  
   - The response is therefore indirect, conditional, and leaves the core demand unspecified.

3. **Information provided** – Some related content is offered (the goal of eventually disarming Hizballah, the intention to deny Hizballah a safe haven), but the answer remains **partial and implicit**. It does not clearly state the demanded policy.

4. **Evasion or deflection?** – The reply steers around the precise question (“Do you **demand**…?”) and instead discusses broader strategic objectives and procedural steps. This fits the pattern of a **dodging/deflection** answer.

135,What is the President's level of concern about protectionism in general?,"Q. Mr. President, there's a deal taking shape this morning where the Government of Dubai would buy a share of—a stake in the NASDAQ stock market. And there is some concern being expressed on Capitol Hill about this. It's another deal involving, you know, people overseas that we might not trust. What's your reaction to it? And also, what's your level of concern about protectionism in general?","My reaction is, is that we have a reform process in place that will be able to deal with this issue. In other words, we're going to take a good look at it as to whether or not it has any national security implications involved in the transaction. And I'm comfortable that the process will go forward.John, I'm also—I am concerned about protectionism. I'm concerned about it because if the United States loses its confidence when it comes to trading, it will make it less likely our economy would grow. And I just told you, one of the underpinnings of our support is the fact that exports—for economic vitality—is the fact that exports are up, and workers benefit when we're selling products overseas. And I believe these free trade agreements will be an interesting test of protectionism, whether protectionism is real.We've got four trade agreements that we've negotiated that we want to get passed, and there's going to be some crucial votes coming up here pretty soon in the Congress. And we'll work hard to get all four trade agreements through. And if they don't get through, it is a sign that the protectionists are beginning to be on the ascendancy here in Washington, DC, and that would be a mistake. And for people who are deeply concerned about poverty around the world like I am, the best way to help lift people out of poverty is through free trade agreements. And that's why we're dedicated to the Doha round that is—that Secretary Schwab is so actively engaged in—not Secretary Schwab, trade negotiator Schwab. And we're committed to reach an accord with these nations so that—because trade helps poor people realize a better life. And it's a proven fact.I'm also worried about isolationism. Isolationism tends to run hand in hand with protectionism. You'll find isolationists are those who say it's not our business what happens overseas, it doesn't matter if there's a free society in the heart of the Middle East, as far as our long-term security and peace. I just strongly reject that. I think it does matter a lot that the United States is working with other nations to promote liberty and freedom because I believe liberty is a change agent. Liberty can help hostile parts of the world become peaceful parts of the world.You know, our strategy in dealing with these extremists who still want to attack us is on the one hand, chase them and find them and bring them to justice, and on the other hand, help change the conditions that caused 19 kids to get on airplanes and come and kill nearly 3,000 citizens on our soil. The best way to do that is to be active with foreign policy. It's not to lose faith in values, but to actively promote universal values. And isolationists would say, it's not worth it, doesn't matter to the United States of America.

   - “one way to make sure we’re able to achieve our objective is to have other people join us…”
   - “we’ll give diplomacy a chance to work”
   - “It is very important for us to solve these problems diplomatically”
   - “when I call them on the phone, we’re strategizing… How can we continue to work together to solve this problem?”

   These sentences directly address the requested content: a message to both the American people and the international community about North Korea’s actions.

3. **Is the information explicit?** – Yes. The speaker spells out the content of the message (maintaining the prior stance, seeking multilateral support, pursuing diplomatic solutions). The answer does not hedge with “I’m not sure” or refuse to answer; it provides a clear, albeit somewhat general, statement.

4. **Is there evasion or incompleteness?** – The response is not a non‑reply; it does not refuse or deflect. It is not merely vague or partial in a way that leaves the core question unanswered. While the language is broader than a concise sound bite, it still supplies the substantive answer the question demands.

**Conclusion:** The interviewee supplies an explicit answer to the question, even though the phrasing is broader than a succinct sound bite. This fits the definition of a **Clear Reply**.

137,"On the NATO allies, do you believe that they're avoiding the fight, or at least some of them are?","Q. One more, I'm sorry. On the NATO allies, do you believe that they're avoiding the fight, or at least some of them are?","Well, I would like to praise the Brits, the Canadians, the Dutch, the Danes, and other countries for their contribution—the Aussies—for their contribution of shooters, fighters, people that are willing to be on the frontline of this battle. These are brave souls. They're working side by side with the Afghan forces and forces to deal the Taliban a blow. And I've only got praise for them.I understand that some countries are in a position where they can't commit combat troops. And so the question is, are we able to leverage their position in Iraq in such a way that enables us to stay on the offense against the Taliban, help the Afghans to do so?And my biggest concern is that people say, Well, we're kind of tired of Afghanistan; therefore, we think we're going to leave. That would be my biggest concern. And so our objective is to help people meet a mission that they're comfortable with achieving, and convince them that this is going to take a while. It's going to take time for this democratic experiment there in Afghanistan to work. And I believe it will.As you all know, I've said this many times from the podium: I do believe in the universality of freedom. I believe if people are given a chance to be free, they will do so. Now, I understand some don't believe that. It's kind of like we're the only ones that can be free. It's kind of the ultimate isolationism, isn't it? And the question then is, is it in our Nation's interest to help others realize the blessings of liberty? And I—clearly, the Bush foreign policy says it is, because I believe it's going to yield peace, and particularly important given the fact that we're in an ideological struggle against people who use murder to achieve political objectives.And we've faced these kind of people before in our past. And the question is, does it make sense to confront them? And if we forget the lessons of September the 11th as a nation, we will be naive or blind to the realities of the world. And the best way to confront these folks in the long term is to defeat their ideology with one based upon hope, and that's one based upon liberty. And that's what you're watching unfold. It's necessary work, and it's hard work, and it requires determination and effort and commitment. And so part of our efforts is to convince others, one, the nature of the world in which we live; two, that we're in an ideological struggle; and three, we will prevail because we've got the ultimate weapon against those who can't see anything but terror and murder as a way forward. And that is freedom.Yes, Holly [Holly Rosenkrantz, Bloomberg News].",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct assessment of whether NATO allies are “avoiding the fight,” i.e., a clear judgment on the allies’ willingness to engage in combat.

2. **How the answer addresses it** –  
   - The speaker does mention that some countries “can’t commit combat troops,” which touches on the issue.  
   - However, the response quickly shifts to praising certain allies, discussing broader strategic goals, and moving into a general discourse about Afghanistan, ideology, and liberty.  
   - No explicit statement is made about whether allies *are* or *are not* avoiding the fight; the answer remains vague and does not give a definitive answer.

3. **Information type** – The response provides only partial, indirect information. It acknowledges a nuance (some nations cannot commit troops) but does not answer the specific query about avoidance of the fight. The answer is therefore incomplete and deflects from the core question.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker moves away from the NATO‑allies question toward broader themes, which constitutes a deflection rather than a straightforward reply.

**Conclusion:** The answer does not give a clear, explicit judgment on whether NATO allies are avoiding the fight; it offers only a partial, indirect, and somewhat evasive response.

**Classification:** **Ambivalent**

138,Has the scandal damaged Hastert's credibility and effectiveness in maintaining party control in the midterm elections?,"Q. Mr. President, with growing numbers of House Members and staffers saying that they knew of and told others about a problem with Mark Foley some years ago, has House Speaker Hastert lost touch within his own ranks, and has the scandal damaged Hastert's credibility and effectiveness in maintaining party control in the midterm elections?","No, I think the Speaker's strong statements have made it clear to not only the party members but to the country that he wants to find out the facts. All of us want to find out the facts. I mean, this is disgusting behavior when a Member of Congress betrays the trust of the Congress and a family that sent a young page up to serve in the Congress. And I appreciated Speaker Hastert's strong declaration of his desire to get to the bottom of it. And we want to make sure we understand what Republicans knew and what Democrats knew, in order to find the facts. And I hope that happens sooner rather than later.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct assessment of whether the scandal has *damaged* Speaker Hastert’s *credibility* and *effectiveness* in preserving party control during the upcoming midterm elections.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response talks about the Speaker’s “strong statements,” the desire to “find out the facts,” and condemns the behavior, but it never states whether the scandal has *damaged* his credibility or *effectiveness*. The answer remains at the level of general statements about wanting facts and condemnation, without addressing the specific impact on Hastert’s political standing.

3. **Information type** – The requested information is not provided in a clear, explicit form. Instead, the answer is vague, general, and deflects from the core question.

4. **Evasion check** – The respondent does not decline to answer nor does he claim ignorance; rather, he sidesteps the specific query by discussing unrelated aspects (the Speaker’s declarations, the need to uncover facts). This is a classic case of deflection.

5. **Classification decision** – Because the answer offers only partial, implicit, and deflective commentary rather than a direct, complete response, it fits the **Ambivalent** category: the information is given but incompletely and indirectly.

139,Performance of Ben Bernanke,"Q. Right here, sir. Switching gears slightly, in light of the financial regulation and reform that you have made, what is--how do you rate the performance of the Fed in handling the financial crisis? And more specifically, how do you rate the performance of Ben Bernanke, and would you like him to stay on when his term ends in January?","I'm not going to make news about Ben Bernanke--[]--although I think he has done a fine job under very difficult circumstances.I would say that all financial regulators didn't do everything that needed to be done to prevent the crisis from happening. And that's why we've put forward the boldest set of reforms in financial regulation in 75 years, because there were too many gaps; where there were laws on the books that would have brought about a prevention of the crisis, the enforcement wasn't there. In some cases, there just weren't sufficient laws on the books, for example, with the nonbanking sector.I think that the Fed probably performed better than most other regulators prior to the crisis taking place, but I think they'd be the first to acknowledge that in dealing with systemic risk and anticipating systemic risk, they didn't do everything that needed to be done.I think since the crisis has occurred, Ben Bernanke has performed very well. And one of the central concepts behind our financial regulatory reform is that there's got to be somebody who is responsible not just for monitoring the health of individual institutions, but somebody who's monitoring the systemic risks of the system as a whole. And we believe that the Fed has the most technical expertise and the best track record in terms of doing that.But that's not the only part of financial regulation. One of the things that we're putting a huge amount of emphasis on is the issue of consumer protection, whether it's subprime loans that were given out because nobody was paying attention to what was being peddled to consumers, whether it's how credit cards are handled, how annuities are dealt with, what people can expect in terms of understanding their 401(k)s. There's a whole bunch of financial transactions out there where consumers are not protected the way they should, and that's why we said, we're going to put forward a consumer financial protection agency whose only job it is to focus on those issues.Now, the Fed was one of the regulators that had some of those consumer responsibilities. We actually think that they're better off focusing on issues of broad systemic risk, and we have just one agency that's focused on the consumer protection side.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It requests an evaluation of Ben Bernanke’s performance (and, implicitly, whether the speaker wants him to stay on).  
2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee explicitly states:  
   - “I think he has done a fine job under very difficult circumstances.”  
   - “I think since the crisis has occurred, Ben Bernanke has performed very well.”  
   These statements directly rate his performance.  
3. **Is the information explicit?** – Yes. The rating (“fine job,” “performed very well”) is given in clear, unambiguous language. The answer does not refuse to answer, nor does it leave the evaluation vague; it provides a straightforward positive assessment.  
4. **Does it fully answer the question?** – It answers the performance‑rating part directly. It does not address the follow‑up about whether he should stay on, but the specific classification target is only the *performance* evaluation, which is fully supplied.  

Because the requested evaluation is explicitly stated, the response fits the **Clear Reply** category.

141,Inquiring about the results of the talks,"Q. Have you discussed proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missile delivery, and what are the results of your talks?","We sure have. We talked about our concerns about developing a nuclear weapon or having the capacity to make a nuclear weapon, and we talked about North Korea. And the results of our talks are that we agree that we've got to work together to send a common message to both that there is a better way forward for these leaders.And so we're working with Russia and our partners to develop Security Council resolutions that will send a clear message. One thing is for certain, that if the ians see that the United States and Russia are working together on this issue, they'll understand the seriousness of our intent.And so we spent time talking about the issue—sure did. We understand that a grave threat that faces countries like America and Russia would be—is the ability of a terrorist organization to end up with a weapon of mass destruction. Both nations have had to deal with terrorism; both nations know what it's like to see people blown up. Russia suffered through one of the most horrible terrorist incidents in modern mankind, which is Beslan, where terrorists are willing to kill young children to achieve political objectives. And the President and I understand that when you make that kind of attitude with a weapon of mass destruction, you could be talking about greater catastrophe. And so we spent a lot of time talking about it.I think relations between the United States and Russia are very good. There's a lot of skeptics on both sides of the equation as to whether or not the relationship is good. We've got people in Russia questioning U.S. motives, people in America questioning Russian motives. But that's what happens when you have—when you're big nations that have got influence, where you've got leaders willing to make tough decisions. And I would characterize, from my perspective, that our relationship is strong and necessary. That's the point I want to make to you, that a strong relationship will make the world a better place, in my judgment, because we'll be better able to confront the current problems that face us all. I have already mentioned that we will not participate in any crusades, in any holy alliances. This is true. I reaffirm our position in this matter. But our common goal is to make the world a more secure place, and certainly we'll be working with all our partners, including the United States, in order to address this problem. It is for this reason that we are joining our efforts with other G-8 countries.And I have to say that this is not some kind of plot against a particular country, where a certain problem emerges, be it missile or nuclear proliferation. We are seeking not only for the possibility of controlling this or that process; we are seeking opportunities for ensuring their legal access to nuclear technology. It is to this end that we have adopted our joint initiative on the creation of international centers for uranium enrichment and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. These are not unilateral actions aimed at trying to block somebody's access to something. This is a search for solutions that could ensure development in the world, at the same time would make the development secure in terms of nuclear nonproliferation and missile nonproliferation.We're satisfied with the level of exchanges at the working level, which we have achieved in terms of bilateral cooperation. At the summit's end, in the context of the U.N. Security Council, we will continue our work tonight and tomorrow in the course of our discussion with our partners who are arriving in St. Petersburg.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants to know *what the outcomes were* of the conversation that was just discussed. In other words, “What were the results of the talks?”

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee explicitly states the results:
   - “the results of our talks are that we agree that we’ve got to work together to send a common message…”
   - They mention agreeing to work with Russia and partners to develop Security Council resolutions that send a clear message.
   - They note that the joint effort signals seriousness to “the ians” and underscores the shared concern about weapons of mass destruction.

   These statements directly answer the question about the *results* of the talks.

3. **Is the information explicit?** – Yes. The interviewee does not merely hint or give a vague impression; they use explicit language (“the results of our talks are that we agree…”) to convey the concrete outcomes.

142, Do Americans and the rest of the world wonder if the strategy being followed is flawed based on Colin Powell's statement?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, former Secretary of State Colin Powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism. If a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Secretary of State feels this way, don't you think that Americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether you're following a flawed strategy?","If there's any comparison between the compassion and decency of the American people and the terrorist tactics of extremists, it's flawed logic. I simply can't accept that. It's unacceptable to think that there's any kind of comparison between the behavior of the United States of America and the action of Islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective, Terry.My job, and the job of people here in Washington, DC, is to protect this country. We didn't ask for this war. You might remember the 2000 campaign. I don't remember spending much time talking about what it might be like to be a Commander in Chief in a different kind of war. But this enemy has struck us, and they want to strike us again. And we will give our folks the tools necessary to protect the country; that's our job.It's a dangerous world. I wish it wasn't that way. I wish I could tell the American people, Don't worry about it; they're not coming again. But they are coming again. And that's why I've sent this legislation up to Congress, and that's why we'll continue to work with allies in building a vast coalition to protect not only ourselves but them. The facts are—is that after 9/11, this enemy continued to attack and kill innocent people.I happen to believe that they're bound by a common ideology. Matter of fact, I don't believe that, I know they are. And they want to impose that ideology throughout the broader Middle East. That's what they have said. It makes sense for the Commander in Chief and all of us involved in protecting this country to listen to the words of the enemy. And I take their words seriously.

1. **What the question asks**  
   - The interviewer wants to know whether the public (Americans and the world) is beginning to question the administration’s strategy, specifically because former Secretary of State Colin Powell has expressed doubt.  
   - The expected answer would address that doubt directly – e.g., “Yes, there is concern,” or “No, there is no such concern,” or a brief comment on public perception.

2. **How the answer responds**  
   - The interviewee launches into a broad defense of the administration’s approach, repeatedly rejecting any comparison between U.S. actions and terrorist tactics.  
   - The response talks about “flawed logic,” the need to protect the country, the enemy’s intentions, and the administration’s actions, but **never directly addresses the question of whether Americans or the world are wondering about a flawed strategy**.  
   - Instead, the answer sidesteps the specific query about public doubt and shifts to a generic justification of policy.

3. **Evaluation against the classification categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – The answer does **not** explicitly state whether people are wondering about a flawed strategy.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – The answer does provide some related content (rejecting the comparison), but it does **not** give the requested judgment about public perception; it merely deflects.

I think the opportunity is that when you have the kinds of people who were in Tahrir Square, feeling that they have hope and they have opportunity, then they're less likely to channel all their frustrations into anti-Israeli sentiment or anti-Western sentiment, because they see the prospect of building their own country.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct assessment: *Has the situation made it more complicated in your mind?* The expected answer would be a clear “yes,” “no,” or a straightforward statement about whether complexity has increased.

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee does not give a simple yes/no. Instead, they discuss both an *opportunity* and a *challenge*, describing the challenge as “democracy is messy” and noting that negotiating with a democracy requires dealing with many views. They then say they “like the odds of actually getting a better outcome in the former circumstance than in the latter.” This touches on the idea of complexity but does not directly answer whether it *has* made things more complicated; it merely frames the situation in terms of pros and cons.

3. **Information provided** – The response is **partial and implicit**. It offers a nuanced view rather than a clear, explicit answer to the specific query. The core question is left unresolved; the answer is more of a general commentary than a direct reply.

4. **Classification decision** – Because the answer is incomplete, indirect, and does not explicitly state whether the situation has made things more complicated, it falls under the **Ambivalent** category (information is given in an incomplete/partial way, involving deflection or indirectness).

144, Concerns about the U.S. policy leading to a flood of hot money in the Korean economy.,"Q. President Lee, on the same subject? President Lee, do you have any concerns about that U.S. policy might lead to a flood of hot money coming into the Korean economy?","I think that kind of question should be asked to me when President Obama is not standing right next to me. []No, we get asked a very similar question. And I answer it this way: I tell those who ask me that question that, first and foremost, what's most important for us and for everyone around the world, including the Americans, is for the U.S. economy to be robust, to recover, and to continue to grow. That is critically important for the entire global economy if they wish to get on the path of sustainable and balanced growth.Now, I know that there have been certain decisions taken by the U.S. Government and the Federal Reserve. And I know that those decisions were made with due consideration for everything else.And you asked me a question about the influx of hot money into the Korean economy. I don't see any possibility of this happening or such an event becoming destabilizing for the Korean economy. But what I would want to emphasize is that such a measure--decision taken by the U.S. Government, we hope that it will be a positive contribution to the recovery and the revival of the U.S. economy. We know that this has been talked about in Pittsburgh. And that is, namely, the fact of adopting an indicative guideline or a framework for ensuring strong and sustainable growth.And we know that these and other topics of interest will be included in the Seoul communique as well. And we know that are making progress on this through cooperation. I'd also emphasize another point, and that is the importance of international cooperation.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants to know whether President Lee is worried that U.S. policy could cause a large influx (“flood”) of “hot money” into the Korean economy.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – President Lee directly answers the concern:
   - He says, *“I don’t see any possibility of this happening or such an event becoming destabilizing for the Korean economy.”*
   - This statement explicitly says he has **no concern** about that specific outcome.

3. **Is the information explicit?** – Yes. The answer contains a clear, unambiguous statement about the existence (or lack) of concern regarding the “flood of hot money.” It does not merely hint or give a vague comment; it outright declares that such a flood is not a problem.

4. **Is there evasion or deflection?** – While the response also discusses broader topics (U.S. economic recovery, international cooperation, etc.), the core question is answered directly. The additional remarks do not obscure the explicit answer to the concern.

5. **Classification decision** – Because the requested information (the stance on the concern about hot‑money inflows) is **explicitly stated**, the response fits the **Clear Reply** category.

That's his choice to make.Chris. Or, Paul [Paul Mieke, Channel 7 TV]. Paul.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step reasoning**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants the interviewee’s *assessment of the job performance* of “him.” In other words, the respondent should give a clear evaluation of how well the person is doing in his role.

2. **What the answer contains** –  
   - The speaker does say, “I thought in Washington, he handled the case with professionalism… I really thought he handled himself well.”  
   - However, the response also veers into unrelated material (plans to reappoint, the Attorney General’s choice, etc.) and does not give a concise, overall judgment of the person’s job performance.  
   - The assessment offered is **partial** (it focuses only on a single case) and is **wrapped in deflection** (the speaker talks about future reappointment decisions rather than delivering a straightforward evaluation).

3. **Matching the classification criteria**  
   - **Clear Reply** – would require the requested information to be *explicitly* and *directly* stated in the form asked. The answer does not give a straightforward, complete assessment; it is fragmented and interspersed with unrelated remarks.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – would apply if the respondent gave *no* answer at all (e.g., “I don’t know”). Here, an answer is given, albeit incomplete.  
   - **Ambivalent** – fits when the information is supplied *in an incomplete, partial, or indirect way* (i.e., it is too general, dodges the core request, or only partially addresses it). The response meets this description: it offers a vague, case‑specific appraisal and then deflects to other issues.

**Conclusion:** The response provides a **partial, indirect evaluation** rather than a clear, complete assessment, fitting the definition of an *Ambivalent* answer.

It also includes unrelated statements about reappointment, etc. The answer does give an assessment, albeit partial and somewhat indirect. It\'s not a clear explicit statement like ""He is doing a good job"" but it does give an assessment: ""I thought he handled himself well"" and ""he handled the case with professionalism"".

The question wants an assessment of the job performance. The answer provides an assessment, albeit somewhat indirect but still explicit. It\'s not a non-reply because it does answer. It\'s not ambivalent because it does give a clear assessment (though partial). It\'s not incomplete? It gives some assessment but also deflects. However the question likely expects a direct assessment; the answer does give some assessment but also includes unrelated content. I\'d classify as Ambivalent? Let\'s examine definitions: Ambivalent - information requested is given in an incomplete way (e.g., answer is too general, partial, implicit, dodging, or deflection). The answer does give some assessment but also deflects with talk about reappointment and not knowing. It is somewhat partial and includes deflection. It does give an assessment though. The question: ""Assessment of the job performance"". The answer: ""I thought he handled himself well... he handled the case with professionalism."" That\'s an assessment. It\'s explicit enough? It\'s explicit but also includes other stuff. It\'s not incomplete; it\'s a partial answer but includes the requested info. I\'d lean to Clear Reply because the assessment is explicitly stated. However the answer also includes deflection and doesn\'t fully answer the question about overall job performance, just about handling a case. But still it\'s an explicit statement of assessment. The classification likely expects Ambivalent if it\'s partial/general. The answer is not a clear yes/no but gives some evaluation. The categories: Clear Reply - explicitly stated in requested form. The answer does state ""I thought he handled himself well"" which is an assessment. That is explicit. So I\'d say Clear Reply.\n\nBut the presence of deflection might be considered Ambivalent. The question is about assessment of the job performance. The answer gives an assessment of how he handled a case, not overall job performance. It\'s partial and indirect. That fits Ambivalent: incomplete, partial, deflection. I\'d choose Ambivalent.\n\nThus classification: Ambivalent.\n'}]",Clear Reply
146,Discussing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missile delivery,"Q. Have you discussed proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missile delivery, and what are the results of your talks?","We sure have. We talked about our concerns about developing a nuclear weapon or having the capacity to make a nuclear weapon, and we talked about North Korea. And the results of our talks are that we agree that we've got to work together to send a common message to both that there is a better way forward for these leaders.And so we're working with Russia and our partners to develop Security Council resolutions that will send a clear message. One thing is for certain, that if the ians see that the United States and Russia are working together on this issue, they'll understand the seriousness of our intent.And so we spent time talking about the issue—sure did. We understand that a grave threat that faces countries like America and Russia would be—is the ability of a terrorist organization to end up with a weapon of mass destruction. Both nations have had to deal with terrorism; both nations know what it's like to see people blown up. Russia suffered through one of the most horrible terrorist incidents in modern mankind, which is Beslan, where terrorists are willing to kill young children to achieve political objectives. And the President and I understand that when you make that kind of attitude with a weapon of mass destruction, you could be talking about greater catastrophe. And so we spent a lot of time talking about it.I think relations between the United States and Russia are very good. There's a lot of skeptics on both sides of the equation as to whether or not the relationship is good. We've got people in Russia questioning U.S. motives, people in America questioning Russian motives. But that's what happens when you have—when you're big nations that have got influence, where you've got leaders willing to make tough decisions. And I would characterize, from my perspective, that our relationship is strong and necessary. That's the point I want to make to you, that a strong relationship will make the world a better place, in my judgment, because we'll be better able to confront the current problems that face us all. I have already mentioned that we will not participate in any crusades, in any holy alliances. This is true. I reaffirm our position in this matter. But our common goal is to make the world a more secure place, and certainly we'll be working with all our partners, including the United States, in order to address this problem. It is for this reason that we are joining our efforts with other G-8 countries.And I have to say that this is not some kind of plot against a particular country, where a certain problem emerges, be it missile or nuclear proliferation. We are seeking not only for the possibility of controlling this or that process; we are seeking opportunities for ensuring their legal access to nuclear technology. It is to this end that we have adopted our joint initiative on the creation of international centers for uranium enrichment and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. These are not unilateral actions aimed at trying to block somebody's access to something. This is a search for solutions that could ensure development in the world, at the same time would make the development secure in terms of nuclear nonproliferation and missile nonproliferation.We're satisfied with the level of exchanges at the working level, which we have achieved in terms of bilateral cooperation. At the summit's end, in the context of the U.N. Security Council, we will continue our work tonight and tomorrow in the course of our discussion with our partners who are arriving in St. Petersburg.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It requests a discussion of two specific topics:  
   - Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  
   - Missile delivery (i.e., the means of delivering such weapons).

2. **How the answer addresses those topics** – The interviewee:  
   - Explicitly mentions concerns about “developing a nuclear weapon” and “the capacity to make a nuclear weapon.”  
   - Brings up North Korea as a case of proliferation.  
   - Describes the outcomes of the talks: agreement to work together, issuing a common message, developing Security‑Council resolutions, and coordinating with Russia.  
   - Links the issue to missile delivery by noting that a terrorist group could acquire a WMD and that the “ability of a terrorist organization to end up with a weapon of mass destruction” would be a grave threat, implying discussion of delivery means.  
   - Provides concrete details about the content of the conversation and the agreed‑upon actions.

3. **Is the information explicit and complete?** – Yes. The response directly answers the question by stating what was discussed (WMD proliferation, North Korea, missile‑delivery concerns) and what the results were (joint messaging, Security‑Council resolutions, cooperation with Russia). It does not evade, deflect, or remain vague; it gives a clear, substantive answer.

148,Are you worried that the steps European leaders are taking are too incremental so far?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Chancellor Merkel said this week that Europe is in its toughest hour since World War II. Markets are now showing some anxiety about the possibility of instability spreading to France as well. Are you worried that the steps European leaders are taking are too incremental so far? Do you think something bolder or a more difficult set of decisions need to be taken to fully ring-fence that crisis?I have a question for Prime Minister Gillard as well. Are you concerned that the fiscal pressures the United States is under at the moment may compromise its ability to sustain its plans for the region, including the initiatives announced today? Do you have to take those with something of a grain of salt until the supercommittee process is concluded?","With respect to Europe, I'm deeply concerned, have been deeply concerned, I suspect we'll be deeply concerned tomorrow and next week and the week after that. Until we put in place a concrete plan and structure that sends a clear signal to the markets that Europe is standing behind the euro and will do what it takes, we're going to continue to see the kinds of turmoil that we saw in the markets today--or was it yesterday? I'm trying to figure out what--[]--what time zone I'm in here. It's all of the time. All of the--right. [] We have consulted very closely with our European friends. I think that there is a genuine desire on the part of leaders like President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel to solve this crisis. But they've got a complicated political structure.The problem right now is a problem of political will; it's not a technical problem. We saw some progress with Italy and Greece both putting forward essentially unity governments that can implement some significant reforms that need to take place in those countries. But at this point, the larger European community has to stand behind the European project. And for those American readers or listeners, and those Australian readers or listeners, I think we all understand at this point, we've got an integrated world economy and what happens in Europe will have an impact on us.So we are going to continue to advise European leaders on what options we think would meet the threshold where markets would settle down. It is going to require some tough decisions on their part. They have made some progress on some fronts, like their efforts to recapitalize the banks. But ultimately, what they're going to need is a firewall that sends a clear signal: We stand behind the European project, and we stand behind the euro. And those members of the euro zone, they are going to have the liquidity they need to service their debt. So there's more work to do on that front.And just--I don't want to steal your question, but I do want to just say, with respect to our budget, there's a reason why I'm spending this time out here in Asia and out here in the Pacific region. First and foremost, because this is the fastest growing economic region in the world, and I want to create jobs in the United States, which means we've got to sell products here and invest here and have a robust trading relationship here, and Australia happens to be one of our strongest trading partners.But the second message I'm trying to send is that we are here to stay. This is a region of huge strategic importance to us. And I've been--I've made very clear, and I'll amplify in my speech to Parliament tomorrow, that even as we make a whole host of important fiscal decisions back home, this is right up there at the top of my priority list. And we're going to make sure that we are able to fulfill our leadership role in the Asia-Pacific region. And I was just going to make what I think is the commonsense point. I'm not going to issue words of advice about the fiscal position in the United States, but the commonsense point from the point of view of the leader is, ultimately, budgets are about choices and there are hard choices about the things you value. And I think, by President Obama being here, he is saying he values the role of the United States in this region and our alliance, and that's what the announcement we've made today is all about.We've got a question from Mark Riley from the Australian media.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

Now, maybe he's going to bring it up over lunch, but he didn't bring it up earlier. Let me just begin by saying—— Interesting question, though. Let me just begin by saying that—first of all, the question was asked earlier, I think, is a threat. I don't think the issue is whether is a threat. clearly wants to be a threat. And I think—I just want to repeat what the President has said. Given that that's a society of the kind of nature it is, I think this should concern us immensely, and the fact that it is prepared to arm itself and prepared to threaten to use such armaments—I think it is something that we should be gravely concerned about, as was said earlier.Missiles that are fired in the direction of the United States constitute a threat to Canada. That's one of the reasons why our Government renewed, on a permanent basis, the NORAD treaty. Through NORAD we have a special relationship on air defense and we share information on these kind of matters. I think as you know, to answer your specific question, the Government of Canada is not prepared to open a missile defense issue at this time, but I will say that I think it should be obvious, when we look at this kind of threat, why the United States and others would want to have a modern and flexible defense system against this kind of threat.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer explicitly requests that the Prime Minister answer the question *in both French and English*. The required information is a simple yes/no (or confirmation) that the PM can respond in both languages.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The lengthy response never states whether the Prime Minister can or cannot answer in both languages. Instead, it veers into unrelated political commentary, repeats prior statements, and ends with a generic “Welcome. Thank you for your birthday greetings.” The core request—confirmation of bilingual response—is ignored.

3. **Information type** – Because the answer provides *no* direct answer to the question, the requested information is absent. This matches the definition of a **Clear Non‑Reply**: the information is not given, not due to lack of knowledge but because the respondent declines to answer the specific query.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The response deflects entirely from the question rather than offering a partial or ambiguous answer. It does not give a partial answer; it gives *no* answer.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee directly answers the question:
   - He labels the candidates’ stance as “wrong.”
   - He explicitly states that waterboarding “is torture” and “contrary to America’s traditions” and “our ideals.”
   - He affirms that the practice was ended and that the U.S. does not need it to fight terrorism.
   - He concludes that anyone who understands waterboarding would agree it is torture, thereby rejecting the candidates’ defense.

3. **Information type** – The requested opinion is **explicitly stated** in the requested form (i.e., a clear judgment that the candidates are wrong and that waterboarding is torture). There is no evasion, deflection, or vague/partial wording that leaves the core question unanswered.

4. **Evasion check** – The response does not dodge or deflect; it confronts the allegation head‑on and provides a definitive stance.

**Conclusion:** The answer provides a clear, explicit reply to the question about the President’s opinion on the Republican candidates defending waterboarding.

151,Does the administration and our Government run a risk of looking feckless to the world by issuing these kinds of warnings regularly without response from the countries?,"Q. You said yesterday in your statement that the North Korean nuclear test was unacceptable. Your chief negotiator for the six-party talks said last week that North Korea has a choice of either having weapons or having a future. When you spoke a month or so ago to the American Legion, you talked about Iran and said, There must be consequences for Iran's defiance, and we must not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. I am wondering, sir— your administration has issued these kinds of warnings pretty regularly over the last 5 years, and yet these countries have pursued their nuclear programs. I'm wondering if you—what is different about the current set of warnings, and do you think the administration and our Government runs a risk of looking feckless to the world by issuing these kinds of warnings regularly without response from the countries?","That's a fair question. First of all, I am making it clear our policy hasn't changed. It's important for the folks to understand that we don't continually shift our goals based upon polls or whatever. See, I think clarity of purpose is very important to rally a diplomatic effort to solve the problem. And so I try to speak as clearly as I can and make sure there's no ambiguity in our position. I also found that's a pretty good way to help rally a diplomatic effort that I believe will more likely work.I know this sounds—I'm just saying it over and over again, but it's—rhetoric and actions are all aimed at convincing others that they have an equal stake in whether or not these nations have a nuclear weapon, because I firmly believe, Mike, that that is the best strategy to solve the problem. One has a stronger hand when there's more people playing your same cards. It is much easier for a nation to hear what I believe are legitimate demands if there's more than one voice speaking. And that's why we're doing what we're doing.And to answer your question as to whether or not the words will be empty, I would suggest that, quite the contrary, that we not only have spoken about the goals, but as a result of working together with our friends, Iran and North Korea are looking at a different diplomatic scenario.I thought you were going to ask the question, following up on Sanger, how come you don't use military action now? You kind of hinted it; you didn't say it. And some wonder that. As a matter of fact, I'm asked questions around the country— just go ahead and use the military. And my answer is, is that I believe the Commander in Chief must try all diplomatic measures before we commit our military. And I believe the diplomacy is—we're making progress when we've got others at the table.I'll ask myself a followup. If that's the case, why did you use military action in Iraq? And the reason why is because we tried the diplomacy. Matter of fact, we tried resolution after resolution after resolution. All these situations are—each of them different and require a different response, a different effort to try to solve this peacefully. And we'll continue to do so.The inability to convince people to move forward speaks volumes about them. It ought to say to all the world that we're dealing with people that maybe don't want peace—which, in my judgment, in order for there to be peace, requires an international response. It says volumes about a person who signs an agreement with one administration and signs an agreement or speaks about an agreement with another administration and doesn't honor the agreement. It points up the fact that these are dangerous regimes and requires an international effort to work in concert.Roger [Roger Runningen, Bloomberg News].",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct assessment of whether the administration’s repeated warnings, without observable responses from target states, make the U.S. appear “feckless” to the international community.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not give a straightforward yes/no or a concise judgment. Instead, the response:
   - Shifts focus to the administration’s consistent policy and “clarity of purpose.”
   - Emphasizes rallying diplomatic support and the need for multiple voices.
   - Argues that the warnings are not empty because other nations are changing their behavior.
   - Deflects to broader themes of diplomacy versus military action.
   - Ends with a vague statement about “what it says about them” rather than directly answering the risk question.

3. **Information provided** – The answer is **partial and implicit**. It touches on the underlying rationale for the warnings but never explicitly states whether the administration fears looking feckless, nor does it directly answer the query.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The response largely **deflects** from the specific concern about perception, offering a broader justification rather than a clear assessment.

**Conclusion:** The response is neither a full, explicit answer nor a complete non‑reply; it offers an incomplete, somewhat evasive answer that leaves the question only partially addressed.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct assessment of whether the administration’s policy toward Iraq is consistent with its policy toward North Korea.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee talks at length about:
   - The importance of exhausting diplomatic options before using force.
   - The UN resolutions concerning Iraq and the “disarm, disclose, or face consequences” language.
   - The need to speak clearly and mean what one says.
   - That the same approach is now being applied to North Korea (the “diplomatic process now with …”).

   However, the response never explicitly states **whether** the policies are consistent or not. It provides background information and describes the diplomatic approach to both countries, but it stops short of giving a clear judgment on consistency.

3. **Information type** – The answer is **partial** and **implicit**. It supplies related context but does not directly answer the yes/no/assessment question that was asked. It is more of a deflection that sidesteps the specific query.

4. **Evasion check** – Yes. Rather than answering the consistency question head‑on, the speaker shifts to a broader discussion of diplomatic strategy and historical examples, leaving the original question unanswered.

**Conclusion:** The response is incomplete and indirect; it offers relevant background but does not clearly answer the question. This fits the definition of an **Ambivalent** reply.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct assessment of whether the United States can sustain simultaneous military operations on three separate fronts (Iraq, Afghanistan, and North Korea).

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response does not answer that logistical or strategic question at all. Instead, it:
   - Repeats general statements about exhausting diplomatic options,
   - Recounts historical events (e.g., the Iraq‑UN resolutions),
   - Discusses the nature of diplomacy and the slowness of international processes,
   - Ends with a vague comment about “painful” diplomacy but never evaluates the nation’s capacity to fight on three fronts.

3. **Information type** – The answer is **partial and indirect**. It touches on related themes (diplomacy, consequences, coalition‑building) but never provides the requested judgment about sustaining three simultaneous wars. The response is deliberately evasive and leaves the question unanswered.

4. **Evasion vs. ignorance** – The interviewee is not lacking knowledge; rather, they are avoiding a direct answer, which fits the definition of a **dodging/deflection** response.

5. **Classification decision** – Because the answer supplies only vague, general remarks and fails to give a clear, explicit response to the specific query, it falls under the **Ambivalent** category: the information is given incompletely, in a partially implicit and deflecting manner.

2. **What the answer provides** – The interviewee replies with a single word: **“Please.”**  
   - This does **not** answer the substantive question.  
   - It does not give any information, explanation, or clarification about the possibility of returning to North Korea.  
   - Instead, it is a polite request for the interviewer to continue speaking or to ask something else.

3. **Matching to the classification categories**

   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – Defined as “the information requested is not given at all due to ignorance, need for clarification, or declining to answer.” The response “Please” is precisely a non‑answer that signals a need for clarification or a refusal to answer, fitting the definition of a Clear Non‑Reply.

And what you're offering the Arab nations to encourage them to participate?,"Right.

In other words, as she said the other day, this isn't going to be just a photo opportunity. This is going to be a serious and substantive meeting.We believe that now is the time to push ahead with a meeting at which the Israelis and Palestinians will lay out a vision of what a state could look like. And the reason why there needs to be a vision of what a state could look like is because the Palestinians, that have been made promises all these years, need to see there's a serious, focused effort to step up a state. And that's important so that the people who want to reject extremism have something to be for.So this is a serious attempt. And I'm pleased with the progress. And the reason I'm pleased is because it appears to me that President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert are, one, talking—I know they're talking a lot—but they're making progress. And in order for there to be lasting peace, the deal has to be good for the Palestinians as well as the Israelis. Our job is to facilitate the process.Another reason I have an international meeting is to get Arab buy-in for a state. In other words, part of the issue in the past has been that the Arab nations stood on the sidelines, and when a state was in reach, they weren't a part of the process encouraging the parties to move forward. And so this is a—that's what I mean by comprehensive. It's comprehensive not only for what the state will look like; it's comprehensive in getting people in the region to be a part of the process.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a clear, concise statement of the *minimum* condition that would make the speaker consider the conference a success. In other words, the interviewer wants a concrete threshold or benchmark.

2. **How the answer responds** – The speaker launches into a broad description of the goals of the meeting (comprehensive peace, serious and substantive discussion, a vision of a future state, Arab buy‑in, etc.). While these points relate to the overall purpose of the conference, the answer never isolates or explicitly states a *minimum* expectation that would signal success. Instead, it offers general aspirations and vague assurances.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct assessment of the interviewee’s attitude toward the number of pardons he has granted: *“Do you consider yourself to be stingy when it comes to pardons?”*  
   The expected answer would be a clear statement—either “Yes, I am stingy,” “No, I am not stingy,” or a brief explanation of his view on the matter.

2. **What the answer actually does** – The interviewee:
   - Mentions that he “doesn’t have the criterion in front of me” and that there is a “strict criterion” used by the Justice Department and White House Counsel.  
   - Says he “hasn’t compared the number of pardons I’ve given … to any other President.”  
   - States that “a scorecard should, necessarily, be the guidepost for pardoning people.”  
   - Then shifts to addressing other reporters, never providing a direct yes/no or explanatory answer to the stinginess question.

3. **Is the requested information given explicitly?** – No. The response never states whether the interviewee considers himself stingy. It only talks about criteria and the irrelevance of a “scorecard,” which is a deflection rather than a direct answer.

4. **Is the answer a non‑reply because of ignorance or refusal?** – Not exactly. The interviewee is not refusing to answer out of ignorance; rather, he is avoiding a direct response by pivoting to a broader discussion of criteria and moving on to other questions.

5. **Does the answer provide incomplete or indirect information?** – Yes. The reply is vague, indirect, and deflects from the specific yes/no query. It offers partial context (criteria, lack of comparison) but does not answer the core question.

**Conclusion:** The response is incomplete and evasive—it does not directly answer whether the interviewee considers himself stingy, but instead offers a general, indirect commentary. This fits the definition of an **Ambivalent** response.

And do you see that—is there any security plan that can really curb the religious violence?,"Q. Thank you very much, Mr. Prime Minister. General Abizaid said that the danger that Iraq is facing is the religious danger. Do you agree with his assessment? And do you see that—is there any security plan that can really curb the religious violence?[Inaudible]—humanitarian aid to Lebanon, yet there's also reports that your administration are speeding up delivery of laser-guided missiles to Israel and bunker-buster bombs. And do you see this—if this is true, do you see it as contradictory? On one hand, you allow Israel to kill people, and civilian, in particular, and on the other hand, you're trying to aid the very people that have been suffering and killed as a result?","No, I don't see a contradiction in us honoring commitments we made prior to Hizballah attacks into Israeli territory. And I—like the Prime Minister, I'm concerned about loss of innocent life, and we will do everything we can to help move equipment—I mean, food and medicines to help the people who have been displaced and the people who suffer. Yes. I do not reduce the risk and the danger of the religious feelings, especially through some of the organizations that are trying to promote this hatred. And there are—some of the events are on the basis of religious divide, but I would like to assure the political, religious leaders, and civil societies that the Iraqi parties, politicians, religious leaders are rising to their responsibility and are condemning those who are cooperating with Al Qaida and those who are trying to start a civil war.The one—the most important element in the security plan is to curb the religious violence, because we will not allow any Iraqis to use this background. This is one of the main objective of the security plan. It is the policy of the Government: There is no killing or discrimination against anyone. Everything is by law and everything based on the Constitution and the law. The Government responsibility is to protect all Iraqis, regardless of their ethnic or religious background. It's important to say that we are shedding the light against those who are calling for sectarian religious, because we feel that this is a great danger to Iraq. And, God willing, there will be no civil war in Iraq.Thank you very much. Thank you.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks**  
   - The interviewer wants a direct response to two linked queries:  
     a) Do you agree with General Abizaid’s assessment that the danger facing Iraq is “religious danger”?  
     b) Is there a security plan that can actually curb the religious violence?

2. **How the answer addresses each part**  
   - **Agreement with the assessment:** The interviewee says, *“I do not reduce the risk and the danger of the religious feelings, especially through some of the organizations that are trying to promote this hatred.”* This acknowledges that the religious danger is real and significant, i.e., they **agree** with the assessment.  
   - **Existence of a security plan to curb the violence:** The interviewee explicitly states, *“The one—the most important element in the security plan is to curb the religious violence… This is one of the main objective of the security plan.”* Thus they **confirm** that a security plan exists and that its primary goal is to curb religious violence.

3. **Clarity and completeness**  
   - The response directly answers both sub‑questions with clear, affirmative language.  
   - It does not hedge, deflect, or remain vague; it explicitly states agreement and describes the security plan’s objective.  
   - While the answer is broader than a one‑sentence reply, it provides the requested information in an explicit form.

4. **Classification decision**  
   - The answer meets the definition of a **Clear Reply**: the requested information (agreement with the assessment and existence of a security plan to curb religious violence) is explicitly stated.

**LABEL: Clear Reply**","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to that specific question: ""General Abizaid said that the danger that Iraq is facing is the religious danger. Do you agree with his assessment? And do you see that—is there any security plan that can really curb the religious violence?"" The answer given is a long paragraph. We need to see if it\'s a clear reply (explicitly states agreement or disagreement and mentions security plan), clear non-reply (no answer), or ambivalent (partial, incomplete, dodging). The answer does address the religious danger: ""I do not reduce the risk and the danger of the religious feelings, especially through some of the organizations that are trying to promote this hatred."" It also mentions security plan: ""The one—the most important element in the security plan is to curb the religious violence, because we will not allow any Iraqis to use this background. This is one of the main objective of the security plan."" So it does answer both parts: it says they do not reduce the risk, acknowledges religious danger, and says the security plan aims to curb religious violence. It is fairly explicit. It\'s not vague or incomplete; it gives a clear answer: they agree that religious danger exists and that the security plan aims to curb it. It\'s somewhat general but still explicit.

159,Dealing with dangerous suspects,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You've said that you wanted to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, but you were waiting for the Supreme Court decision that came out today. Do you intend now to close the Guantanamo Bay quickly? And how do you deal with the suspects that you've said were too dangerous to be released or sent home?","Thank you for the question on a court ruling that literally came out in the midst of my meeting with the Prime Minister—and so I haven't had a chance to fully review the findings of the Supreme Court. I, one, assure you that we take them very seriously; two, that to the extent that there is latitude to work with the Congress to determine whether or not the military tribunals will be an avenue in which to give people their day in court, we will do so.The American people need to know that this ruling, as I understand it, won't cause killers to be put out on the street. In other words, there's not a—it was a drive-by briefing on the way here; I was told that this was not going to be the case. At any rate, we will seriously look at the findings, obviously. And one thing I'm not going to do, though, is I'm not going to jeopardize the safety of the American people. People have got to understand that. I understand we're in a war on terror, that these people were picked up off of a battlefield. And I will protect the people and, at the same time, conform with the findings of the Supreme Court.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants to know the interviewee’s plan or stance on how to handle detainees who are judged “too dangerous to be released or sent home.” The expected answer would specify concrete measures (e.g., continued detention, trial procedures, transfer options, legal safeguards, etc.).

2. **What the answer provides** –  
   - The speaker acknowledges the Supreme Court ruling and says they will “seriously look at the findings.”  
   - They assert they will “protect the safety of the American people” and that “these people were picked up off a battlefield.”  
   - They mention using “military tribunals” as a possible avenue, but only in the abstract (“to the extent that there is latitude to work with the Congress… we will do so”).  
   - No explicit description of how dangerous suspects will be dealt with is given; the response is vague, defensive, and shifts focus to broader safety and legal considerations rather than a concrete handling policy.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – The answer does **not** explicitly state a policy or plan for dealing with dangerous suspects; it remains general.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – The answer does provide some related information (e.g., mention of tribunals, safety concerns), so it is not a total refusal or ignorance.  
   - **Ambivalent** – The response is **incomplete and indirect**: it touches on the issue but does so in a vague, defensive, and partially evasive manner, offering only partial, implicit information rather than a clear, concrete answer.

**Conclusion:** The response is incomplete and partially evasive, fitting the definition of an *Ambivalent* answer.

160,Why not talk to Syria and Iran directly about this crisis and have a back-and-forth conversation?,Q. Many strategists say that we'll never get to the bottom of this crisis unless the U.S. engages directly with Syria and Iran. Why not talk to them directly about this and have a back-and-forth conversation?,"Yes, that's an interesting question. I've been reading about that, that people have been posing that question. We have been in touch with Syria. Colin Powell sent a message to Syria in person. Dick Armitage traveled to Syria. Bill Burns traveled to Syria. We've got a consulate office in Syria. Syria knows what we think. The problem isn't us telling Syria what's on our mind, which is to stop harboring terror and to help the Iraqi democracy evolve. They know exactly what our position is. The problem is, is that their response hasn't been very positive. As a matter of fact, it hasn't been positive at all.And in terms of Iran, we made it clear to the Iranians that if they would honor previous obligations and verifiably stop enrichment of nuclear materials, we would sit at a table. And so there's a way forward for both countries. The choice is theirs. Now, I appreciate people focusing on Syria and Iran, and we should, because Syria and Iran sponsor and promote Hizballah activities—all aimed at creating chaos, all aimed at using terror to stop the advance of democracies.Our objective, our policy is to give voice to people through democratic reform, and that's why we strongly support the Siniora Government. That's why I've articulated a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians, two democracies living side by side in peace. That's why Condi went to see President Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Territories, to assure him that we're committed to a democracy. That's why we're making sacrifices in Iraq—to build democracy.In other words, we believe democracy yields peace. And the actions of Hizballah, through its sponsors of Iran and Syria, are trying to stop that advance of democracy. Hizballah launched this attack. Hizballah is trying to create the chaos necessary to stop the advance of peace. And the world community must come together to address this problem.Let's see here.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct explanation of why the United States has not engaged in a direct, back‑and‑forth conversation with Syria and Iran regarding the crisis.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not evade the question. Instead, they:
   - State that the U.S. *has* been in contact with both countries (e.g., Powell, Armitage, Burns, a consulate in Syria).
   - Explain that the U.S. has clearly communicated its positions (stop harboring terror, support Iraqi democracy; halt nuclear enrichment).
   - Note that the other side’s response has been “not very positive.”
   - Offer the conditional “choice is theirs” and outline the diplomatic pathway (engage if Iran verifiably stops enrichment).
   - Provide the broader policy rationale (promoting democracy, confronting Hizballah’s destabilizing actions).

3. **Information type** – The response supplies explicit reasons and concrete examples of prior contact and conditions, directly answering the “why not” query.

4. **Evasion check** – There is no refusal, ignorance, or vague deflection; the answer is substantive and directly addresses the premise of the question.

**Conclusion:** The interviewee gives a clear, explicit answer to the question.

161,Why shouldn't we see the cease-fire as one that essentially is falling apart?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Back to Lebanon. The Lebanese Prime Minister, over the weekend, said that Israel flagrantly violated the cease-fire with its raid into Lebanon. And so far, the European allies who've committed forces, the U.N. security peacekeeping forces, have expressed reservations; those Muslim nations who've offered troops have been shunned by Israeli officials. Why shouldn't we see the cease-fire as one that essentially is falling apart? And what makes this more than a piece of paper if you don't have the will of the international community to back it up?","Yes. No, listen—all the more reason why we need to help our friends and allies get the forces necessary to help the Lebanese forces keep the cessation of hostilities in place, intact.

And so it's an ongoing series of conversations and discussions, and hopefully, this will happen quite quickly.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking for a direct justification: *Why shouldn't we view the cease‑fire as essentially falling apart?* They want an explanation of why the cease‑fire is still viable despite reported violations and lack of international support.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not directly answer the “why” of the cease‑fire’s viability. Instead, they pivot to a broader statement about:
   - Helping friends and allies provide forces for Lebanon,
   - Ensuring a robust, well‑engaged force,
   - Ongoing conversations and discussions,
   - Hoping this will happen quickly.

   The response mentions “cessation of hostilities” but never explicitly states why the cease‑fire is *not* falling apart, nor does it refute the premise that it is. It offers a vague, indirect justification rather than a clear, targeted explanation.

3. **Information type** – The answer provides only a partial, generalized response. It touches on related themes (support for Lebanese forces, robust engagement) but leaves the core question unanswered. The reply is therefore incomplete and somewhat evasive.

4. **Evasion check** – The interviewee deflects from the specific query about the cease‑fire’s status and instead discusses ancillary actions (allied forces, rules of engagement). This is a classic deflection rather than a straightforward answer.

**Conclusion:** The response is neither a full refusal to answer nor a clear, explicit reply; it is an incomplete, partially deflecting answer that does not directly address the question.

162,Don't you worry that that undermines U.S. credibility?,"Q. Mr. President, thank you. I'd like to follow on that. When you talked about Iraq, you and others in the administration talked about a mushroom cloud; then there were no WMD in Iraq. When it came to Iran, you said in October—on October 17th, you warned about the prospect of world war III, when months before you made that statement, this intelligence about them suspending their weapons program back in '03 had already come to light to this administration. So can't you be accused of hyping this threat? And don't you worry that that undermines U.S. credibility?","David, I don't want to contradict an august reporter such as yourself, but I was made aware of the NIE last week. In August, I think it was, John McConnell—Mike McConnell came in and said, We have some new information. He didn't tell me what the information was; he did tell me it was going to take a while to analyze. Why would you take time to analyze new information? One, you want to make sure it's not disinformation. You want to make sure the piece of intelligence you have is real. And secondly, they want to make sure they understand the intelligence they gathered. If they think it's real, then what does it mean? And it wasn't until last week that I was briefed on the NIE that is now public.And the second part of your question has to do with this: Look, was dangerous; is dangerous; and will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon. The NIE says that had a hidden—a covert nuclear weapons program. That's what it said. What's to say they couldn't start another covert nuclear weapons program? And the best way to ensure that there—that the world is peaceful in the future is for the international community to continue to work together to say to the ians, we're going to isolate you. However, there is a better way forward for the ians.Now, in 2003, the ian Government began to come to the table in discussions with the EU-3, facilitated by the United States. In other words, we said to the EU- 3, we'll support your efforts to say to the ians, you have a choice to make: You can continue to do policy that will isolate you, or there's a better way forward. And so that was the sticks-and-carrots approach.You might remember, the United States said at that point in time, we'll put the WTO on the table for consideration, or we'll help you with spare parts for your airplanes. It was all an attempt to take advantage of what we thought was a more openminded ian regime at the time— a willingness of this regime to talk about a way forward. And then the ians had elections, and Ahmadi-nejad announced that—to the IAEA that he was going to— this is after, by the way, the ians had suspended their enrichment program—he said, We're going to stop the suspension; we'll start up the program again. And that's where we are today.My point is, is that there is a better way forward for the ians. There has been a moment during my Presidency in which diplomacy provided a way forward for the ians. And our hope is we can get back on that path again. But what is certain is that if ever had the knowledge to develop a nuclear weapon and they passed that knowledge on to a covert program, which at one time in their history has existed, the world would be more dangerous. And now is the time for the international community to work together.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking a direct, evaluative question: *“Don’t you worry that that undermines U.S. credibility?”*  
   - The expected response would be a clear statement about whether the speaker is concerned that the administration’s actions (e.g., the Iraq “mushroom‑cloud” rhetoric, the Iran intelligence handling) could damage U.S. credibility, and perhaps an explanation of that concern.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee launches into a long, tangential narrative about intelligence briefings, the NIE, Iran’s nuclear program, and diplomatic strategy.  
   - The answer never directly answers the question “Do you worry that this undermines U.S. credibility?”  
   - It instead discusses unrelated topics (intelligence analysis, Iran’s behavior, diplomatic “sticks‑and‑carrots”) and offers no explicit admission or denial of any credibility concern.

3. **Information type** – The response is **incomplete and indirect**. It provides related context but does not give the requested judgment about credibility. The core question is left unanswered; the speaker deflects rather than addresses it head‑on.

4. **Evasion check** – Yes. The speaker sidesteps the specific concern about credibility by shifting to a broader discussion of intelligence assessment and diplomatic policy. This is a classic case of deflection/partial answer.

163,"In light of the recent political tumult in Greece causing Americans to lose what they had gained back in their 401(k)s, are you confident that the bailout plan will actually happen and if so, will it work?","Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm curious what you would say to Americans back home who've watched their 401(k)s recover largely when the bailout seemed a certainty, and then this week with the brand new political tumult in Greece, watched themselves lose essentially what they had gained back. You mentioned you're confident in the bailout plan. Are you confident this will actually happen, and if so, that it will work?","Well, first of all, if you're talking about the movements of the U.S. stock market, the stock market was down when I first took office and the first few months I was in office about 3,000 points lower than it is now. So nothing has happened in the last 2 weeks that would suggest that somehow people's 401(k)s have been affected the way you describe.Am I confident that this will work? I think that there's more work to do. I think there are going to be some ups and downs along the way. But I am confident that the key players in Europe--the European political leadership--understands how much of a stake they have in making sure that this crisis is resolved, that the euro zone remains intact, and I think that they are going to do what's necessary in order to make that happen.Now, let's recognize how difficult this is. I have sympathy for my European counterparts. We saw how difficult it was for us to save the financial system back in the United States. It did not do wonders for anybody's political standing, because people's general attitude is, you know what, if the financial sector is behaving recklessly or not making good decisions, other folks shouldn't have to suffer for it.You layer on top of that the fact that you're negotiating with multiple parliaments, a European Parliament, a European Commission--I mean, there are just a lot of institutions here in Europe. And I think several--I'm not sure whether it was Sarkozy or Merkel or Barroso or somebody, they joked with me that I'd gotten a crash course in European politics over the last several days. And there are a lot of meetings here in Europe as well. So trying to coordinate all those different interests is laborious, it's time consuming, but I think they're going to get there.What is also positive is, if there's a silver lining in this whole process, it's the fact that I think European leaders recognize that there are some structural reforms, institutional modifications they need to make if Europe and the euro zone is to be as effective as they want it to be.I think that what this has exposed is that if you have a single currency but you haven't worked out all the institutional coordination and relationships between countries on the fiscal side, on the monetary side, that that creates additional vulnerabilities. And there's a commitment on the part of European leaders, I think, to examine those issues. But those are long term. In the short term, what they've got to do is just make sure that they're sending a signal to the markets that they stand behind the euro.And if that message is sent, then I think this crisis is averted, because some of this crisis is psychological. Italy is a big country with a enormous industrial base, great wealth, great assets, and has had substantial debt for quite some time; it's just the market is feeling skittish right now. And that's why I think Prime Minister Berlusconi's invitation to the IMF to certify that the reform plan that they put in place is one that they will, in fact, follow is an example of the steady, confidence-building measures that need to take place in order for us to get back on track.Norah O'Donnell [CBS News]./Small Businesses",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

164,Does the tension between two allies undermine the efforts of getting bin Laden?,Q. The tension between two allies—does this undermine the efforts of getting bin Laden?,"No. No, it doesn't. It's in President Karzai's interest to see bin Laden brought to justice. It is in President Musharraf's interest to see bin Laden brought to justice. Our interests coincide. It will be interesting for me to watch the body language of these two leaders to determine how tense things are. I'll be good. [] Yes. From my discussions with President Karzai and President Musharraf, there is an understanding that by working together, it is more likely that all of us can achieve a common objective, which are stable societies that are hopeful societies, that prevent extremists from stopping progress and denying people a hopeful world.I know that's what President Karzai thinks, and I know that's how President Musharraf thinks. And so—I'm kind of teasing about the body language for the dinner tomorrow night, but it's going to be a good dinner, and it's an important dinner.So to answer your question, no. What you perceive as tension is stopping us from bringing high-value targets to justice, quite the contrary, we're working as hard as ever in doing that. On the question of Waziristan, ma'am, President Musharraf, when he was in Kabul, explained what they had done there. My initial impression was that this was a deal signed by the Taliban, and then later I learned that they actually signed with the tribal chiefs. It will have a different meaning if it is that signed with the tribal chiefs—that for us, for the United States, for the allies against terror.The most important element here is item number one in this agreement, that the terrorists will not be allowed to cross over into Afghanistan to attack the coalition against terror, that is, the international community and Afghanistan together. We will have to wait and see if that is going to be implemented exactly the way it is signed. So from our side, it's a wait-and-see attitude. But generally, we will back any move, any deal that will deny terrorism sanctuary in North Waziristan or in the tribal territories of Pakistan. Mr. President, thank you. Thank you, sir.

3. **Information provided** – The core information requested (the answer to the yes/no query) is explicitly stated: the tension does **not** undermine the effort. The response also supplies supporting reasoning, but the key point is clearly and directly given.

4. **Evasion or incompleteness?** – There is no evasion, deflection, or vague/partial answer. The question is answered head‑on with a clear “No,” followed by justification.

**Conclusion:** The response explicitly states the requested information in the form asked.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a clear justification for the speaker’s view that sending additional resources to hunt down Osama bin Laden would be a bad idea. The answer should explain the reasons (e.g., sovereignty, intelligence limits, strategic priorities).

2. **What the answer provides** –  
   - It begins with a vague acknowledgment (“We are, Richard…”) and then shifts to a discussion of Pakistan’s sovereignty, the need for an invitation, and the importance of intelligence.  
   - It then pivots to a broader narrative about the administration’s focus on bin Laden, calling criticism a “urban myth,” and asserts that the hunt is already ongoing “in a smart fashion.”  
   - The response never directly addresses the premise that sending *more* resources is a *bad idea*; instead it deflects, reframes, and offers partial, indirect reasons (sovereignty, intelligence, existing effort) without explicitly stating why additional resources would be unwise.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – No. The answer does not explicitly state a reason why sending more resources is a bad idea; it does not give a straightforward justification in the requested form.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – No. Some relevant information is offered (sovereignty, intelligence, existing hunt), so the answer is not a total non‑reply.  
   - **Ambivalent** – Yes. The response is incomplete and indirect; it touches on related points but leaves the core question unanswered, using deflection and general statements rather than a clear, targeted explanation.

**Conclusion:** The response is **Ambivalent** – it provides only a partial, indirect, and somewhat evasive answer to the question.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct judgment on whether it is fair to characterize the war on terror as being supported by *either* “everyone who wants to fight it” *or* “no one at all.” The expected answer would be a clear yes/no or an explicit assessment of fairness.

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee does not answer the fairness question head‑on. Instead, they shift the discussion to:
   - Using “the words of the people in Congress or their votes” as a basis for characterization.
   - Citing a specific legislative vote (the Hamdan legislation) and a political opponent’s statement about Iraq.
   - Explaining that they “characterize” positions based on votes or words.

   The response never states whether it is *fair* to portray the war on terror in the binary way asked; it merely explains *how* the speaker uses votes/words to describe positions.

3. **Information provided** – The answer is **partial and indirect**. It offers related context (votes, characterizations) but does not give a clear, explicit stance on the fairness of the binary portrayal. It is therefore incomplete with respect to the requested judgment.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The reply deflects from the specific fairness query and instead talks about methodology of characterization. This fits the definition of an **ambivalent** response: the information is given but in an incomplete, indirect, and somewhat evasive manner.

Is it now past the deadline, or do they still have more time to respond?",I thought you were going to ask me about the pig.,Clear Non-Reply,"**Step‑by‑step reasoning**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct answer about whether a deadline has passed or if more time is still available for Iran’s response.

2. **What the interviewee says** – The interviewee replies, “I thought you were going to ask me about the pig.”  
   - This response does **not** address the deadline question at all.  
   - It provides no information, no clarification, and does not decline to answer in a way that signals ignorance; it simply sidesteps the question entirely.

   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – Occurs when the information is not given because the respondent declines to answer, is ignorant, or otherwise fails to provide the requested response. The interviewee gives no answer to the deadline query, effectively refusing to address it. → *Matches this category.*

1. **What the question asks** – “Can we hold you to that?” is a request for a clear affirmation or commitment that the speaker will be bound by a prior statement/ promise. The expected answer would be a direct yes/no or a restatement of the commitment.

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee replies with unrelated, vague remarks about “coming back to the bosom of the White House,” looking forward to hugging, and asks “When are you coming back?” None of this addresses the request to be held to a prior statement or promise. The response sidesteps the question rather than answering it.

3. **Information provided** – The answer does not give the requested commitment; it merely deflects with generic, off‑topic comments. It is therefore incomplete and evasive.

4. **Classification decision** –  
   - **Clear Reply** – No, because the requested information (a commitment) is not explicitly stated.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – No, because the interviewee does provide some response (though irrelevant).  
   - **Ambivalent** – Yes, because the answer is given but it is incomplete, general, and deflects from the question, fitting the definition of an incomplete/implicit/deflective response.

169, Assessing the cooperation between the two Presidents: Have there been more pluses or minuses?,"Q.

I would like to ask you, if you assess your work, have there been more pluses or minuses? And please tell me, what have you achieved, and what concrete things will be bequeathed to your successors? Do you think the world has become a safer and more secure place? And how has the U.S.-Russian relationship influenced world politics?And my question to the United States now—to the President of the United States now—you have met President-elect today— Dmitry Medvedev. You talked about the impression you have of him. I would like to ask you, did you discuss the schedule of your further exchanges with him in the course of this year—for the remaining part of this year?","Okay, I will start answering. Has it become better, or has it become worse? We always want to have more of a good thing, and we shouldn't forget that the—as we say, the better is the worst enemy of the good.Let us remember the world on the brink of a nuclear disaster during the Caribbean crisis, and now let us look at the U.S.Russia relationship today. A crisis like the Cuban crisis would not be possible now; it would be unthinkable. I agree with George when he said that Russia and the United States no longer consider each other as enemies. At a minimum, they look at each other as partners, and I believe this is very important.Of course, a lot of outstanding issues remain. It is true that we do have disagreements on some sensitive areas of our cooperation, but at the same time, we do have enough strength to search for solutions. And as our meeting today has shown, we are capable of achieving positive re-sults—that is, on the whole—in counterterrorism, in fighting proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missile technology, of fighting the drug threat. All of these create a reliable platform for cooperation, not only between Russia and the United States but a platform that contributes to ensuring international security.If we mention on top of that our economic cooperation, we can state that in the past 8 years, we have been able to improve the relations between our two countries and in the world as a whole. Yes, I agree with that answer. And secondly, I spent—I told President-elect that I would see him in Japan at the G-8, and that's the only scheduling matters that we discussed. And I'm going to finish out my term—my time with Vladimir, and then I'll turn my attention to the President when he gets to be the President. But the first time I suspect we'll meet will be in the scheduled meeting in Japan.Thank you.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct assessment of the overall outcome of the two Presidents’ cooperation: whether there have been more “pluses” (positive achievements) or “minuses” (shortcomings), and wants concrete examples of what will be left for successors and how it has affected world security.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee explicitly comments on the evaluation:
   - “Has it become better, or has it become worse? … we always want to have more of a good thing…”
   - “…we have been able to improve the relations between our two countries…”
   - “Yes, I agree with that answer.”
   - The speaker also lists concrete areas of cooperation (counter‑terrorism, non‑proliferation, missile technology, drug threat) that illustrate the positive side.

3. **Information type** – The response **states** that the cooperation has resulted in more positives (“improve the relations… we have been able to improve… we are capable of achieving positive results”), thereby directly answering the “pluses vs. minuses” query. The answer is not vague in the sense of refusing to answer; it actually declares that the overall assessment is positive.

4. **Evasion or incompleteness?** – The reply does not dodge the question nor remain silent. It may be somewhat general, but it **explicitly** gives the assessment that there are more pluses than minuses and cites concrete achievements.

**Conclusion:** The interviewee provides a clear, explicit answer to the question about whether there have been more pluses or minuses in the Presidents’ cooperation.

**Classification:** **Clear Reply**","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to the specific question: ""Assessing the cooperation between the two Presidents: Have there been more pluses or minuses?""

And in addition to that, sir, what kind of threat do you think North Korea poses to world peace right now?","Nontransparent societies run by Governments that aren't selected by the people are—very difficult to tell what's going on. That's part of the problem. We're dealing with a person who was asked not to fire a rocket by the Chinese, the South Koreans, the United States, the Japanese, and the Russians. And he fired seven of them, which then caused the Secretary of State and myself to get on the phone with our partners and reminded them that—of the importance of speaking with one voice.It's to—saying to Kim Jong Il, there is a better way forward for you than isolating yourself from the rest of the world; that there is a opportunity for you to stick to some of your agreements, and that is to verifiably disarm; and that there will be a better life than being isolated and, most importantly, a better life for your people than isolation will bring.And so I was on the phone this morning with Hu Jintao and President Putin, and last night I talked to Prime Minister Koizumi and President Roh. And my message was that we want to solve this problem diplomatically, and the best way to solve the problem diplomatically is for all of us to be working in concert and to send one message, and that is—to Kim Jong Il—that we expect you to adhere to international norms, and we expect you to keep your word.One way to send a message is through the United Nations. And the Japanese laid down a resolution which we support. But we're working with our partners to make sure we speak with one voice. Diplomacy takes a while, particularly when you're dealing with a variety of partners. And so we're spending time diplomatically making sure that voice is unified.I was pleased from the responses I got from the leaders. They, like me, were— are concerned, concerned about a person who doesn't seem to really care about what others say. And so we're working it, working it hard. And it's—and by the way, an effective policy is one which is not just the United States trying to solve problems. So I spent time talking to the Canadian Prime Minister about it. I mean, Canada is a, should be, and must be an active participant in helping deal with problems.He brought up Haiti, for example, in the Oval Office. Canada has made a significant contribution to stability in Haiti in the past.

They believe that there's, no question, violence; they believe that Al Qaida is still creating havoc; they know there's people taking reprisal; they're confident there are still Saddamists who are threatening people and carrying out attacks.But they also believe that the Baghdad security plan is making progress. There was a lot of discussion about Al Anbar Province recently, and I spent some time talking with our commanders. No question, it's a dangerous place. It's a place where Al Qaida is really trying to root themselves; it's a place from which they'd like to operate. You know, this business about Al Qaida, Al Anbar's loss is just not the case; it's not what our commanders think.So to answer your question, there's no question, it's tough.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct assessment of whether it is appropriate to label the situation in Iraq as a “civil war,” i.e., a clear yes/no (or equivalent) answer, and possibly an explanation of the threshold for using that label.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee explicitly states that “the Iraqi Government just don’t agree with the hypothesis it is a civil war.” This is a direct response to the question. The speaker also outlines the criteria they use to evaluate the situation (e.g., unity government progress, political plan, reconciliation, security forces), thereby providing the “threshold” discussion that the question requests.

3. **Information type** – The requested information is given **explicitly**:  
   - The government does **not** consider Iraq a civil war.  
   - The speaker describes the factors they examine to judge the situation.

4. **Evasion or incompleteness?** – There is no evasion or vague deflection; the answer directly answers the question and supplies the needed explanation. It is not a non‑reply (the answer is not missing) and it is not merely partial or ambiguous; it provides a clear stance and the basis for that stance.

**Conclusion:** The response supplies the information requested in an explicit, straightforward manner.

See, that's the whole purpose of the force, is to strengthen the Lebanese Government by helping the Lebanese force move into the area. The whole cornerstone of the policy for Lebanon is for Lebanon to be free and able to govern herself and defend herself with a viable force.And so one of the things you'll see in discussions there is, how do we help the Lebanese Army succeed? What does it— what's required? What's the manpower need to be in order to help this force move into the south so the government can take control of the country. What it looks like— if I hold a press conference on Tuesday, I'll be able to answer that better. But since I probably won't be, read your newspaper.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a clear answer about *who* should lead the multinational force (i.e., the leadership structure).

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee talks generally about “developing a consensus,” about the force complementing the Lebanese army, and about “how do we help the Lebanese Army succeed.”  
   - The response mentions the *purpose* of the force and the *process* (consensus‑building) but never names a specific individual, country, or body that would lead it.  
   - It remains at the level of “what the force ought to look like” rather than answering the *leadership* question directly.

3. **Information type** – The answer provides only a vague, indirect reference to leadership (“people will put forth ideas… we’ll participate…”) and does not give the explicit, concrete answer the question seeks. It is therefore incomplete and indirect.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker shifts to a broader discussion of consensus and future press conferences, effectively avoiding a definitive statement on who should lead the force.

**Conclusion** – The response is not a clear, explicit answer; it is partial, implicit, and deflects from the specific request. This fits the definition of an **Ambivalent** response.

173,How do you punish or penalize a country that's already among the poorest and most isolated in the world?,"Q. Harsh. Mr. President, Japan has dropped the threat of sanctions from its proposed Security Council resolution about North Korea. Why was that necessary? And how do you punish or penalize a country that's already among the poorest and most isolated in the world?","I think that the purpose of the U.N. Security Council resolution is to send a clear message to the leader of that the world condemns that which he did. Part of our strategy, as you know, has been to have others at the table, is to say as clearly as possible to the n, Get rid of your weapons, and there's a better way forward. In other words, there's a choice for him to make. He can verifiably get rid of his weapons programs and stop testing rockets, and there's a way forward for him to help his people.I believe it's best to make that choice clear to him with more than one voice, and that's why we have the six-party talks. And now that he has defied China and Japan and South Korea and Russia and the United States—all of us said, don't fire that rocket. He not only fired one; he fired seven. Now that he made that defiance, it's best for all of us to go to the U.N. Security Council and say loud and clear, here are some red lines. And that's what we're in the process of doing.The problem with diplomacy, it takes a while to get something done. If you're acting alone, you can move quickly. When you're rallying world opinion and trying to come up with the right language at the United Nations to send a clear signal, it takes a while.And so yesterday I was on the phone with—I think I mentioned this to the press conference yesterday—to Hu Jintao and Vladimir Putin; the day before to President Roh and Prime Minister Koizumi. And Condi, by the way, was making the same calls out there to her counterparts, all aiming at saying, It's your choice, Kim Jong Il; you've got the choice to make.So we'll see what happens at the U.N. Security Council. I talked to Condi this morning first thing, in anticipation of this question, and she feels good about the progress that can be made there.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a concrete description of the methods or mechanisms the speaker would use to punish or penalize a country that is already “among the poorest and most isolated in the world.”

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response talks about:
   - Using the U.N. Security Council to send a “clear message.”
   - The need for “more than one voice” and “red lines.”
   - Diplomatic outreach to various leaders.
   - The idea that the target has a choice to abandon weapons programs.
   - General statements about the difficulty of diplomacy and the time it takes.

   The answer never spells out *how* a poor, isolated country would actually be punished or penalized (e.g., economic sanctions, military action, specific diplomatic measures). Instead, it offers a broad, indirect discussion of diplomatic strategy and messaging.

3. **Information type** – The response is **partial and implicit**. It touches on the topic but does so in a vague, generalized way, without providing the explicit answer the question demands. It functions more as a deflection or elaboration on the broader context rather than a direct answer.

4. **Evasion check** – There is clear deflection: the speaker shifts from the specific punitive question to a discussion of multilateral messaging and diplomatic process, avoiding a straightforward description of punishment.

**Conclusion:** The answer provides only an incomplete, indirect, and somewhat evasive treatment of the question rather than a clear, explicit reply or a complete non‑reply.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants the interviewee’s explicit reaction to two specific Chinese officials’ statements:  
   * (a) that the U.S. must be involved in the six‑party talks, and  
   * (b) that the U.S. should stop focusing on money‑laundering and instead address the “real issue” of ballistic missiles.

2. **What the answer contains** – The response talks about:  
   * Counterfeiting U.S. dollars (a tangential point).

Did you discuss what you could move on—in North Korea to move it forward?And, President Putin, is Russia now willing, if necessary, to vote for sanctions in the United Nations to stop Iran's nuclear preparations?","We strategized on both issues. But this isn't the first time that we've talked together to—on how to solve problems. You might remember that Russia proposed a very interesting way forward for . It was the Putin Government that said to the ians, If you want a civilian nuclear power program, we will support you in that; however, we will provide the fuel, and we'll collect the spent fuel. I thought it was a very innovative approach to solving the problem. I strongly supported the initiatives.So, Bill [Bill Plante, CBS News], to answer your question, this isn't the first time that we have strategized on how to solve this problem. And, yes, we talked about the U.N. Security Council resolution. And, no, I'm not going to tell you the particulars about the conversation. I will tell you, however, that there is common agreement that we need to get something done at the U.N., and I'm confident we will be able to do that. And there's agreement that we need to get something done on North Korea at the United Nations.Here's the thing, though, just so that everybody understands: Diplomacy is not two countries just saying, this is the way it is. Diplomacy is two countries agreeing to work together with other countries, in this case, to come up with common language that we can live with that sends the same message, and that is, no nuclear weapons programs.Our goal and objective is to have a nuclear-free—nuclear weapons-free Korean Peninsula. Russia shares that objective, China shares the objective, Japan shares the objective, and South Korea shares the objective. So we've got common ground to move forward, and now we're working on language. And it was a very constructive meeting. You know, I have spoken on this count for many times. I can repeat, it is not in Russia's national interest to see a proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, especially in such an explosive region as the Middle East.This is something that we tell our ian partners directly. We have always told them about it. There is nothing novel or new about our position in this respect. But we work on the assumption that we have to find efficient ways of ensuring security around the world.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants to know whether the interviewee *discussed* possible actions or “what you could move on” regarding North Korea in order to advance the diplomatic effort.

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee explicitly says:
   - “we talked about the U.N. Security Council resolution… and … we need to get something done on North Korea at the United Nations.”
   - “we’ve got common ground to move forward, and now we’re working on language.”
   - “Our goal … is to have a nuclear‑free Korean Peninsula… Russia shares that objective… we’re satisfied with the status of the U.S.–Russia relationship in this area.”

   These statements directly address the question: they confirm that a discussion about moving forward on North Korea took place and describe the nature of that discussion (working on language, seeking common ground, etc.).

3. **Is the information explicit?** – Yes. The answer states plainly that the conversation *did* involve moving forward on North Korea and outlines the steps being taken (working on language, seeking common agreement at the UN). It does not hide or deflect; it provides the requested substance.

4. **Is it incomplete or evasive?** – While the answer is broad, it is not vague to the point of omission. It gives a clear affirmative response that a discussion occurred and identifies the focus (moving forward on North Korea). It does not refuse to answer, nor does it merely repeat the question.

We don't think it's in their interests to send more troops in.I appreciate very much the fact that the Iraqi Government understands that this is a sensitive issue with the Turks, and that's why Vice President Hashimi is in Istanbul today talking with the Turkish leaders to assure them that Iraq shares their concerns about terrorist activities, but that there's a better way to deal with the issue than having the Turks send massive troops into the country—massive additional troops into the country.What I'm telling you is, is that there's a lot of dialog going on, and that's positive.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct judgment on whether Turkey *legitimately* has the right to conduct a cross‑border military offensive into Iraq.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not give a clear yes/no or a concise assessment of Turkey’s “legitimate right.”  
   - Instead, the response talks about U.S. communications with Turkey, U.S. concerns about sending more troops, and the need for dialogue.  
   - The speaker states that “we don’t think it is in their interests to send troops,” but never explicitly says whether Turkey *has* the legitimate right to do so.

3. **Information provided** – The answer offers related context (U.S. position, ongoing dialogue) but leaves the core question unanswered. It is therefore **partial and indirect**.

As part of that adult conversation, sir, what if they say deeper spending cuts before you consider tax hikes?","Well, I think it just depends on what exactly you're talking about. And I think that there should be a full, open debate with the American people: Are we willing to cut millions of young people off when it comes to student loans that help kids and families on their college education? Are we only serious about education in the abstract, but when it's the concrete, we're not willing to put the money into it? If we're cutting infant formula to poor kids, is that who we are as a people?I mean, we're going to have to have those debates. Particularly if it turns out that making those cuts doesn't really make a big dent in the long-term debt and deficits, then I think the American people may conclude let's have a more balanced approach.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking a conditional, hypothetical question: *“What if they say deeper spending cuts before you consider tax hikes?”* It expects a direct response about how the speaker would react or what the policy stance would be under that scenario.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The speaker does not answer the conditional at all. Instead, they:
   - Offer a generic comment about “a full, open debate with the American people.”
   - Shift the focus to unrelated topics (student‑loan cuts, infant‑formula assistance, abstract vs. concrete education funding).
   - Talk about future debates and predictions, without ever stating a position on “deeper spending cuts before tax hikes.”

3. **Information provided** – The response is **partial and vague**. It mentions “deeper spending cuts” only in passing, but never explains what would happen if such cuts were proposed before tax hikes. The answer is largely a deflection to broader rhetorical points.

4. **Evasion or deflection?** – Yes. The speaker avoids the specific hypothetical and instead discusses unrelated policy concerns and the need for debate. This matches the definition of an **ambivalent** response: the information is given but in an incomplete, indirect, and deflecting manner.

5. **Conclusion** – The answer does not constitute a clear reply (it does not explicitly answer the question) nor a clear non‑reply (the speaker does not refuse to answer outright; they merely give a tangential, incomplete answer). Therefore it fits the **Ambivalent** category.

178,Was President Karzai able to convince the person in their meetings that Iran was playing a helpful role in Afghanistan?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. President Karzai said yesterday that he believed Iran was playing a helpful role in Afghanistan. Was he able to convince you in your meetings that that was the case, or do you still have concerns about Iran's role?And I have a question for President Karzai as well. I'm just wondering if the President was able to give you the assurances that you sought about the effort to reduce civilian casualties in Afghanistan?","Let me comment on the civilian casualties, if I might. First, I fully understand the angst, the agony, and the sorrow that Afghan citizens feel when an innocent life is lost. I know that must cause grief in villages and heartbreak in homes.Secondly, I can assure the Afghan people, like I assured the President, that we do everything that we can to protect the innocent; that our military operations are mindful that innocent life might be exposed to danger, and we adjust accordingly.Thirdly, it is the Taliban who surround themselves with innocent life as human shields. The Taliban are the coldblooded killers. The Taliban are the murderers. The Taliban have no regard for human life. And therefore, we've spent some time talking about—as the President rightly expressed— his concerns about civilian casualty. And I assured him that we share those concerns.Secondly, it's up to Iran to prove to the world that they're a stabilizing force, as opposed to a destabilizing force. After all, this is a Government that has proclaimed its desire to build a nuclear weapon. This is a Government that is in defiance of international accord, a Government that seems to be willing to thumb its nose at the international community and, at the same time, a Government that denies its people a rightful place in the world and denies its people the ability to realize their full potential. So I believe that it's in the interests of all of us that we have an Iran that tries to stabilize, not destabilize, an Iran that gives up its weapons ambitions. And therefore, we're working to that end.The President knows best about what's taking place in his country, and of course, I'm willing to listen. But from my perspective, the burden of proof is on the Iranian Government to show us that they're a positive force. And I must tell you that this current leadership there is a big disappointment to the people of Iran. I mean, the people of Iran could be doing a lot better than they are today. But because of the actions of this Government, this country is isolated. And we will continue to work to isolate it because they're not a force for good, as far as we can see. They're a destabilizing influence wherever they are.Now, the President will have to talk to you about Afghanistan. But I would be very cautious about whether or not the Iranian influence there in Afghanistan is a positive force. And therefore, it's going to be up to them to prove to us and prove to the Government that they are. I had a good discussion with President Bush on civilian casualties. I'm very happy to tell you that President Bush felt very much with the Afghan people, that he calls the Afghan people allies in the war against terror and friends, and that he is as much concerned as I am, as the Afghan people are.

We're asking people to do hard things, for starters, which is intercept and find terrorists and to spread freedom. And there's isolationist tendencies in this world. People would rather stay at home. People would rather not aggressively pursue people overseas and aggressively pursue freedom. I understand that. We got people like that in our own country. That's why, in my State of the Union Address a couple of years ago, I talked about the perils of isolationism and protectionism. And the fundamental question facing whoever sits in the Oval Office is, will you use the influence of the United States to advance a freedom agenda to help others realize the blessings of liberty and yield peace?So I don't want people to get the wrong impression of our country, but I'm not surprised we get criticized on a variety of fronts.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants to know whether the interviewee is *concerned* about the growing criticism and questions concerning how his administration handled a terrorist suspect.

2. **How the answer addresses it** –  
   - The response does mention that the administration “gets criticized a lot” and that “people would rather stay at home” and “not aggressively pursue people overseas.”  
   - It then shifts to a broader discussion of isolationism, the need to “intercept and find terrorists,” and the President’s freedom agenda.  
   - However, it never directly states *whether* the President is concerned about the specific criticism regarding the handling of the terrorist suspect. The answer is vague, deflects, and circles back to general themes rather than giving a clear assessment of his level of concern.

3. **Information type** – The answer provides only partial, implicit commentary on criticism, but it does not explicitly answer the question about *concern* regarding the terrorist‑suspect handling. It is therefore incomplete and somewhat evasive.

180, Is the issue of cotton still a sensitive issue in Benin?,"Q. Hi, I'm from the Beninese national radio. Mr. President, since you have been in power, you have done trips to the United States and Benin. Last time, you discussed with President Bush of the issue of cotton, American subsidies to their farmers in that country. And we saw with which enthusiasm you tackled this issue because, indeed, cotton is one of the pillars of the Beninese economy. So based on this visit, and up until today, have these things evolved? But is the issue of cotton still a sensitive issue?","I must confess that when we started these discussions, we on purpose did not talk about this, because the President asked us, What is your country ailing of? And I didn't bring up cotton. It's he himself who asked: What about this cotton business? What's going on with cotton? And I thanked him profusely for that.So, of course, he shared his vision with us, and he is encouraging us to diversify the sources of solutions to the problem that we have today, namely the cotton industry. He is aware that in our subregion—when we, for example, look at West Africa, and you add Central Africa to that, and a— one citizen out of two lives out of that industry. So I do believe of the workers in Burkina Faso and Mali, Niger and Togo, elsewhere, Senegal—and quite naturally, I think of my compatriots who commit themselves everyday that gives them into this line of business.So, Mr. President, I was expecting that the press would indeed bring up this issue because anybody who decides to fight on behalf of Africa against poverty cannot be— allow the cotton industry to deteriorate or to disappear. I do believe that there's a strong correlation between the health of the cotton industry and the prosperity of our countries.So you indeed gave us some advice. I could repeat some of this advice. He said, Do everything you can to bring added value. That's his first piece of advice. And he asked us to translate this into a vision, and this vision must also be part of a political vision and of a strategy. And I answered him, You are perfectly right. We ourselves—this was the direction that we have chosen for ourselves. But we are limited by various constraints, such as the shortcomings of some of our infrastructure, which are indispensable.For example, electricity: I even told him that electricity for the textile industry is basically what blood is for the human body. That we do have basic issues, basic shortcomings, in terms of energy, electricity, water, and so on, truly, and if you could help us in that regard. And he told me to—recommend to talk to OPIC, in terms of the United States, and to create a partnership between the private and public sectors to allow us to move ahead.And I reassured him, and I told him that this issue is being discussed within the communities that we have—ECOWAS—so that we can indeed come up with a subregional strategy, because our countries, taken alone, cannot do anything by themself, especially when you look at the difference in the Asian countries, in terms of their textile agencies. And practically no country in the world can compete against them.So of course, the President did not fail to follow up this question that I asked him when I was at the White House, namely the issue of subsidies. I think you are, indeed, right. Of course, he believed that this was an American issue, and that it's not even at his level that the core issue is being discussed—it's at the Senate; it's in Congress—and that in reality, his concern is to ensure that these efforts towards other countries—in order to resume the Doha cycle. It's through that Doha cycle that we'll come up with a solution. And he said, If Europe moves, if China moves, and if everyone else moves this, America moves. And I said, You're absolutely right. But there's one other issue, because when we talked about—with European leaders, they told me, Well, if America moves, we Europeans, we will move ourselves. So—and he says, Now, if Europe moves, well, we will move.So since the America is the great America, I do hope that great America will move, because I wrote to him when this issue was being debated in Congress. And I told him, truly, please intervene personally to ensure that the United States will indeed be the first to make the move.So today I applaud the fact that he did remember my request, but he did say you can count on him personally, on great America, to ensure that the Doha round will resume. And of course, we will come up with a solution to this—of world governance—to ensure that international trade can truly help the development of the poorest countries, of which we are.So that's where we are. That's in the update. I would like to thank him very much, because he was the first one, personally, to ask this question. Yes, I brought it up because it was on his mind. And look, the way to solve this issue is for the Doha round to succeed. And the United States has made moves on agricultural subsidies at the—during the negotiations. As a matter of fact, the talks were stalled earlier in my Presidency, and I gave a speech that said, we're going to move on subsidies, and we expect others to, but we'll take the first step—and have.And so we'll see what happens. These are serious negotiations, but our attitude is, is that we're willing to reduce agricultural subsidies. We just want to have access to people's markets, just like they've got to our markets. And I told the President I was fairly optimistic that we can succeed with the Doha round, and we'll keep working it.I also said that commodities—whether the United States has subsidies or not, commodities—cotton can be overproduced. There's a lot of cotton producers. And so the best way to deal with commodity swings is to be a value-added processor; take the cotton and convert it into a product people want. And that's why we got into the discussion about electricity needs and, you know, is there investment capital available. And now it's in Washington, DC, that OPIC has got some expanded programs that he ought to look into. So it was a good discussion.Ann [Ann Compton, ABC News].",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct assessment of whether the cotton issue remains a *sensitive* topic in Benin (i.e., a clear “yes” or “no” or an explicit statement on its sensitivity).

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee talks at length about cotton’s economic importance, mentions that the President raised the issue, discusses advice given, and describes infrastructure constraints. The response never states outright whether cotton is still a sensitive issue; it only implies that cotton remains important and that efforts are being made to support it.

3. **Information type** – The answer is **partial and implicit**. It touches on the topic but does not give a clear, explicit answer to the yes/no query. It is more of a general discussion about cotton’s role rather than a direct evaluation of its sensitivity.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker shifts to broader context and advice rather than answering the specific question, which fits the pattern of a **dodging/partial** response.

**Conclusion:** The response provides an incomplete, indirect answer to the question, fitting the definition of an *Ambivalent* reply.

And this is one of these issues that requires international consensus. People will put forth ideas, and we'll participate, in terms of trying to help develop a consensus about what the force ought to look like.In a general sense, though, the force needs to serve as a complement to a Lebanese force. See, that's the whole purpose of the force, is to strengthen the Lebanese Government by helping the Lebanese force move into the area. The whole cornerstone of the policy for Lebanon is for Lebanon to be free and able to govern herself and defend herself with a viable force.And so one of the things you'll see in discussions there is, how do we help the Lebanese Army succeed? What does it— what's required? What's the manpower need to be in order to help this force move into the south so the government can take control of the country.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct answer to a specific policy query: *Should Hizballah’s agreement be a prerequisite for establishing the multinational force?* The expected response would be a clear yes/no or an explicit statement of the administration’s position on that condition.

2. **What the answer provides** – The interviewee talks generally about:
   - “the meeting Monday… international consensus”
   - “the force needs to serve as a complement to a Lebanese force”
   - “strengthening the Lebanese Government”
   - “how do we help the Lebanese Army succeed?”
   - A vague promise to answer later (“if I hold a press conference on Tuesday…”).

   The response never states whether Hizballah’s consent should be required, nor does it give any explicit policy stance on that condition. It merely discusses the broader context of forming a force and deflects to future answers.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – Not satisfied; the answer does not explicitly state the requested position.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – The interviewee does not refuse to answer outright; they do provide some related commentary, albeit indirect.

182,"Are you prepared today to agree with Prime Minister Blair and acknowledge that you have had the same expectations, which were wrong?","Q. When you and Prime Minister Blair met at the White House a few months ago, you were asked about mistakes and missteps. And he said the one mistake he made was miscalculating in thinking that a young democracy, as you put it, would be born very quickly after the fall of Saddam. Are you prepared today to agree with him and acknowledge that you've had the same expectations, which were wrong?","Actually, I think—I can't remember his answer; I'm sure you've characterized it perfectly. My attitude is that a young democracy has been born quite quickly. And I think the Iraqi Government has shown remarkable progress on the political front, and that is, is that they developed a modern constitution that was ratified by the people, and then 12 million people voted for a government—which gives me confidence about the future in Iraq, by the way.You know, I hear people say, Well, civil war this, civil war that. The Iraqi people decided against civil war when they went to the ballot box, and a unity government is working to respond to the will of the people. And frankly, it's quite a remarkable achievement on the political front, and the security front is where there have been troubles. And it's going to be up to the Maliki Government, with U.S. help, to use the trained forces and eventually a trained police force to take care of those who are trying to foment sectarian violence.We've made some progress against some of those folks, particularly when Mr. Zarqawi met his demise. Remember, Al Qaida is in the country, all attempting to stop the advance of democracy. And the blowing up of the mosque created an opportunity for those who were trying to foment sectarian violence to achieve their objective. But the Iraqi people rejected that kind of sectarian violence; the army stood strong.No question, it's still difficult. On the other hand, the political process is part of helping to achieve our objective, which is a free country, an ally in the war on terror that can sustain itself and govern itself and defend itself.Okay, who else?

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct answer: *Is the interviewee prepared today to agree with Prime Minister Blair and acknowledge that their expectations were wrong?* The expected response would be a clear “yes,” “no,” or an explicit statement confirming or denying that agreement.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does **not** answer the question directly. Instead, they launch into a broad discussion of Iraq’s political progress, elections, security, and related topics. They never state whether they agree with Blair’s assessment or acknowledge any wrong expectations.

3. **Nature of the response** – The reply is:
   - **Partial** – It mentions “young democracy” and progress in Iraq, but these points are only tangentially related to the question.
   - **Implicit / Deflective** – The speaker avoids the specific query, offering commentary rather than a straightforward acknowledgment.
   - **Incomplete** – No explicit agreement or disagreement is expressed; the core request for a judgment on Blair’s claim is left unanswered.

183,"And, President Musharraf, would Pakistan have given up its backing of the Taliban if this threat had not come from Armitage?","Q. Mr. President, after 9/11, would the United States have actually attacked Pakistan if President Musharraf had not agreed to cooperate with the war on terrorism?

The first I've heard of this was when I read it in the newspaper today. You know, I was—I guess I was taken aback by the harshness of the words.All I can tell you is, is that shortly after 9/11, Secretary Colin Powell came in and said, President Musharraf understands the stakes, and he wants to join and help rout out an enemy that has come and killed 3,000 of our citizens. As a matter of fact, my recollection was that one of the first leaders to step up and say that the stakes have changed, that attack on America that killed 3,000 of the citizens needs to be dealt with firmly, was the President. And if I'm not mistaken, Colin told us that, if not the night of September the 11th, shortly thereafter. Now, I need to make sure I get my facts straight, but it was soon.I don't know of any conversation that was reported in the newspaper like that. I just don't know about it.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking a direct, factual‑hypothetical question: *“Would Pakistan have given up its backing of the Taliban if this threat had not come from Armitage?”* It expects a clear answer about the causal relationship between the alleged threat and Pakistan’s policy toward the Taliban.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The respondent does **not** answer the hypothetical at all. Instead, he:
   - Shifts the focus to “the Armitage thing” and says he only learned about it from a newspaper.
   - Provides a vague recollection about Colin Powell and 9/11.
   - Mentions that he cannot comment because of a publishing commitment.
   - Ends with a non‑sequitur (“buy the book”).

   None of these statements address whether Pakistan would have abandoned support for the Taliban in the absence of the alleged threat.

3. **Information type** – The requested information (a yes/no or explanatory answer to the causal question) is **absent**. The response is effectively a refusal or deflection rather than an incomplete but relevant answer.

4. **Evasion vs. non‑reply** – Because the answer does not even attempt to engage with the substance of the question and instead sidesteps it entirely, it falls under the category of a *Clear Non‑Reply* rather than an Ambivalent (partial) answer.

187,Do you feel like you have been an effective leader when it comes to the economy?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. The world leaders here have stressed growth, the importance of growth. And yet growth back at home has been anemic, the new jobs report today showing just 88,000 jobs added. The Republicans in Congress have made it clear that they're going to block your jobs bill because they believe the tax hikes in it hurt small businesses. At what point do you feel that you declare stalemate to try and reach common ground? And do you feel like you have been an effective leader when it comes to the economy?","Well, first of all, wherever Republicans indicate an interest in doing things that would actually grow the economy, I'm right there with them. So they've said that passing trade bills with South Korea and Panama and Colombia would help spur growth. Those got done, with significant bipartisan support. They've suggested that we need to reform our patent laws. That's something that was part of my long-term program for economic growth; we've got that done. What I've said is all those things are nice and they're important, but if we want to grow the economy right now then we have to think bigger; we've got to do something bolder and more significant.So we put forward the American Jobs Act, which contains ideas that are historically supported by Democrats and Republicans, like rebuilding our infrastructure, our roads, and our bridges, putting teachers back in the classroom, providing tax credits to small businesses.You say, Norah, that the reason they haven't voted for them is because they don't want to tax small business. Well, actually, that's not--if that's their rationale then it doesn't fly, because the bill that they voted down yesterday, a component of the American jobs bill, essentially said we can create hundreds of thousands of jobs rebuilding our infrastructure, making America more competitive, and the entire program will be paid for by a tax not on millionaires, but people making a million dollars a year or more, which in the United States is about--a little over 300,000 people.Now, there aren't a lot of small businesses across the country that are making that kind of money. In fact, less than 3 percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year. So what they've said is, we prefer to protect 300,000 people rather than put hundreds of thousands of people back to work and benefit 300 million Americans who are hurting because of low growth.So we're going to keep on pushing. Now, there are steps that we can take absent congressional action. And the refinancing proposal that we put forward in Las Vegas is an example of that--helping students with student loans. We're going to keep on rolling out administrative steps that we can take that strengthen the economy. But if we're going to do something big to jump-start the economy at a time when it's stabilized, but unemployment is way too high, Congress is going to need to act.And in terms of my track record on the economy, here's just a simple way of thinking about it: When I came into office, the U.S. economy had contracted by 9 percent, the largest contraction since the Great Depression. Little over a year later, the economy was growing by 4 percent, and it's been growing ever since.Now, is that good enough? Absolutely not. We've got to do more. And as soon as I get some signal from Congress that they're willing to take their responsibilities seriously, I think we can do more. But that's going to require them to break out of the rigid ideological positions that they've been taking. And the same is true, by the way, when it comes to deficit reduction.We can solve all our problems. We can grow our economy now, put people back to work, reduce our deficit.

Thank you, everybody.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct assessment: *“Do you feel like you have been an effective leader when it comes to the economy?”*  
   The expected answer would be a clear statement of the interviewee’s self‑evaluation (e.g., “Yes, I believe I have been effective,” or “No, I have not been effective,” possibly with brief justification).

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee launches into a broad discussion of bipartisan legislative achievements, the American Jobs Act, tax policy, and administrative actions.  
   - The response never contains an explicit “Yes, I feel I have been an effective leader” or “No, I do not feel effective.”  
   - Instead, it offers indirect justification for various policies and deflects the question by focusing on external factors (e.g., congressional opposition, other legislative wins).  
   - The answer ends abruptly (“When I came into office, the U.S…”) and does not return to the specific self‑evaluation question.

3. **Information type** – The core request (a clear self‑assessment of effectiveness) is **not explicitly stated**. The interviewee provides related context but leaves the evaluative judgment implicit and incomplete. This fits the definition of an *ambivalent* response: the answer is given, but it is partial, indirect, and does not fully satisfy the request.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker shifts the focus to policy achievements and political obstacles rather than answering the evaluative question directly. This is a classic deflection, reinforcing the *ambivalent* classification.

**Conclusion:** The response is neither a full, explicit answer nor a complete non‑reply; it offers a partial, indirect, and deflecting answer that leaves the question unanswered in the requested form.

**LABEL:** Ambivalent","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to the specific question: ""Do you feel like you have been an effective leader when it comes to the economy?""

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants the interviewee to explain the reasoning behind a particular stance: *why would [the proposed action] be a good idea or not?* They are asking for a justification or evaluation.

2. **What the answer provides** –  
   - The speaker begins with a deflection (“I appreciate you trying to drag me in the ‘08 race…”) and then shifts to a list of general concerns (high gasoline prices, food prices, housing, student loans).  
   - They note that “Congress can be helpful” and that “we’ll consider interesting ideas,” but they never spell out *why* the specific idea would be good or bad, nor do they evaluate the merits of agreeing with Senator McCain or Senator Obama.  
   - The response ends with a refusal to “jump right in the middle of a Presidential campaign,” effectively avoiding the substantive justification the question seeks.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – The answer does **not** explicitly state a reasoned judgment about whether the idea is good or bad.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – Some information is given (concerns about prices, mention of Congress, willingness to consider ideas), so it is not a total refusal to answer.  
   - **Ambivalent** – The response is **partial and incomplete**: it mentions related issues but does not flesh out the reasoning, leaving the core question unanswered. This matches the definition of an ambivalent answer—information is given in a vague, indirect, or deflecting way.

**Conclusion:** The interviewee’s reply is incomplete and indirect; it offers only general concerns without providing a clear justification for or against the proposed idea.

189,Is your administration to blame for letting North Korea get this far?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Democrats say that North Korea's reported test shows that your policy has been a failure, that you got bogged down in Iraq, where there were no weapons of mass destruction, while North Korea was moving ahead with a bomb. Is your administration to blame for letting North Korea get this far?","North Korea has been trying to acquire bombs and weapons for a long period of time, long before I came into office. And it's a threat that we've got to take seriously, and we do, of course.In 1994, the Government—our Government—entered into a bilateral arrangement with the North Koreans that worked to make sure that they don't have the capacity to develop a bomb, and North Korea agreed that there would be no program whatsoever toward the development of a weapon. And yet we came into office and discovered that they were developing a program, unbeknownst to the folks with whom they signed the agreement, the United States Government. And we confronted them with that evidence, and they admitted it was true and then left the agreement that they had signed with the U.S. Government.And my point—and then I—as I mentioned in my opening statement, we, once again, had North Korea at the table—this time with other parties at the table—and they agreed once again, through this statement as a result of the six-party talks, to verifiably show that they weren't advancing a nuclear weapons program. And they chose again to leave. And my point to you is that it's the intransigence of the North Korean leader that speaks volumes about the process. It is his unwillingness to choose a way forward for his country, a better way forward for his country. It is his decisions. And what's changed since then is that we now have other parties at the table who have made it clear to North Korea that they share the same goals of the United States, which is a nuclear weapons-free peninsula.Obviously, I'm listening very carefully to this debate. I can remember the time when it was said that the Bush administration goes it alone too often in the world, which I always thought was a bogus claim to begin with. And now all of a sudden, people are saying, the Bush administration ought to be going alone with North Korea. But it didn't work in the past, is my point. The strategy did not work. I learned a lesson from that and decided that the best way to convince Kim Jong Il to change his mind on a nuclear weapons program is to have others send the same message.And so in my phone calls that I recently made right after the test, I lamented the fact that he had tested to Hu Jintao and also lamented the fact that Hu Jintao had publicly asked him not to test. I talked to the South Korean President, and I said, It ought to be clear to us now that we must continue to work together to make it abundantly clear to the leader in North Korea that there's a better way forward. When he walks away from agreement, he's not just walking away from a table with the United States as the only participant, he's walking away from a table that others are sitting at.And my point to you is, in order to solve this diplomatically, the United States and our partners must have a strong diplomatic hand, and you have a better diplomatic hand with others sending the message than you do when you're alone. And so obviously, I made the decision that the bilateral negotiations wouldn't work, and the reason I made that decision is because they didn't. And we'll continue to work to come up with a diplomatic solution in North Korea.This is a serious issue. But I want to remind our fellow citizens that the North Korean issue was serious for years. And I also remind our citizens that we want to make sure that we solve this problem diplomatically. We've got to give every effort to do so. But in my discussions with our partners, I reassured them that the security agreements we have with them will be enforced if need be, and that's in particular to South Korea and Japan.Terry. I mean—you're not Terry; you're Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters].",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct judgment: *Is the administration to blame for allowing North Korea to advance its weapons program?* The expected answer would be a clear “yes,” “no,” or an explicit explanation of responsibility.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not give a straightforward yes/no verdict. Instead, the response:
   - Shifts focus to historical context (the 1994 agreement, North Korea’s long‑standing pursuit of weapons).
   - Emphasizes that the North Korean leader’s intransigence is the core problem.
   - Describes diplomatic efforts and the involvement of other parties.
   - Implicitly deflects blame onto the North Korean regime rather than accepting responsibility for the administration’s policy.

3. **Information provided** – The answer is **partial and indirect**. It touches on the issue but stops short of explicitly stating whether the administration is to blame. The response is more of a deflection and a recounting of background than a clear assessment of responsibility.

4. **Evasion or deflection?** – Yes. The speaker avoids a direct answer, choosing instead to explain circumstances and assign responsibility to another actor (the North Korean leader). This fits the definition of an *ambivalent* response: the information is given, but it is incomplete, implicit, and deflecting.

**Conclusion:** The response is **Ambivalent** – it addresses the topic but does so incompletely and indirectly, without a clear, explicit answer to the question.

190,Are people who are saying that we're moving forward to a full war wrong?,Q. ——people who are saying that we're moving forward to a full war are wrong?,"Deb, there's all kinds of speculation about what may be or not happening. What you're seeing on TV has started last February. It was an attempt by people to foment sectarian violence, and no— no question, it's dangerous there and violent. And the Maliki Government is going to have to deal with that violence, and we want to help them do so. It's in our interest that we succeed. A democracy in the heart of the Middle East is an important part of defeating the radicals and totalitarians that can't stand the emergence of a democracy.One of the interesting things that's taking place—and people have got to understand what's happening—is when you see a young democracy beginning to emerge in the Middle East, the extremists try to defeat its emergence.That's why you see violence in Lebanon. There's a young democracy in Lebanon run by Prime Minister Siniora. And that Government is being undermined, in my opinion, by extremist forces encouraged out of Syria and Iran. Why? Because a democracy will be a major defeat for those who articulate extremist points of view.We're trying to help get a democracy started in the Palestinian Territory. Prime Minister Olmert has reached out, at one point, to Prime Minister Abbas—or President Abbas. And you know what happens as soon as he does that? Extremists attack, because they can't stand the thought of a democracy. And the same thing is happening in Iraq. And it's in our mutual interest that we help this Government succeed.And no question, it's tough, Deb; no question about it. There's a lot of sectarian violence taking place, fomented, in my opinion, because of these attacks by Al Qaida, causing people to seek reprisal. And we will work with the Maliki Government to defeat these elements.By far, the vast majority of the people want to live in peace. Twelve million people voted. They said, We want to live under a Constitution which we approved. And our objective must be to help them realize their dreams. This is the—this is an important part of an ideological struggle that is taking place here in the beginning of the 21st century. And the interesting contribution that a country like Estonia is making is that people shouldn't have to live under tyranny—We just did that; we don't like it. They understand that democracies yield peace. This President is a strong advocate for democracies because he understands what it means to live under subjugation, and he understands the hope that democracy brings to regions of the world.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct judgment: *Are the people who claim we are moving toward a full war wrong?* The expected answer would be a clear “Yes, they are wrong” or “No, they are not wrong,” or at least an explicit statement taking a position on that claim.

2. **What the answer does** – The interviewee launches into a broad discussion about speculation, violence, democracy, and the need to help a government succeed. The response:
   - Mentions “all kinds of speculation” and that “it’s dangerous there and violent.”
   - Talks about helping a government, democracy, extremists, and the importance of democratic emergence.
   - Ends with a general statement about the majority wanting peace and the role of democracy.
   - **Never explicitly says** whether the people warning of a full war are right or wrong. Instead, it provides context and deflects from a direct yes/no answer.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – Not satisfied; the answer does not give a straightforward affirmation or denial of the claim.

191, Do you trust or believe that the opposition will accept your invitation for a dialog?,"Q. Good afternoon. This question is to the three leaders. The stock exchange mar-kets—the stock markets have gone through a severe crisis in recent weeks. How close are we to a stock exchange crash, and what measures have you taken so that it does not affect the real economy?So when you will be presenting your first report, there's an opposition party that wants to prevent this—what is the outlook in your view? What's the outlook? And do you trust—do you believe that the opposition will accept your invitation for a dialog?","Well, to answer the first question, there's the financial problem, which is quite delicate in several markets. What I can tell you in relation to the case of Mexico, fortunately, our financial system has been solid enough to resist these critical times. I know that many central banks in several parts of the world, the European Union, the Federal Reserve in the U.S., and other central banks, have applied considerable resources in order to bring liquidity to their financial and banking systems.Now, fortunately, in the case of Mexico, this has not been necessary. The financial system and the banking system is very solid. It took us a lot of work, a lot of money to have such a solid system that would resist situations like this, but fortunately, it has not required the support of liquidity from the Central Bank of Mexico.Currently, the Mexican Stock Exchange has adjusted fixed income values. This is the case throughout the world. However, the Mexican Stock Exchange was one of the five that actually had an increase in its value throughout the world last year, over 50 percent. And obviously, the reduction that we're seeing is somehow or another a form of a correction, which will actually improve the health of the financial markets in Mexico.Could it have an impact in the real economy? Well, that depends on the scope of the situation, how it affects the markets, particularly the North American markets, which affects us most. My belief is that the situation is beginning to stabilize. And it will depend on the impact that it might have on the growth of the U.S., which, as you know, Mexico depends on this growth, on the U.S. growth.Now, in relation to the second subject, the second issue, I have invited legislators. I'm a democrat that believes in the basic ideas and that believes in constructing dialog, and this is what I'm seeking in Congress, constructive dialog. Unfortunately, I still haven't received a positive answer from this—in relation to this invitation, but I believe, I trust that in the future, there will be greater willingness to talk about issues of concern for all Mexicans.I know it's another system, Canada is, but Prime Minister Harper has to talk to his Parliament just about every day, every week. And I think—I would say that we would—I would very much like to have an institutional way in Mexico so that we're able to work and to talk about what we agree with and what we don't agree with in our country. I'll be willing to talk to anybody that wants to talk to me, particularly within Congress.Now, in relation to the attitude of the PRD or other members of that party, I respect them, and of course, I appeal to the sense of responsibility towards the country. And I hope that maturity will prevail and common sense too. So the only thing that will be lost with this is that anybody that breaks the basic laws of our institutional life—let's say that citizens know very well and recognize the maturity and the responsibility of political parties, and the people of our country are able to punish these attitudes too. Our monetary and financial systems that monitor it are following it closely. But naturally, there are certain differences in their assets and liabilities, and some of the major corporations will have drops in their stocks. That is the normal course. But I can assure you that the capital situation of our major corporations, our financial institutions, of our individual persons are very strong.[.]Our economic and financial institutions that are responsible for watching these markets are monitoring them closely. At the same time, just to remind people, it's normal for the price of assets of various securities or companies or whatever to go up and down in the marketplace. It's not unusual. I can assure you that the position of Canadian financial sector, in particular our banks, Canadian companies in general, and the household sector, our capital positions are very strong. The fundamentals of the U.S. economy are strong. Inflation is down; interest rates are low; the employment picture is strong; exports are up. We grew at over 3 percent in the second quarter. The fundamental question is, is there enough liquidity in our system as people readjust risk? And the answer is, yes, there is.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct answer to the question: *“Do you trust or believe that the opposition will accept your invitation for a dialog?”*  
   The expected response is a clear indication of the speaker’s trust/ belief (yes, no, uncertain, etc.).

2. **What the answer contains** – The interviewee says:  
   - “Unfortunately, I still haven’t received a positive answer …” – indicating they have not yet gotten a confirmed acceptance.  
   - “…but I **believe**, I **trust** that in the future, there will be greater willingness to talk …” – explicitly stating that they **trust** the opposition will eventually accept the invitation.

3. **Is the information explicitly stated?** – Yes. The speaker directly uses the words “I trust” and “I believe” to convey their attitude toward the opposition’s acceptance. This is an explicit statement of trust, even though it is qualified with “in the future” and “greater willingness.”

4. **Is the answer evasive, incomplete, or non‑responsive?** – No. The response does not dodge the question; it directly addresses it by giving a clear stance (“I trust …”). It may add context, but it does not avoid answering.

5. **Classification decision** – Because the interviewee **explicitly states** their trust/belief regarding the opposition’s acceptance, the response fits the **Clear Reply** category.

So they say they haven\'t received a positive answer, but they trust that there will be greater willingness. That\'s a partial answer: they express trust that opposition will accept, but also note they haven\'t received a positive answer. It\'s somewhat ambiguous, but they do state trust. It\'s not a clear yes/no; it\'s more of a hopeful statement. It\'s somewhat incomplete, but they do give a stance: they trust that there will be greater willingness. That\'s an explicit statement of trust, albeit conditional. It\'s not a clear definitive answer; it\'s more of a hopeful statement. It\'s not a full answer but provides some info. According to categories: Clear Reply = explicitly stated info in requested form. Here they do explicitly state ""I trust that ... there will be greater willingness"". That\'s an explicit statement of trust. However the question asks ""Do you trust or believe that the opposition will accept your invitation for a dialog?"" The answer: ""I trust that ... there will be greater willingness"". That\'s a clear statement of trust, albeit conditional. It\'s not evasive; it\'s a direct answer albeit with nuance. It\'s not incomplete? It does answer but also adds context. It\'s not a deflection? It addresses the question directly. It\'s not ambiguous? It says they trust that there will be greater willingness, which implies belief that opposition will accept. So it\'s a clear reply?

1. **What the question asks**  
   - The interviewer wants a direct assessment of whether the speaker perceives a *shift* in overall public/political support for the Iraq war and how that might affect his own strategy.

2. **How the answer addresses the question**  
   - The speaker talks about “adjust[ing]” and being “flexible,” and mentions that “if the plan isn’t working, adjust.”  
   - He also refers to trusting generals and that “you can’t fight a war from Washington.”  
   - However, he never explicitly states **whether** he feels there is a shift in support, nor does he give a clear judgment about the current level of support. The response is vague and stays at the level of general principle (“be flexible,” “adjust”) rather than answering the specific query.

3. **Information type**  
   - The answer provides **partial, implicit** information: it hints at the idea of adjusting to changing circumstances, but it does **not** directly answer the question about perceiving a shift in support.  
   - It is therefore not a full, explicit reply.

4. **Evasion / deflection**  
   - The response sidesteps the precise question by discussing broader themes (flexibility, trusting generals) instead of giving a clear yes/no or descriptive answer about a shift in support.

5. **Classification decision**  
   - Because the answer is **incomplete and indirect**, offering only a general, somewhat related statement rather than a clear answer, it fits the definition of an **Ambivalent** response.

Congress needs to get them reformed, get them streamlined, get them focused, and then I will consider other options.Baker.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step reasoning**

1. **What the question asks:**  
   The interviewer wants a direct answer to a policy question: *Should Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac be allowed to buy mortgages beyond their current limits or take on any additional role to help revive mortgage finance?* The expected response would be a clear yes/no or a clear statement of position.

2. **What the answer provides:**  
   - The interviewee talks about a “robust reform package,” regulatory oversight, and the need for Congress to reform and streamline the agencies.  
   - The answer ends with “then I will consider other options,” which is a vague, future‑oriented statement.  
   - No explicit yes or no is given; the core question about expanding the agencies’ authority is left unanswered.

3. **Evaluation against the categories:**  
   - **Clear Reply:** The answer does **not** explicitly state a position, so it fails this category.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply:** The interviewee does address the topic (reform, oversight, future options), so it is not a complete non‑reply due to ignorance or refusal.  
   - **Ambivalent:** The response is **incomplete** and **deflective**—it offers only general remarks about reform and defers a decision, without directly answering the specific question.

**Conclusion:** The response is an incomplete, indirect answer that dodges the precise query, fitting the **Ambivalent** category.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct assessment of the *importance* of a *competitive (i.e., weaker) dollar* for sustaining strong and growing U.S. exports.

2. **What the answer provides** –  
   - The interviewee talks about a “strong dollar policy” and that “the value of the dollar will be reflected in the ability for our economy to grow.”  
   - The response is vague, does not explicitly state how (or whether) a competitive dollar is important for exports, and instead repeats a generic endorsement of a strong dollar.

197,\n2. Do you believe that the biggest drag on the Republican Party is the situation in Iraq?,"Q. If so, why? And do you believe that the biggest drag on the Republican Party is the situation in Iraq?","I believe that the situation in Iraq is, no question, tough on the American psyche, like I said, I think, at this very spot last time I faced the press corps. And it's serious business. Look, the American people want to know, can we win— that's what they want to know—and do we have a plan to win. There are some who say, Get out. It's not worth it. And those are some of the voices, by the way, in the Democrat Party. Certainly not all Democrats, but some of the loud voices in the party say, Get out.And so no question this is an issue, but so is the economy. And I believe there'll be—I still stand by my prediction, we'll have a Republican Speaker and a Republican leader of the Senate. And the reason I say that is because I believe the two biggest issues in this campaign are, one, the economy. And the economy is growing. The national unemployment rate is 4.6 percent. We've just discovered, as the result of analyzing new data, that we added 6.6 million new jobs since August of 2003. Gas prices are down. Tax cuts are working.And there's a difference of opinion in the campaign about taxes, and we will keep them low. Matter of fact, I would like to keep the—make the tax cuts we pass permanent. And the Democrats will raise taxes. Now, I know they say only on rich people, but that's—in my judgment, having been around here long enough to know, it's just code word. They're going to raise them on whoever they can raise them on.And then on security, the American people know that our biggest job is to protect this country from further attack, and—because they know there's an enemy that still plots and plans. And there is; there is. Recently we learned that, when British intelligence and U.S. intelligence—with our help—broke up a plot to get on airplanes and blow them up, the planes that were going to fly from Great Britain to here. And they want to know—they, the people—want to know what are we doing to protect them.There have been some votes on the floor of the Senate and the House that make it abundantly clear, we just have a different view of the world. The vast majority of Democrats voted against a program that would enable us to interrogate high-value detainees. That was the vote. It's wide open for everybody to see: Should a CIA program go forward or not go forward? The vast majority of Democrats in the House voted against a program that would have institutionalized the capacity for this Government to listen to Al Qaida phone calls or Al Qaida affiliate phone calls coming from outside the country to inside the country.It's very important for our fellow citizens to recognize that I don't question anybody's patriotism, but I do question a strategy that says, we can't give those on the frontline of fighting terror the tools necessary to fight terror. I believe that in order to defend America, we must take a threat seriously and defeat an enemy overseas so we don't have to face them here. I don't believe we can wait to respond after attack has occurred.And so I think these are the two biggest issues, Bret. And Iraq is a part of the war on terror. Now, I recognize Democrats say that's not the case, and what I say to the American people when I am out there is, all you've got to do is listen to what Usama bin Laden says. Don't believe me that it's a part of the war on terror; listen to the enemy, or listen to Mr. Zawahiri, the number two of Al Qaida, both of whom made it clear that Iraq is central in their plans. And I firmly believe that American people understand that this is different from other war because in this war, if we were to leave early before the job is done, the enemy will follow us here.And so I believe, Bret, that we'll maintain control because we're on the right side of the economic issue and the security issue.Let's see. Yes, sir, Mr. NPR [Don Gonyea, National Public Radio]. Welcome to the front row. Yes, it's good.Democratic Party/",Ambivalent,"
**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct assessment: *Is the situation in Iraq the biggest drag on the Republican Party?* The expected answer would be a clear yes/no or a concise statement of the interviewee’s belief on that specific point.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does mention that “the situation in Iraq is… tough” and that it is “serious business,” but the response quickly moves away from evaluating whether Iraq is *the* biggest drag. Instead, the speaker pivots to a broader set of topics (the economy, tax cuts, security, Democratic positions, etc.) and never returns to the original query.

3. **Information provided** – The answer is **partial and indirect**. It offers related commentary (Iraq is tough, there are voices calling to “get out,” etc.) but does **not** state a belief about whether Iraq is the *biggest* drag on the party. The core question remains unanswered.

4. **Nature of the response** – Because the reply is vague, deflects, and fails to give a clear answer to the specific question, it fits the definition of an **Ambivalent** response: the information is given in an incomplete, indirect, and somewhat evasive manner.

199,Do you agree with the Prime Minister's supporters that he led the way on the issue?,"Q. Mr. President, you've talked about the need for robust action on your country's deficit and debt positions. Do you agree with the Prime Minister's supporters that he led the way on the issue, or do you feel that, in fact, he has traveled too far and too fast?And could I just ask you both, as a sidebar, this time last year, we talked about the case of computer hacker Gary McKinnon, on which the Prime Minister has expressed very clear views. You said you would work together to find a solution. So have you found one?","Well, on your second question, Mr. McKinnon, we have proceeded through all the processes required under our extradition agreements. It is now in the hands of the British legal system. We have confidence in the British legal system coming to a just conclusion. And so we await resolution and will be respectful of that process.With respect to how we deal with debt and deficits, I said 2 years ago, the first time I came here, in April of 2009, the first G-20 summit that I attended, that each country is different and each country is going to have to make a range of decisions about how to--at that time--dig our way out of the worst recession that we'd experienced since the 1930s, at the same time that we put our countries on a path of sustainable growth that ultimately results in jobs and prosperity for our people and a growing middle class across the board.And we've succeeded in the first part, which is to yank the world economy out of recession, and that was in large part due to concerted action between the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries.Now we've got that other challenge, which is how do we sustain growth in a way that's responsible and responsive to the needs of our people. That requires us to continue to make investments in education, science, technology, infrastructure, things that help our economies grow. But it also means governments that live within their means.And obviously, the nature and role of the public sector in the United Kingdom is different than it has been in the United States. The pressures that each country are under from world capital markets are different. The nature of the debt and deficits are different. And as a consequence, the sequencing or pace may end up being different.But the one thing that I'm absolutely clear about is David and I want to arrive at the same point, a point in which we're making sure that our governments are doing what they need to do to ensure broad-based prosperity, but doing so in a responsible way that doesn't mortgage our futures and leave a mountain of debt to future generations.And the other point I think David and I would agree on is that this is going to be a constant process of trying some things, making adjustments. There are going to be opportunities for us to make investments. There are going to be other areas where we think those were good ideas at the time, programs that were started with the best of intentions, and it turns out they're not working as well as they should. If a program is not working well, we should get rid of it and put that money into programs that are working well. It means that we've got to make sure that we take a balanced approach and that there's a mix of cuts, but also thinking about how do we generate revenue so that there's a match between money going out and money coming in.And each country is going to have to go through what is a difficult and painful process. What I'm confident about is that we're going to be able to come out of this stronger than we were before. And I think that both the people of the United Kingdom and the people of the United States want to see a government that's reflective of their values, the fact that they take their responsibilities seriously, they pay their bills, they make sure that their families are cared for, they make sacrifices where necessary in order to ensure that their children and their grandchildren are succeeding. And they want those same values reflected in their government, and I think that both our countries are going to be able to achieve that. Thank you. First of all, in the case of Gary McKinnon, I mean, I understand the widespread concern about this case, and it's not so much about the alleged offense, which everyone knows is a very serious offense; it's about the issue of the individual and the way they're treated and the operation of the legal system and, as the President said, making sure that legal system operates properly and carefully.The case is currently in front of the Home Secretary, who has to consider reports about Gary's health and his well-being, and it's right that she does that in a proper and effectively quasi-judicial way.I totally understand the anguish of his mother and his family about this issue. We must follow the proper processes and make sure this case is dealt with in the proper way. And I'm sure that that is the case.On the issue of deficit reduction, I mean, I remember when we also spoke about this at the G-20, but even before that, when you first came here when you were running as a candidate. And I completely agree with Barack that each country is different and has different circumstances. I mean, Britain does not have a reserve currency. We're not in the same position as the U.S. with the dollar. And I think it was necessary for us to set out on the path of deficit reduction without delay after the election.And I would argue the proof of that for the U.K. has been what has happened in capital markets. And as the President just said, capital markets treat different countries differently. Well, in the European context, what you've seen since the election is actually market interest rates in the U.K., bond yields effectively come down. Whereas you look at what's happened in Greece or in Portugal or other European countries, you've often seen those bond rates increase. That, in my view, is the risk we would have run if we had not set out on the path of deficit reduction.But each country is different, but when I look across now and see what the U.S. and the U.K. are currently contemplating for the future, it's actually a relatively similar program in terms of trying to get on top of our deficits and make sure that debt is falling as a share of GDP. Because as the President said, we, in the end, share a very similar set of values about not wanting to load responsibility for these debts on our children and not wanting to shirk our own responsibilities for straightening out our own public finances.So, as he said, we may take slightly different paths, but we want to end up in the same place. It's an extremely difficult thing to have to do--dealing with your public finances, getting on top of your deficit--but it's absolutely essential. And we've talked a lot today about national security. In the end, there's no national security unless you have economic security. And that's an argument that we have to make and win every day here in the United Kingdom. Christi Parsons [Chicago Tribune], last question.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks**  
   - The interviewer wants a direct judgment: *Does the speaker agree with the Prime Minister’s supporters that the Prime Minister “led the way” on the issue of fiscal consolidation/debt management?*  
   - This is a yes/no or explanatory answer about the Prime Minister’s role/leadership.

2. **What the answer actually does**  
   - The response talks about extradition procedures, the Gary McKinnon case, and a broad discussion of debt, deficits, and fiscal policy.  
   - It mentions “David and I want to arrive at the same point” and that both want “broad‑based prosperity” responsibly, but it never states whether the speaker **agrees** that the Prime Minister “led the way.”  
   - The answer sidesteps the specific query, offering only general statements about fiscal policy and cooperation, without addressing the leadership claim.

3. **Does the answer give the requested information?**  
   - **No.** The core request—an explicit stance on whether the Prime Minister led the way—is not answered.  
   - The response is **partial and indirect**; it provides related background but does not answer the question.

4. **Which classification fits?**  
   - **Clear Reply** – not applicable; the answer does not explicitly state agreement or disagreement.

Has it become better, or has it become worse? We always want to have more of a good thing, and we shouldn't forget that the—as we say, the better is the worst enemy of the good.Let us remember the world on the brink of a nuclear disaster during the Caribbean crisis, and now let us look at the U.S.Russia relationship today. A crisis like the Cuban crisis would not be possible now; it would be unthinkable. I agree with George when he said that Russia and the United States no longer consider each other as enemies. At a minimum, they look at each other as partners, and I believe this is very important.Of course, a lot of outstanding issues remain. It is true that we do have disagreements on some sensitive areas of our cooperation, but at the same time, we do have enough strength to search for solutions. And as our meeting today has shown, we are capable of achieving positive re-sults—that is, on the whole—in counterterrorism, in fighting proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missile technology, of fighting the drug threat. All of these create a reliable platform for cooperation, not only between Russia and the United States but a platform that contributes to ensuring international security.If we mention on top of that our economic cooperation, we can state that in the past 8 years, we have been able to improve the relations between our two countries and in the world as a whole. Yes, I agree with that answer. And secondly, I spent—I told President-elect that I would see him in Japan at the G-8, and that's the only scheduling matters that we discussed. And I'm going to finish out my term—my time with Vladimir, and then I'll turn my attention to the President when he gets to be the President.

Secondly, I have said that if the international force would like some help with logistics and command and control, we'd be willing to offer logistics and command and control. There are some places where—it's like Darfur; people say to me, Why don't you commit U.S. troops to Darfur as part of an international peacekeeping? And the answer there is that those troops would be—would create a sensation around the world that may not enable us to achieve our objective. And so when we commit troops, we commit troops for a specific reason, with the intent of achieving an objective. And I think command and control and logistical support is probably the best—is the best use of U.S. forces.Mike Fletcher [Washington Post].",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking for a direct explanation: *“Is it because the military is already overtasked?”* They want a yes/no or a clear statement about whether the military’s current workload is the reason for not including U.S. troops.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The respondent does not answer the question head‑on. Instead, they:
   - Bring up historical U.S. troop presence in Lebanon.
   - Offer that the U.S. could provide logistics and command‑and‑control support.
   - Use a Darfur analogy to discuss when troops are (or are not) deployed.
   - Conclude with a general statement about committing troops “for a specific reason, with the intent of achieving an objective.”

   The response never says “No, it’s not because the military is overtasked,” nor does it explain that the military’s workload is (or is not) the factor. It sidesteps the specific query and instead discusses unrelated points.

3. **Information type** – The answer is **partial and indirect**. It provides related context but does not give the explicit answer the question demands. It is therefore incomplete with respect to the requested information.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The response deflects from the specific premise (“overtasked military”) and shifts to a broader discussion of troop commitments and objectives.

**Conclusion:** The answer does not directly answer the question; it offers only a vague, indirect, and partially relevant reply, fitting the definition of an *ambivalent* response.

When President Musharraf visits Afghanistan on the 9th of August to inaugurate the joint Pakistan-Afghanistan convention, or jirga, together with me, we will be discussing further improvements and relations between the two countries. The two countries are neighbors; they've been having extensive relationships with each other. We will be discussing improvement of those relations, on all aspects of them.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct answer to a hypothetical: *Would the speaker wait for Musharraf’s permission to launch a U.S. raid on Al Qaida leaders, even if that meant missing the chance to capture them?* It also asks whether any prior arrangement with Musharraf exists.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response talks generally about:
   - Confidence in actionable intelligence,
   - Ongoing communication with the Pakistani government,
   - A shared concern about foreign fighters,
   - Upcoming talks between President Musharraf and President Karzai,
   - Improving bilateral relations and cooperation against terrorism.

   It never states whether the speaker would wait for permission, nor does it confirm or deny any pre‑existing deal. The answer is vague, indirect, and shifts focus to broader cooperation rather than answering the specific conditional question.

3. **Information type** – The core of the question is left unanswered; only peripheral, general statements are provided. The response is therefore incomplete with respect to the requested information.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker deflects the precise hypothetical by discussing broader policy context instead of giving a clear yes/no or conditional answer.

**Conclusion:** The answer does not give a clear, explicit reply; it is partial and indirect, fitting the definition of an *Ambivalent* response.

203,Are we headed toward a military action in North Korea?,"Q. Mr. President, a lot of people here in Chicago tell us that they see an incongruity in your foreign policy. We're involved in a shooting war in Iraq; yet we have a leader in North Korea who has announced his affection for nuclear weapons and no hesitation to use them against the United States. Is your policy consistent between the way you have dealt with Iraq, the way you have dealt with North Korea? And if so, are we headed toward a military action in North Korea? And if so, can this Nation sustain military action on three fronts: Iraq, Afghanistan, and North Korea?","I have always said that it's important for an American President to exhaust all diplomatic avenues before the use of force. Committing our troops into harm's way is a difficult decision. It's the toughest decision a President will ever make. And I fully understand the consequences of doing so.All diplomatic options were exhausted, as far as I was concerned, with Saddam Hussein. Remember that the U.N. Security Council resolution that we passed when I was the President was 1 of 16, I think— 16, 17? Give me a hand here. More than 15. [] Resolution after resolution after resolution saying the same thing, and he ignored them. And we tried diplomacy. We went to the U.N. Security Council— 15-to-nothing vote that said, Disarm, disclose, or face serious consequences.I happen to believe that when you say something, you better mean it. And so when we signed on to that resolution that said, disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences, I meant what we said. That's one way you keep the peace: You speak clearly, and you mean what you say.And so the choice was Saddam Hussein's choice. He could have not fooled the inspectors. He could have welcomed the world in. He could have told us what was going on. But he didn't, and so we moved.And we're in the diplomatic process now with ; that's what you're seeing happening. Remember—remember, we put a coalition together at the United Nations that said, Disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences. It was 15 to nothing. It wasn't a U.S. 1 to 14. It was 15 to nothing; other nations stood up and said the same thing we said.So we're now working the diplomacy, and you're watching the diplomacy work, not only in but in Iran. It's kind of painful, in a way, for some to watch because it takes a while to get people on the same page. Everybody—not everybody thinks the exact same way we think. There are different—words mean different things to different people, and the diplomatic processes can be slow and cumbersome. That's why this is probably the fourth day in a row I've been asked about . It's slow and cumbersome. Things just don't happen overnight.But what you're watching is a diplomatic response to a person who, since 1994, has said they're—not going to have a weapon.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a clear answer to the specific query: *“Are we headed toward a military action in North Korea?”*  
   The expected response would be a direct statement (yes, no, or “we’re not sure”) about the likelihood of imminent military action.

2. **What the answer provides** – The interviewee launches into a broad discussion of:
   - The importance of exhausting diplomatic options before using force.  
   - Past actions regarding Iraq and U.N. resolutions.  
   - General observations about diplomacy being “slow and cumbersome.”  
   - No explicit statement about whether the United States is moving toward military action against North Korea.

3. **Does the answer give the requested information?** – No. It never says “yes, we are headed toward military action” or “no, we are not.” It only talks about diplomatic processes and past precedent, leaving the core question unanswered.

4. **Nature of the omission** – The omission is not due to ignorance or a request for clarification; the speaker chooses to deflect and provide a generic discourse instead of answering directly. This is a classic case of **dodging/deflection**, offering only partial, implicit commentary rather than the explicit answer sought.

5. **Classification decision** – Because the response is **incomplete and indirect**—it touches on related themes but fails to give a clear, explicit answer—it fits the **Ambivalent** category: the information is given in an incomplete, partial, and deflecting manner.

**Classification:** **Ambivalent**","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to the specific question: ""Are we headed toward a military action in North Korea?""

204,Do you think that the statement made by the Republican leader in the House is the right tone to set for the upcoming campaign?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd also like to ask an election-related question. The Republican leader in the House this week said that Democrats—he wonders if they are more interested in protecting the terrorists than protecting the American people. Do you agree with him, sir? And do you think that's the right tone to set for this upcoming campaign, or do you think he owes somebody an apology?","I wouldn't have exactly put it that way. But I do believe there's a difference of attitude. I mean, take the PATRIOT Act, for example—an interesting debate that took place, not once, but twice, and the second time around there was a lot of concern about whether or not the PATRIOT Act was necessary to protect the country. There's no doubt in my mind we needed to make sure the PATRIOT Act was renewed to tear down walls that exist so that intelligence people could serve— could share information with criminal people. It wasn't the case, Mark, before 9/11.In other words, if somebody had some intelligence that they thought was necessary to protect the people, they couldn't share that with somebody who's job it was to rout people out of society to prevent them from attacking. It just made no sense. And so there was a healthy debate, and we finally got the PATRIOT Act extended after it was passed right after 9/11. To me, it was an indication of just a difference of approach.No one should ever question the patriotism of somebody who—let me just start over. I don't question the patriotism of somebody who doesn't agree with me; I just don't. And I think it's unwise to do that. I don't think that's what leaders do. I do think that—I think that there is a difference of opinion here in Washington about tools necessary to protect the country—the terrorist surveillance program—or what did you call it, Hutcheson? Yes, the illegal eavesdropping program is what you wanted to call it—[]—IEP as opposed to TSP. [] There's just a difference of opinion about what we need to do to protect our country, Mark. I'm confident the leader, you know, meant nothing personal. I know that he shares my concern that we pass good legislation to get something done.Ken.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct judgment on whether the Republican leader’s statement is “the right tone to set for the upcoming campaign.” The expected answer would be a clear yes/no or an explicit evaluation of the tone.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not give a direct assessment of the tone. Instead, they:
   - Rephrase the question (“I wouldn’t have exactly put it that way”).
   - Shift the discussion to a historical debate about the PATRIOT Act.
   - Talk about differences of approach, intelligence sharing, and “difference of opinion.”
   - Conclude with a general statement that “leaders don’t question the patriotism of somebody who doesn’t agree with me” and that “he shares my concern… meant nothing personal.”

   The response never states whether the tone is appropriate or not; it only offers vague, indirect commentary.

3. **Information type** – The answer is **partial and implicit**. It touches on the underlying attitude but does not provide the explicit evaluation the question requests. It is neither a full refusal nor a complete non‑reply; it supplies some related commentary but leaves the core question unanswered.

4. **Evasion check** – The response deflects and provides a broader context rather than a straightforward judgment, which fits the definition of an **ambivalent** answer (incomplete, indirect, and somewhat dodging the specific request).

205,Government shutdown threat,"Q. Thank you, sir. You've spoken extensively about the debt ceiling debate, but some Republicans have further said that they're willing to allow a Government shutdown to take place rather than put off deep spending cuts. Are you prepared to allow the Government to grind to a halt if you disagree with the spending cut proposals they put forth? And who do you think the American people would blame if that came to pass?","Well, ultimately, Congress makes the decisions about whether or not we spend money and whether or not we keep this Government open. And if the Republicans in Congress have made a decision that they want to shut down the Government in order to get their way, then they have the votes at least in the House of Representatives, probably, to do that.I think that would be a mistake. I think it would be profoundly damaging to our economy. I think it would actually add to our deficit because it will impede growth. I think it's shortsighted. But they're elected representatives, and folks put them into those positions, and they're going to have to make a decision about that. And I don'tI suspect that the American people would blame all of Washington for not being able to get its act together.But the larger issue here has to do with, well, what is it that we're trying to accomplish. Are we trying to reduce the deficit? Because if we're trying to reduce the deficit, then we can shape a bipartisan plan to reduce the deficit. I mean, is that really our objective? Our concern is that we're spending more than we take in, and if that's the case, then there's a way of balancing that out so that we take in more money, increasing revenue, and we reduce spending. And there's a recipe for getting that done.And in the conversations that I had with Speaker Boehner before the end of the year, we came pretty close; I mean, a few hundred billion dollars separating us when stretched out over a 10-year period, that's not a lot.But it seems as if what's motivating and propelling at this point some of the House Republicans is more than simply deficit reduction. They have a particular vision about what Government should and should not do. So they are suspicious about Government's commitments, for example, to make sure that seniors have decent health care as they get older. They have suspicions about Social Security. They have suspicions about whether Government should make sure that kids in poverty are getting enough to eat or whether we should be spending money on medical research. So they've got a particular view of what Government should do and should be.And that view was rejected by the American people when it was debated during the Presidential campaign. I think every poll that's out there indicates that the American people actually think our commitment to Medicare or to education is really important, and that's something that we should look at as a last resort in terms of reducing the deficit, and it makes a lot more sense for us to close, for example, corporate loopholes before we go to putting a bigger burden on students or seniors.But if the House Republicans disagree with that and they want to shut down the Government to see if they can get their way on it, that's their prerogative. That's how the system is set up. It will damage our economy.The Government is a big part of this economy, and it's interesting that a lot of times, you have people who recognize that when it comes to defense spending; some of the same folks who say we've got to cut spending or complain that Government jobs don't do anything, when it comes to that defense contractor in their district, they think, wow, this is a pretty important part of the economy in my district, and we shouldn't stop spending on that. Let's just make sure we're not spending on those other folks.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct answer to two linked queries:  
   a) Whether the interviewee would allow a government shutdown if they disagreed with spending‑cut proposals, and  
   b) Who would be blamed if such a shutdown occurred.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee explicitly discusses the possibility of a shutdown:  
   - They note that “Congress makes the decisions… if the Republicans in Congress have made a decision that they want to shut down the Government… they have the votes… to do that.”  
   - They state that such an action “would be a mistake” and “profoundly damaging.”  
   - They answer the blame question directly: “I think the American people would blame all of Washington for not being able to get its act together.”  

   The response therefore provides a clear, explicit stance on both parts of the question.

3. **Information type** – The requested information (the interviewee’s preparedness and the anticipated blame) is fully stated, not vague or partial. The answer does not dodge or deflect; it gives a concrete position.

Remember, in Germany, the first thing I said was—or one of the first things I said—I think I said this—help me out here, if I didn't—— I think you did. The President. ——was we want the Siniora Government to survive and to be strengthened. The linchpin of the policy is to support democracies. And so the strategy at the U.N., the diplomatic strategy is to support that notion because a democracy in Lebanon will not only help that nation address its long-term issues—such as rebuilding and providing a hopeful life—but a democracy on Israel's northern border will stabilize—help stabilize the region. We are committed to a democracy in the Palestinian Territory. President Abbas, in his conversations with Condi, talked about moving forward with democracy. There are people who can't stand the thought of a society based upon universal liberty from emerging. And that in itself ought to be a warning signal to those of us who care deeply for peace, that people would be willing to kill innocent citizens in order to stop the advance of liberty.Now, I've talked a lot about the universal appeal of liberty, and I readily concede some people aren't willing to—some say, well, you know, liberty may not be universal in this sense—America imposes its will. We don't impose liberty; liberty is universal.It's one of the interesting debates of the 21st century, I think, that some would be willing to say it's okay for people not to live in a free society. It's not okay for us. If you love peace, in order to achieve peace, you must help people realize that which is universal, and that is freedom.She asked you a question. Our point of contact for the Lebanese Government is obviously Prime Minister Siniora. As you know, I've also spoken to Speaker Berri on a couple of occasions.I understand how emotional this is for the Lebanese. They've been through a very difficult war. It's emotional for Israel as well. They're in the midst of a difficult war.Let me just say that in terms of what the end state will look like here, I don't think there is any disagreement that the right solution is the one that the President referred to. It's the Lebanese and the Lebanese Armed Forces able to secure their territory. And the international help is so that Lebanon can secure its territory. And I don't believe anybody anticipates that there should be foreign forces on Lebanese soil as a result of what has happened here.And so I think there is room on this issue to work on this issue, because everybody has the same vision—that it's the Lebanese Army, with support from an international force, that can actually prevent that vacuum from obtaining again in the south, so that we're not right back here 3 or 4 or 5 months from now, in the same situation.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a clear answer to whether Secretary Rice will contact Speaker Berri again, i.e., a direct yes/no or explicit statement about future outreach.

2. **What the answer provides** – The response mentions that the speaker has spoken to Berri on a couple of occasions and that the point of contact for the Lebanese Government is Prime Minister Siniora. It does **not** state whether Rice will reach out to Berri in the future; it merely notes past contact and shifts to broader talking points.

3. **Nature of the response** – The answer is vague, indirect, and does not give the requested explicit information. It partially addresses the topic (past interaction) but leaves the core question unanswered, effectively deflecting rather than providing a clear reply.

4. **Classification decision** – Because the information is given in an incomplete, implicit, and somewhat evasive manner—neither a straightforward “yes” nor a clear refusal—it fits the **Ambivalent** category.

209,Will the U.N. Security Council move quickly on sanctions if Iran does not stop or suspend its enrichment program?,"Q. Mr. President, as you mentioned, we're just 10 days from the U.N. Security Council deadline on Iran. Judging by the public comments from the Iranians, it appears, at least, highly unlikely that they're going to stop or suspend their enrichment program. Are you confident that the U.N. Security Council will move quickly on sanctions if Iran thumbs its nose at the world again?","I certainly hope so. In order for the U.N. to be effective, there must be consequences if people thumb their nose at the United Nations Security Council. And we will work with people in the Security Council to achieve that objective, and the objective is that there's got to be a consequence for them basically ignoring what the Security Council has suggested through resolution.",Ambivalent,"
**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks:**  
   The interviewer wants a direct assessment of whether the U.N. Security Council will act quickly with sanctions if Iran continues its enrichment program.

2. **How the answer responds:**  
   - The interviewee says, “I certainly hope so,” which signals a hopeful stance but does **not** give a definitive yes or no.  
   - The response then shifts to a broader statement about the need for consequences and that “we will work with people in the Security Council to achieve that objective.”  
   - This answer is **general**, **conditional**, and **deflects** the specific yes/no query by framing the issue in terms of hope and intention rather than a concrete prediction.

3. **Evaluation against the categories:**  
   - **Clear Reply:** The answer does **not** explicitly state “Yes, the Security Council will move quickly” (or a clear “No”).  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply:** The interviewee does address the topic; they do not simply refuse to answer or claim ignorance.  
   - **Ambivalent:** The response provides a **partial, incomplete, and somewhat evasive** answer—it hints at a desired outcome but stops short of a definitive judgment, making it an incomplete answer to the specific question.

**Conclusion:** The response is best classified as **Ambivalent**.

210,What kind of cooperation do you think is possible between Japan and the United States to resolve the missile issue related to the North Koreans launching Taepodong-2?,"Q. On North Korea, I'd like to ask a question of both of you, Prime Minister and President. On North Korea, I understand you spent a lot of time to exchange views. It is said that the North Koreans are preparing to launch Taepodong-2. To resolve this missile issue, what kind of cooperation do you think is possible between Japan and the United States? And also, did you discuss possibly referring the matter to the U.N. Security Council?On the abduction issue and human rights issue, I understand, Mr. President, you've shown deep concern for the resolution of the abduction issue. What sort of cooperation do you think is possible between the U.S. and Japan?","Do you want to go? Yes, please. The ns—I believe, in the first place, we need to try and approach the ns not to launch Taepodong-2, through various efforts, and should they ever launch the missile, that will cause various pressures—we would apply various pressures. And we discussed that. I believe it is best that I do not discuss what specific pressures we were talking about.As we approach the ns, we shall maintain close cooperation and coordination with the United States, including the abduction issue. ——all kinds of opportunities, and the U.N. is an opportunity to express our common concern. You know, another interesting opportunity is, over time, to work on missile defenses. The Japanese cannot be—afford to be held hostage to rockets. And neither can the United States or any other body who loves freedom. And so one really interesting opportunity is for—to share and cooperate on missile defenses.You know, the leader of is just going to have to make a decision: Does he want to be isolated from the world, or is he interested in being an active participant in, kind of, the nations of the world who care about their people and desire peace? It's his choice to make. We've made our choice. We believe it's important for nations such as Japan and the United States to be active participants in the world in a positive way. And that's what we're doing.You know, a lot of the focus of our relationship is based upon, obviously, Iraq and Afghanistan, but the truth of the matter is, Japan and the United States make mighty contributions to end suffering because of disease and hunger. And that's why I appreciate the Prime Minister's leadership. He understands that with economic might comes serious responsibilities in the world. And the United States takes those responsibilities seriously, and so does Japan. Matt [Matt Spetalnick, Reuters].",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a concrete description of the type of cooperation Japan and the United States could undertake to address the North Korean Taepodong‑2 missile threat.

2. **What the answer provides** –  
   - The speaker mentions “approach the [North Korea] not to launch Taepodong‑2, through various efforts, and should they ever launch the missile, that will cause various pressures—we would apply various pressures.”  
   - It notes that “we shall maintain close cooperation and coordination with the United States, including the abduction issue.”  
   - It points to “share and cooperate on missile defenses.”  
   - It references the United Nations as “an opportunity to express our common concern.”  
   - It adds a broader strategic framing about being “active participants in the world.”

3. **Assessment against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – Requires the information to be *explicitly* stated in the requested form. The answer does give some concrete ideas (diplomatic pressure, missile‑defense cooperation, UN involvement), but the description is vague, uses placeholder terms (“various pressures,” “various efforts”), and is interwoven with unrelated remarks. It is not a crisp, directly‑answered statement.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – Would apply if the respondent gave *no* substantive answer at all (e.g., refused, said “I don’t know,” or evaded). Here, the respondent does offer substantive, albeit general, suggestions, so a non‑reply does not fit.  
   - **Ambivalent** – Encompasses answers that are *incomplete, partial, implicit, or somewhat dodging* while still touching on the topic. The response does address the question but does so in a general, somewhat evasive manner, offering only broad outlines rather than a clear, detailed plan.

4. **Conclusion** – The answer provides a partial, somewhat vague response that touches on possible cooperation (pressure, missile‑defense collaboration, UN forum) but stops short of a fully explicit, detailed answer. This matches the definition of an **Ambivalent** response.

211,Do you want the United Nations to impose sanctions on North Korea?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Do you want the United Nations to impose sanctions on North Korea? And how will you go about persuading the Russians and the Chinese to back those moves if you make them? And in addition to that, sir, what kind of threat do you think North Korea poses to world peace right now?","Nontransparent societies run by Governments that aren't selected by the people are—very difficult to tell what's going on. That's part of the problem. We're dealing with a person who was asked not to fire a rocket by the Chinese, the South Koreans, the United States, the Japanese, and the Russians. And he fired seven of them, which then caused the Secretary of State and myself to get on the phone with our partners and reminded them that—of the importance of speaking with one voice.It's to—saying to Kim Jong Il, there is a better way forward for you than isolating yourself from the rest of the world; that there is a opportunity for you to stick to some of your agreements, and that is to verifiably disarm; and that there will be a better life than being isolated and, most importantly, a better life for your people than isolation will bring.And so I was on the phone this morning with Hu Jintao and President Putin, and last night I talked to Prime Minister Koizumi and President Roh. And my message was that we want to solve this problem diplomatically, and the best way to solve the problem diplomatically is for all of us to be working in concert and to send one message, and that is—to Kim Jong Il—that we expect you to adhere to international norms, and we expect you to keep your word.One way to send a message is through the United Nations. And the Japanese laid down a resolution which we support. But we're working with our partners to make sure we speak with one voice. Diplomacy takes a while, particularly when you're dealing with a variety of partners. And so we're spending time diplomatically making sure that voice is unified.I was pleased from the responses I got from the leaders. They, like me, were— are concerned, concerned about a person who doesn't seem to really care about what others say. And so we're working it, working it hard. And it's—and by the way, an effective policy is one which is not just the United States trying to solve problems. So I spent time talking to the Canadian Prime Minister about it. I mean, Canada is a, should be, and must be an active participant in helping deal with problems.He brought up Haiti, for example, in the Oval Office. Canada has made a significant contribution to stability in Haiti in the past.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct answer to a yes/no query: *Does the interviewee want the United Nations to impose sanctions on North Korea?*

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response talks about “one way to send a message is through the United Nations,” mentions that a Japanese‑drafted resolution is supported, and stresses the need for a unified diplomatic voice. However, it never states outright “Yes, I want the UN to impose sanctions” or “No, I do not.” The answer is indirect, provides context, and shifts focus to broader diplomatic strategy.

3. **Information type** – The core request (a clear stance on UN sanctions) is only hinted at, not explicitly affirmed or denied. The answer is therefore incomplete and implicit regarding the specific question.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – Rather than giving a straightforward reply, the speaker deflects by discussing the general diplomatic approach, the importance of speaking with one voice, and other partners. This is characteristic of an **ambivalent** response—information is offered but not in the explicit, complete form requested.

**Conclusion:** The response does not give a clear, explicit answer to the question; it offers only partial, implicit commentary and deflects. This fits the definition of an **Ambivalent** reply.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct answer to the timing question: *Will the meeting with Kim Jong Un occur in the next months?*  
2. **What the answer provides** – The interviewee replies, “Sometime next year, I would say.” This statement explicitly gives a time frame (“next year”) for the meeting. By specifying a time that is *not* “the next months,” the answer directly addresses the question.

213,What would you say to the people attracted to it?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. As you travel the country, you also take credit for tightening regulations on Wall Street through the Dodd-Frank law and about your efforts to combat income inequality. There's this movement--Occupy Wall Street--which has spread from Wall Street to other cities. They clearly don't think that you or Republicans have done enough, that you're, in fact, part of the problem.Are you following this movement, and what would you say to its--people that are attracted to it?","Obviously, I've heard of it. I've seen it on television. I think it expresses the frustrations that the American people feel, that we had the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression, huge collateral damage all throughout the country, all across Main Street, and yet you're still seeing some of the same folks who acted irresponsibly trying to fight efforts to crack down on abusive practices that got us into this problem in the first place.So yes, I think people are frustrated and the protestors are giving voice to a more broad-based frustration about how our financial system works. Now, keep in mind, I have said before and I will continue to repeat, we have to have a strong, effective financial sector in order for us to grow. And I used up a lot of political capital, and I've got the dings and bruises to prove it, in order to make sure that we prevented a financial meltdown and that banks stayed afloat. And that was the right thing to do, because had we seen a financial collapse then the damage to the American economy would have been even worse.But what I've also said is that for us to have a healthy financial system, that requires that banks and other financial institutions compete on the basis of the best service and the best products and the best price, and it can't be competing on the basis of hidden fees, deceptive practices, or derivative cocktails that nobody understands and that expose the entire economy to enormous risks. And that's what Dodd-Frank was designed to do. It was designed to make sure that we didn't have the necessity of taxpayer bailouts. That we said, you know what? We're going to be able to control these situations so that if these guys get into trouble, we can isolate them, quarantine them, and let them fail. It says that we're going to have a consumer watchdog on the job all the time who's going to make sure that they are dealing with customers in a fair way and we're eliminating hidden fees on credit cards and mortgage brokers are going to have to--actually have to be straight with people about what they're purchasing.And what we've seen over the last year is not only did the financial sector, with the Republican Party in Congress, fight us every inch of the way, but now you've got these same folks suggesting that we should roll back all those reforms and go back to the way it was before the crisis. Today, my understanding is, we're going to have a hearing on Richard Cordray, who is my nominee to head up the . He would be America's chief consumer watchdog when it comes to financial products. Now, this is a guy who is well regarded in his home State of Ohio, has been the treasurer of Ohio, the attorney general of Ohio. Republicans and Democrats in Ohio all say that he is a serious person who looks out for consumers. He has a good reputation. And Republicans have threatened not to confirm him not because of anything he's done, but because they want to roll back the whole notion of having a consumer watchdog.You've got Republican Presidential candidates whose main economic policy proposals is, we'll get rid of the financial reforms that are designed to prevent the abuses that got us into this mess in the first place. That does not make sense to the American people. They are frustrated by it. And they will continue to be frustrated by it until they get a sense that everybody is playing by the same set of rules and that you're rewarded for responsibility and doing the right thing as opposed to gaming the system.So I'm going to be fighting every inch of the way here in Washington to make sure that we have a consumer watchdog that is preventing abusive practices by the financial sector.I will be hugely supportive of banks and financial institutions that are doing the right thing by their customers. We need them to be lending. We need them to be lending more to small businesses. We need them to help do what traditionally banks and financial services are supposed to be doing, which is providing business and families resources to make productive investments that will actually build the economy. But until the American people see that happening, yes, they are going to continue to express frustrations about what they see as two sets of rules.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct response to the prompt: *“What would you say to the people attracted to [the Occupy movement]?”* The answer should state the speaker’s message or advice to those protesters.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee explicitly answers by:
   - Acknowledging that they have heard of the movement and that it reflects “the frustrations that the American people feel.”
   - Describing the protesters as “giving voice to a broader‑based frustration about how our financial system works.”
   - Defending the administration’s actions (Dodd‑Frank, preventing a financial collapse, consumer protections).
   - Stating the policy goals (strong financial sector, no hidden fees, ability to let troubled institutions fail).
   - Concluding with a clear stance that the reforms are necessary and that the administration will continue to protect them.

   All of these points constitute a direct, substantive reply to “What would you say to the people attracted to it?”

That's my reaction. We're trying to clarify law. We're trying to set high standards, not ambiguous standards.And let me just repeat, Dave, we can debate this issue all we want, but the practical matter is, if our professionals don't have clear standards in the law, the program is not going to go forward. You cannot ask a young intelligence officer to violate the law. And they're not going to. They—let me finish, please—they will not violate the law. You can ask this question all you want, but the bottom line is—and the American people have got to understand this—that this program won't go forward, if there is vague standards applied, like those in Common Article 3 from the Geneva Convention; it's just not going to go forward. You can't ask a young professional on the frontline of protecting this country to violate law.Now, I know they said they're not going to prosecute them. Think about that: Go ahead and violate it; we won't prosecute you. These people aren't going to do that, Dave. Now, we can justify anything you want and bring up this example or that example; I'm just telling you the bottom line, and that's why this debate is important, and it's a vital debate.Now, perhaps some in Congress don't think the program is important. That's fine. I don't know if they do or don't. I think it's vital, and I have the obligation to make sure that our professionals who I would ask to go conduct interrogations to find out what might be happening or who might be coming to this country—I got to give them the tools they need.

1. **What the question asks** – It requests a concrete reaction to a hypothetical interrogation‑and‑trial scenario involving a U.S. intelligence officer captured by Iran or North Korea. The answer should state how the speaker (the interviewee) would respond to that specific situation.

2. **What the answer provides** –  
   - The speaker begins with “David, my reaction is…,” but instead of describing a reaction to the particular scenario, they shift to a general discussion about adopting standards in the “detainee detention act,” clarifying law, and setting “high standards.”  
   - The response is largely rhetorical: it talks about the importance of clear legal standards, the need to avoid vague provisions like Common Article 3, and the obligation to give professionals “clear law.”  
   - There is no explicit statement such as “I would condemn the trial,” “I would demand a fair process,” or any direct commentary on the secret‑evidence conviction described in the question.  
   - The answer repeatedly circles back to abstract principles rather than addressing the hypothetical scenario head‑on.

3. **Evaluation against the classification categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – The information is *not* explicitly stated; the answer does not directly answer “how would you react?”  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – The answer does give some related content (talking about standards, law, etc.), so it is not a total refusal or ignorance.

215,And is it maybe time for you to apply some of that direct pressure you referred to earlier?,"Q. Mr. President, are you disappointed that the Israelis and the Palestinians haven't made more specific progress since Annapolis? And is it maybe time for you to apply some of that direct pressure you referred to earlier?And for the Prime Minister, did you offer any new assurances to the President—or do you plan to—that Israel will stop disputed settlement and construction activity?","Step one of any complicated process that is going to require a lot of hard work and serious dialogue is whether the mindset is right. It's one thing for somebody to say to the President, sure, we're for a two state, just to make the President feel okay. That's not the case here. The fundamental questions that I was seeking at Annapolis and on my return trip is the understanding about the power of what a vision will do for peace.You know, one of the concerns I had was that, whether it be the unprovoked rocket attacks or the issues of settlement, that the leaders would be so bogged down in the moment that they would lose sight of the potential for a historic agreement. And I've come away with the belief that while those issues are important and certainly create consternation amongst the respective constituencies, that both leaders are determined to make the hard choices necessary.Now, implicit in your question is whether or not the President should butt in and actually dictate the end result of the agreement. In my judgment, that would cause there to be a nonlasting agreement. In my judgment, the only way for there to be a vision that means something is for the parties to seriously negotiate that vision. If you're asking me, am I nudging them forward, well, my trip was a pretty significant nudge, because yesterday they had a meeting.And by the way, the atmosphere in America was, nothing is going to happen, see; that these issues are too big on the ground. Therefore, you two can't get together and come up with any agreements. You just heard the man talk about their desire to deal with core issues, which, I guess for the uneducated on the issue, that means dealing with the issues like territory and right of return and Jerusalem. Those are tough issues—the issue of Israeli security. And they're going to sit down at the table and discuss those issues in seriousness.And I've been briefed today from the Israeli perspective of those discussions. Tomorrow I'll be briefed by the Palestinians about their interpretation.Now, there's three tracks going on, by the way, during this process. One is the vision track. Let me just make sure everybody understands—in our delegation—the goal. The goal is for there to be a clear vision of what a state would look like so that, for example, reasonable Palestinian leadership can say, here's your choice: You can have the vision of Hamas, which is dangerous and will lead to war and violence, or you can have the vision of a state, which should be hopeful.The second track is to help both parties deal with roadmap issues. Settlements is a roadmap issue; security is a roadmap issue, in a certain limited sense. Third issue is to help the Palestinians, one, organize their security forces so that they can better assure their own people and, equally importantly, better assure Israel that they can deal with the extremists in their midst. That's what General Dayton is doing here, for example. Or an economic track—listen, the best way to make sure that the Palestinians realize there's a hopeful future in which it's in their interests to live at peace with Israel is for them to realize that they've got an economy in which they can make a living. And Tony Blair is helpful on that, and so is America.And so you're watching three tracks parallel each other. And the one, of course, you're asking about is whether or not the leadership has got the willingness and the desire and the drive to design a state, compatible to both sides. And my answer is, yes, I think they will. I hope that I don't disappoint anyone—certainly not the President, because we talked at length— if I will say that the President didn't ask for me to make any commitments other than the ones that Israel made already with regard to the peace process and as I have spelled it out on many different occasions, including in Annapolis, which was a very, as I said, a very important event. The commitment of Israel is absolutely to carry on in this process in order to realize the vision of two states living side by side, as I said before.Now, there are many issues. Settlement is one of the issues. We made clear our position. And I know that sometimes not everyone is happy with this position, but we are very sincere. And we were never trying to conceal any of these facts from anyone, starting with President Bush and Secretary Rice and, of course, our Palestinian partners.They know that there is a moratorium on new settlements and the new expropriation of land in the Territories. But they also know, and we have made it clear, that Jerusalem, as far as we are concerned, is not in the same status. And they know that the population centers are not in the same status. And there might be things that will happen in the population centers or in Jerusalem which they may not be in love with, but we will discuss them, and we will not hide them. We are not going to build any new settlements or expropriate land in the Territories. We made it clear, and we will stand by our commitments. And we will fulfill all our commitments as part of the roadmap because this is an essential part for any progress that will have to take place in the future.But there are some aspects only just realized which one can't ignore, and everyone knows that certain things in Jerusalem are not in the same tactical level as they are in other parts of the Territories which are outside the city of Jerusalem. And so it's true about some population centers. So there was nothing that happened that was not known in advance to all our partners in this process. We made clear our positions. We made clear exactly what we can do, what we can't do, what we want to do, and what we will not be able to do. And I think that they all know it, and they—at least even when sometimes they disagree with us, they at least respect our sincerity and openness about these issues.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking whether the speaker thinks it is now appropriate to apply “direct pressure” that was previously mentioned. The expected answer would be a clear judgment (e.g., “Yes, it is time,” or “No, it is not yet time,” possibly with justification).

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response does not give a direct yes/no or any explicit assessment of applying pressure. Instead it:
   - Talks about “mindset,” “vision,” and “hard choices.”
   - Describes the importance of a shared vision for peace.
   - Mentions that the leaders are determined to make choices.
   - Shifts the discussion to “three tracks,” “vision track,” etc.
   - Ends with a truncated statement about Palestinian leadership choices.

   The answer never explicitly says whether “direct pressure” should now be applied, nor does it explain the speaker’s stance on that specific issue.

3. **Information type** – The response is **partial and implicit**. It touches on related themes (vision, determination, negotiation) but leaves the core question about applying pressure unanswered. It is therefore incomplete and indirect.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker sidesteps the specific query by expanding the discussion to broader diplomatic considerations, which amounts to a deflection rather than a straightforward answer.

**Conclusion:** The answer provides only an incomplete, indirect, and somewhat evasive treatment of the question without delivering a clear judgment. This fits the definition of an **Ambivalent** response.

216,Concern about the attack on Beirut Airport,"Q. Does the Beirut—the attack on the Beirut Airport, does that concern you, and are you concerned about triggering a wider Middle East war?","As I mentioned, my biggest concern is whether or not actions taken will weaken the Siniora Government. Democracy in Lebanon is an important part of laying a foundation for peace in that region. We have worked really hard to get Syria out of Lebanon—U.N. Resolution 1559 and its followup, Resolution 1680, were manifestations of the work of the international community to get Syria out of Lebanon. We've always felt that a democracy in Lebanon is important for the Lebanese people, and it's important for the region.So the concern is that any activities by Israel to protect herself will weaken that Government. And we have made that—or topple that Government—and we've made it clear in our discussions.Having said all that, people need to protect themselves. There are terrorists who will blow up innocent people in order to achieve tactical objectives. In this case, the objective is to stop the advance of peace— which is a remarkable statement, isn't it— willing to kill to stop peace.We have a good chance to get a two-state solution, two democracies living side by side in peace. It is a clear and achievable vision. There is a way forward called the roadmap to achieve that vision.

   a) Whether the attack on Beirut Airport **concerns** the interviewee, and  
   b) Whether the interviewee is **concerned about triggering a wider Middle East war**.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response never directly states whether the attack on Beirut Airport concerns the speaker. Instead, it talks generally about:

   The answer is vague, indirect, and does not give a clear yes/no or any explicit statement about the specific concern regarding the Beirut Airport attack or the risk of a wider war.

3. **Information type** – The requested information is **not fully provided**; it is only hinted at in a roundabout way. The speaker offers related themes (stability, democracy, terrorism) but does not answer the specific question.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The response deflects from the precise query and instead discusses broader political concerns, which fits the definition of an **ambivalent** answer—partial, implicit, and deflecting rather than a clear reply or a complete non‑reply.

217,"Is the administration at this time trying to play it both ways by appeasing the critics, suggesting that troop withdrawal is right around the corner, at the same time making no real commitments?","Q. Okay. So is the administration at this time trying to play it both ways by appeasing the critics, suggesting that troop withdrawal is right around the corner, at the same time making no real commitments?","Suzanne, I think I went on to say on Air Force One, if I recall, somewhere between Baghdad and Sydney, that, why don't we all just wait and see what David Petraeus says when he comes— General Petraeus, when he comes back to America. He and Ambassador Crocker are going to come back, and they're going to report to me and report to the Congress and the American people about their recommendations on the way forward. I will then take their recommendations into account as I develop the strategy necessary to win in Iraq.That's what I'm interested in. I'm not interested in artificial timetables or dates of withdrawal; I'm interested in achieving objective. I repeat: If you think it's not important that we're there, then you're going to find excuses to get out. If you think it is important to be there, then you ought to be thinking about ways to achieve our objectives. And we are achieving our objectives.And so I was being as candid as I could with the people on the airplane. And what I said in Baghdad was exactly what they told me: That if conditions still improve, security conditions still improve the way they have been improving, is that we may be able to provide the same security with fewer troops. And whether or not that's the part of the policy I announce to the Nation when I get back from this trip, after the Congress has been briefed on David Petraeus and Ryan Crocker—why don't we see what they say—and then I'll let you know what our position is and what our strategy is.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct judgment about whether the administration is simultaneously “appeasing critics” by hinting that a troop withdrawal is imminent while at the same time “making no real commitments.” The question expects a clear yes/no or an explicit assessment of that political strategy.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not answer the question with a straightforward yes or no. Instead, he:
   - Shifts the focus to waiting for General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker’s recommendations.
   - States that he is “not interested in artificial timetables or dates of withdrawal.”
   - Emphasizes that any decision will be based on achieving objectives, not on arbitrary timelines.
   - Repeats his own candor about conditions improving.

   While these remarks touch on the substance of the allegation (i.e., that the administration is avoiding firm withdrawal dates), they do not directly answer whether the administration is “playing it both ways.” The response is therefore indirect and leaves the core question unanswered.

3. **Information type** – The answer provides **partial, implicit information** about the administration’s stance (it rejects artificial timetables) but stops short of giving a clear, explicit evaluation of the alleged dual‑track strategy. It is neither a full denial nor an admission; it merely deflects and offers a broader context.

4. **Evasion vs. completeness** – The response is not a total non‑reply (the question is addressed, albeit indirectly), nor is it a clear, unambiguous answer. It is best characterized as **incomplete and somewhat evasive**, fitting the definition of an *ambivalent* reply.

**Conclusion:** The interviewee’s answer is incomplete and indirect, offering only a partial, implicit response rather than a clear affirmation or denial of the allegation.

Again, how can you say your policy is more successful, given that North Korea has apparently tested a nuclear weapon? And also, if you wouldn't mind, what is the redline for North Korea, given what has happened over the past few months?","My point was, bilateral negotiations didn't work. I appreciate the efforts of previous administrations. It just didn't work. And therefore, I thought it was important to change how we approached the problem so that we could solve it diplomatically. And I firmly believe that with North Korea and with Iran that it is best to deal with these regimes with more than one voice, because I understand how it works. What ends up happening is, is that we say to a country such as North Korea, Here's a reasonable way forward. They try to extract more at the negotiating table, or they've got a different objective, and then they go and say, Wait a minute; the United States is being unreasonable. They make a threat. They could—they say the world is about to fall apart because of the United States problem. And all of a sudden, we become the issue.But the United States message to North Korea and Iran and the people in both countries is that we have—we want to solve issues peacefully. We said there's a better way forward for you. Here's a chance, for example, to help your country economically. And all you got to do is verifiably show that you—in Iran's case, that you suspended your weapons program, and in North Korea's case, that you've got international safeguards on your program— which they agreed to, by the way.And so my point is, is that—to the American people I say, Look, we want to solve this diplomatically. It's important for the President to say to the American people, diplomacy was what—is our first choice and that I've now outlined a strategy. And I think it is a hopeful sign that China is now a integral partner in helping North Korea understand that it's just not the United States speaking to them.And it's an important sign to North Korea that South Korea, a country which obviously is deeply concerned about North Korean activities—South Korea is a partner, and that if North Korea decides that they don't like what's being said, they're not just stiffing the United States—I don't know if that's a diplomatic word or not—but they're sending a message to countries in the neighborhood that they really don't care what other countries think, which leads to further isolation. And when we get a U.N. Security Council resolution, it will help us deal with issues like proliferation and his ability—he being Kim Jong Il's ability— to attract money to continue to develop his programs.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct justification: *How can you claim your policy is more successful when North Korea has tested a nuclear weapon?* The expected answer would be a clear statement comparing past and current policy outcomes and explaining why the new approach is superior.

2. **What the answer does** – The interviewee does not give a concise “Yes, because …” or “No, because …” response. Instead, they:
   - Re‑state that bilateral negotiations “didn’t work.”
   - Explain a broader strategic rationale (multilateral pressure, offering economic incentives, involving China, etc.).
   - Shift the focus to diplomatic messaging and the need for international consensus.
   - Provide a general defense of the policy without directly addressing the nuclear‑test fact or explicitly stating why the current policy is “more successful.”

3. **Nature of the response** – The answer is:
   - **Partial** – It touches on relevant points (failure of past talks, need for a different approach) but never directly answers the comparative success claim.
   - **Implicit/Deflective** – The speaker reframes the issue rather than stating a clear, explicit justification.
   - **Incomplete** – The core question (“how can you say your policy is more successful?”) remains only partially addressed; the response stays at a high level of justification without a concrete comparison.

4. **Classification decision** – Because the information requested is given in an incomplete, indirect, and somewhat evasive manner—characteristics that match the “Ambivalent” category—the appropriate label is **Ambivalent**.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct assessment of whether the Vladimir Putin who made the quoted statement is the same individual whose “soul” the speaker previously found trustworthy. The expected answer would be a clear “yes” or “no,” or a brief statement confirming or denying the identity.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response never gives a straightforward yes/no. Instead it:
   - Refers vaguely to “the person who I was referring to in 2001” and calls him “a strong‑willed person.”
   - Describes a series of disagreements and common goals with Putin (NATO, security, proliferation).
   - Mentions that Putin “disagrees” with the speaker’s assessment of NATO.
   - Concludes with a generic statement about a “complicated relationship” and the ability to find common ground.

   The answer touches on the identity of Putin but does so indirectly, using surrounding commentary rather than a crisp affirmation or denial.

3. **Information type** – The core information (whether the two references describe the same person) is **implicit** and **partial**. The speaker hints that it is the same individual but does not explicitly state “yes, it is the same Putin” or “no, it is not.” The response is therefore incomplete with respect to the question’s demand for a clear judgment.

4. **Evasion / deflection** – The reply shifts focus to broader themes (NATO, cooperation, disagreements) rather than answering the yes/no query directly. This is characteristic of a deflection rather than a straightforward answer.

5. **Classification decision** –  
   - It is **not** a *Clear Reply* because the answer does not explicitly state the requested fact.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking for a direct judgment: *Does the interviewee regret not acting differently, given the “long history of deception” they previously cited?* The expected answer would be a clear statement of regret (or lack thereof).

2. **What the answer contains** – The interviewee launches into a broad discussion about using the moment to promote diplomacy, mentions past optimism about a joint statement, and talks about security obligations. The response never mentions **regret**, never evaluates the decision in hindsight, and never directly addresses the “history of deception” argument.

3. **Nature of the response** –  
   * It is **not a clear reply** because the requested information (a statement of regret) is not explicitly given.  
   * It is **not a clear non‑reply** either, because the interviewee does provide some related content (talking about diplomacy, past optimism, etc.).

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a concrete description of the conditions or assurances that would make President Putin believe the missile‑defense system is *not* a threat to Russian security.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee directly lists several specific conditions that would satisfy that concern:
   - Working jointly on a global missile‑defense system with **equal, democratic‑style access** to its management.  
   - Ensuring **transparency** and **verification** through permanent expert presence at the sites.  
   - Building a **framework** that includes confidence‑building measures and mutual oversight.

   These points are presented as the “best guarantee of security for all” and are explicitly tied to convincing Russia that the system is not aimed against it.

3. **Is the information explicit?** – Yes. The answer spells out, in plain language, what would be required to convince Russia of the system’s non‑threatening nature. It does not merely hint or deflect; it enumerates concrete steps (joint work, transparency, verification, equal access).

4. **Is there evasion or incompleteness?** – The response stays on‑topic and does not refuse to answer. While the language is somewhat broad, it nonetheless provides the substantive content the question requests.

5. **Conclusion** – The response meets the definition of a **Clear Reply**: the requested information is explicitly stated in the form asked.

1. **What the question asks**  
   - The interviewer wants a concrete prediction or description of Russia’s reaction if the U.S. proceeds with the missile‑defense system *and* expands NATO to include Ukraine and Georgia.

2. **How the answer addresses it**  
   - The interviewee does not give a simple “Russia would …” statement.  
   - Instead, the response is a long, indirect discourse that:  
     * Re‑states that the U.S. and Russia have made progress on missile‑defense cooperation.  
     * Emphasizes the need for transparency, verification, and joint management of the system.  
     * Says that if the project fails, Russia would “insist that the system … verification matters … could function on an ongoing basis … with the help of experts.”  
     * Then shifts to NATO enlargement, saying Russia “reaffirmed its position” and that “in order to improve relations with Russia, it is necessary not to pull the former Soviet republics into political/military blocs, but to develop relations with Russia itself.”  

   - The answer touches on both parts of the question (the missile‑defense response and NATO expansion) but does so in a **general, vague, and somewhat evasive** manner. It offers no explicit prediction of concrete Russian actions (e.g., retaliation, sanctions, diplomatic protest) and instead frames the issue in terms of “opportunity,” “framework,” and “conditions” that would make Russia comfortable.

3. **Information type**  
   - The response is **incomplete**: it provides partial, implicit, and somewhat deflective commentary rather than a clear, direct answer.  
   - It is not a total refusal to answer (so it is not a *Clear Non‑Reply*).  
   - It is also not an explicit, straightforward statement of Russia’s response (so it is not a *Clear Reply*).

4. **Conclusion**  
   - Because the answer supplies a **partial, implicit, and somewhat dodging** reply that does not clearly articulate how Russia would react, it fits the **Ambivalent** category.

**LABEL: Ambivalent**","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to that specific question: ""How would Russia respond if the U.S. went ahead with this anyway, as well as bringing Ukraine and Georgia into NATO?""

223,Did they discuss the schedule of further exchanges for the remaining part of the year?,"Q. My question is—first to both Presidents—you mentioned that yesterday and today you summed up the 8 years of your cooperation. I would like to ask you, if you assess your work, have there been more pluses or minuses? And please tell me, what have you achieved, and what concrete things will be bequeathed to your successors? Do you think the world has become a safer and more secure place? And how has the U.S.-Russian relationship influenced world politics?And my question to the United States now—to the President of the United States now—you have met President-elect today— Dmitry Medvedev. You talked about the impression you have of him. I would like to ask you, did you discuss the schedule of your further exchanges with him in the course of this year—for the remaining part of this year?","Okay, I will start answering. Has it become better, or has it become worse? We always want to have more of a good thing, and we shouldn't forget that the—as we say, the better is the worst enemy of the good.Let us remember the world on the brink of a nuclear disaster during the Caribbean crisis, and now let us look at the U.S.Russia relationship today. A crisis like the Cuban crisis would not be possible now; it would be unthinkable. I agree with George when he said that Russia and the United States no longer consider each other as enemies. At a minimum, they look at each other as partners, and I believe this is very important.Of course, a lot of outstanding issues remain. It is true that we do have disagreements on some sensitive areas of our cooperation, but at the same time, we do have enough strength to search for solutions. And as our meeting today has shown, we are capable of achieving positive re-sults—that is, on the whole—in counterterrorism, in fighting proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missile technology, of fighting the drug threat. All of these create a reliable platform for cooperation, not only between Russia and the United States but a platform that contributes to ensuring international security.If we mention on top of that our economic cooperation, we can state that in the past 8 years, we have been able to improve the relations between our two countries and in the world as a whole. Yes, I agree with that answer. And secondly, I spent—I told President-elect that I would see him in Japan at the G-8, and that's the only scheduling matters that we discussed. And I'm going to finish out my term—my time with Vladimir, and then I'll turn my attention to the President when he gets to be the President.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking the interviewee to comment on whether they consider themselves a moral leader (“As a moral leader though?”). The expected response would be a direct statement about the interviewee’s view of their own moral leadership.

2. **What the answer contains** – The interviewee replies:  
   - “I think I am a great moral leader, and I love our country.”  
   This is a clear, explicit declaration about their self‑perception as a moral leader. The rest of the answer (“Go ahead, please. Bipartisanship//House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi”) is extraneous but does not obscure the explicit statement made.

3. **Does the answer provide the requested information?** – Yes. The core of the response directly answers the question by stating the interviewee’s view (“I think I am a great moral leader”). The information is given in the requested form (a direct answer).

4. **Is it a non‑reply or ambivalent?** – No. The answer is not evasive, incomplete, or vague about the moral‑leader claim; it affirms it outright. It is not a refusal or a request for clarification.

He had been wounded in Afghanistan, had come to Iraq for treatment. He had ordered the killing of a U.S. citizen in Jordan. I never said there was an operational relationship.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct judgment: *Does the interviewee still believe there is a relationship among Saddam Hussein, Zarqawi, and Al Qaeda?* The expected answer would be a clear “yes,” “no,” or a qualified statement indicating the interviewee’s current belief.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not give a straightforward yes/no response. Instead, they:
   - Re‑state that they never claimed an *operational* relationship.
   - Explain that Saddam was a state sponsor of terror and that Zarqawi was in Iraq.
   - Shift the focus to broader arguments about removing Saddam and “dangerous” behavior.
   - End with a general statement about believing the world is better off without Saddam, but they never explicitly say whether they still believe a link exists.

3. **Information type** – The response is **partial and implicit**. It touches on related facts but stops short of answering the specific query about current belief in a relationship. The answer is therefore incomplete with respect to the question asked.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker avoids a direct answer, using the opportunity to reiterate prior positions and broader arguments rather than addressing the question head‑on.

226," Do you feel that he's looking at what's been offered to the Iranians by the world community in terms of incentives and saying, I'd like a little of that for myself?","Q. Does he pose—come to the booth, sir, I'll tell you who it was. [Laughter] Does he pose any particular unique problems to deal with? And do you feel that he's looking, for instance, at what's been offered to the Iranians by the world community in terms of incentives and saying, I'd like a little of that for myself?","It's hard for me to tell you what's on his mind. He lives in a very closed society. It's unlike our societies where we have press conferences and people are entitled to ask questions, and there's all kinds of discussions out of administrations and people saying this, saying that, and the other. This is a very closed society.We do know there's a lot of concentration camps. We do know that people are starving. As a matter of fact, our Nation has tried to help feed the hungry. But what we don't know is his intentions, and so I think we've got to plan for the worst and hope for the best. And planning for the worst means to make sure that we continue to work with friends and allies, as well as those who've agreed to be a part of the six-party talks, to continue to send a unified message.We've also got a very strong Proliferation Security Initiative, because one of the threats that can emanate from a closed society, particularly one that claims to have nuclear weapons, is proliferation. One of the real dangers we face is weapons of mass destruction in the hands of people who would like to continue to hurt us, hurt the United States or hurt Canada, hurt anybody who has the courage to stand up and embrace freedom, see. That's the big threat.And so we don't know, Jim, about his intentions, but we take—we're planning. And so one of the things we've done— and I thank Canada's contribution—is for there to be a very strong initiative to prevent proliferation, through what we call the Proliferation Security Initiative. And it's an important initiative. It's a way to say, we're not going to allow you to threaten us; we're not going to allow you to—the rocket— as I say, I'm not exactly sure what the azimuth was of the rocket. We've got our people still analyzing that. But, for example, we didn't—we don't know what was on the rocket. We don't know where the rocket was headed. It would have been helpful, of course, had he said, Here's what we're going to do. Here's our intentions. Here's what—we want to work with you; we want to explain it. Who knows—maybe send a satellite—who knows what his intention was.But that's not the way he decided to deal with it. He just decided to say—to start firing, and he fired seven of them. And we take this seriously. We take, and we all should take, threats seriously. That's one of the lessons of September the 11th, is that what takes place in other parts of the world can come home to hurt the American people. See, a failed government in Afghanistan enabled plotters and planners to train and then come and kill 3,000 of our citizens. And so it used to be that's it's okay if something were happening from afar, oceans could protect us. I presume that's how some in Canada used to feel. The lesson of September the 11th is, is that we're vulnerable, and therefore, we've got to deal with each threat.I've assured the American people and assured our friends and allies, we want to deal with threats diplomatically. The best way to deal with threats diplomatically is to encourage others to be a part of the process. And that's what we're doing. That's why we've got the six-party talks.And one of the keys in the six-party talks is for all the nations to send clear messages to Kim Jong Il. That's why I was on the phone this morning, saying as clearly as I could to our fellow partners, four other leaders, to say, let's send a common message that you won't be rewarded for ignoring the world and that you'll be isolated if you continue to do this, and yet there's a way forward.See, I care deeply about the people in . I truly do. It breaks my heart to know that young children are literally starving to death. And I wish—I just wish at some point in time there was an openness in that society where we could help save lives. I'm also realistic enough to realize what weapons of mass destruction could mean in the world in which we live.And so we're working this issue hard. We're working the Iranian issue hard. Steve and I talked about a strategy going into the G-8 session. I talked to President Putin this morning abut making sure that not only do we send messages to the ns but that our strategy will work with Iran.And it's just really important for the American President to see the world the way it is, not the way we would hope it would be, and to deal with threats, and to do so in a way that will achieve results. And it takes a while. I mean, these threats didn't arise overnight, and these problems won't be solved overnight. But we've got strategies in place to deal with them.And one of the reasons why it's important to have Steve here is so we can talk about how we can work together to deal with it. And they're not just threats to our security that normal people think of. HIV/AIDS on the continent of Africa is a threat to our security in the long run. That's why I'm proud to report the United States took the lead on setting up the Global Fund, as well as bilateral programs to help save people's lives. I think it's in our interests. I also happen to believe in the admonition, To whom much is given, much is required.And so we've got a robust foreign policy on a lot of fronts, and I intend to keep it that way. And I'm confident that what we're doing is going to make this world a better place. And I'm proud to have allies like Steve who understand the stakes of the 21st century.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants to know whether the interviewee believes that the person in question is studying the incentives that the international community has offered Iran and is seeking a share of those incentives for himself.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response never directly answers that query. Instead it:
   - Talks generally about the closed nature of the society,
   - Discusses intentions being unknown,
   - Mentions planning for the worst, proliferation, and rocket launches,
   - Returns to vague statements about threats and analysis.

   The answer skirts the specific premise about “incentives offered to the Iranians” and does not state whether the interviewee thinks the person is looking at those incentives.

3. **Information type** – The response provides only indirect, peripheral remarks. It is not a straightforward “yes” or “no,” nor is it a complete refusal to answer; rather, it offers a partial, implicit, and somewhat evasive commentary that does not satisfy the request for a clear judgment.

4. **Classification decision** – Because the answer does give some related commentary (e.g., “we don’t know his intentions”), but it remains incomplete, implicit, and deflects from the precise question, it fits the **Ambivalent** category: the information is given but in an incomplete, indirect, and partially dodging manner.

227, Concerns of Provoking North Korea to Higher Levels of Hostility,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Since it's such a pleasant day, I was hoping you'd consent to let me ask two questions. The first one, on reports that there's a new policy on intercepting North Korean ships at sea, if you could say anything about that. And are you concerned that that could provoke North Korea to new levels, higher levels of hostility?","Well, this is not simply a U.S. policy; this is a international policy. This was part of what the Security Council resolution calls for, is the interdiction of arms shipments. How that's going to be implemented, how we approach cooperation between various countries to enforce this, is something that the United States, South Korea, China, Russia, all relevant actors--Japan--all relevant actors will be discussing in the months to come.But I want to emphasize something that President Lee said. There's been a pattern in the past where behaves in a belligerent fashion, and if it waits long enough, is then rewarded with foodstuffs and fuel and concessionary loans and a whole range of benefits. And I think that's the pattern that they've come to expect.The message we're sending--and when I say we, not simply the United States and the Republic of Korea, but I think the international community--is we are going to break that pattern. We are more than willing to engage in negotiations to get on a path of peaceful coexistence with its neighbors, and we want to encourage their prosperity. But belligerent, provocative behavior that threatens neighbors will be met with significant, serious enforcement of sanctions that are in place.And I think it may not have been fully acknowledged the degree to which we have seen much tougher sanctions voted out unanimously, in fairly rapid order, over the last several weeks. And I expect that that signals the degree to which we're serious about enforcement.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants to know whether the speaker is worried that the new policy of intercepting North Korean ships might cause North Korea to become more hostile.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The speaker directly acknowledges the concern:
   - “I think that’s the pattern that they’ve come to expect…”
   - “The message we’re sending… is we are going to break that pattern.”
   - “Belligerent, provocative behavior… will be met with significant, serious enforcement of sanctions.”
   - The speaker also notes that tougher sanctions have been voted on and that this signals seriousness about enforcement.

   In doing so, the speaker explicitly states that the policy is intended to **prevent** further hostility and that any provocation will be met with firm enforcement. This is a clear, explicit response to the concern about provoking higher levels of hostility.

3. **Information type** – The requested information (the speaker’s concern about provoking North Korea) is **fully and explicitly provided**. There is no evasion, no vague or partial answer; the speaker directly addresses the issue.

4. **Conclusion** – Because the answer clearly and explicitly states the speaker’s stance on the potential for heightened hostility and how it will be handled, it fits the definition of a **Clear Reply**.

**Classification:** Clear Reply  

**LABEL:** Clear Reply","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to the specific question: ""Concerns of Provoking North Korea to Higher Levels of Hostility"". The answer addresses concerns, says they will break pattern, will enforce sanctions, etc. It explicitly addresses concern about provoking higher hostility, stating they will enforce sanctions, but also says they want to encourage prosperity, etc. It seems to give a clear answer: they are concerned but will enforce sanctions, they want to break pattern, etc. It\'s explicit about concern and response.

228,Alignment of the President's perspective with the Defense Secretary's response,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Your Defense Secretary, Robert Gates, was recently asked by New York Times columnist David Brooks if knowing what he knows now, invading Iraq was a good idea. And I believe your Defense Secretary answered, I don't know. Does that represent daylight with you? Is that second-guessing? Have you spoken to the Defense Secretary? And does that change your mind at all?","I think he made it pretty clear the removal of Saddam—I don't know about this column, but I know his previous statements, he said getting rid of Saddam Hussein was the right decision. But I haven't talked to him about the column. If I had to ask everybody in my Government to respond to columns and news stories, that's all I'd be doing, is talking to people in my Government.I am absolutely convinced Secretary Gates knows that removing Saddam was the right thing, and I'm absolutely convinced he believes we will succeed in . And so I've got a lot of trust in the man. He's doing a fine job as the Secretary.Martha [Martha Raddatz, ABC News].",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks to know whether the President’s view lines up with the Defense Secretary’s reported answer (“I don’t know”) about the Iraq invasion. In other words, does the President agree with, distance himself from, or otherwise comment on the Secretary’s stance?

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The President explicitly states:
   - “I think he made it pretty clear the removal of Saddam … was the right decision.”
   - “I am absolutely convinced Secretary Gates knows that removing Saddam was the right thing.”
   - “I’ve got a lot of trust in the man… He’s doing a fine job.”
   These statements directly convey that the President **does** share the Secretary’s perspective (i.e., removal of Saddam was the right decision) and that he trusts the Secretary’s judgment.

3. **Information type** – The requested alignment is **explicitly provided**: the President affirms agreement with the Secretary’s position and expresses confidence that they are on the same page.

4. **Evasion or incompleteness?** – There is no evasion or vague deflection; the answer directly answers the alignment question.

**Conclusion:** The response gives a clear, explicit answer to the question about the alignment of the President’s perspective with the Defense Secretary’s response.

**LABEL: Clear Reply**","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to the specific question: ""Alignment of the President\'s perspective with the Defense Secretary\'s response"".

The answer given: President says he thinks Gates made it clear removal of Saddam was right decision, he hasn\'t talked to him about column, he trusts Gates, believes he knows removal was right, etc. So does the answer address alignment? It indicates that President believes Gates agrees with him, i.e., alignment. It explicitly states that Gates knows removal was right, and President is convinced. So the information requested is explicitly stated: the President\'s perspective aligns with Gates; he trusts Gates, believes they agree. That is a clear reply. It\'s not non-reply nor ambivalent.

230,Concern about the impact of a sagging economy on John McCain's chances of winning the election.,"Q. Mr. President, bad economic news continues to pile up, the latest today, with the GDP barely growing. Are you concerned that a sagging economy and hard times will help defeat John McCain like it did your father in 1992? And how far are you willing to go to prevent that?","I'm concerned about the economy because I'm concerned about working Americans, concerned about people who want to put money on the table and save for their kids' education. That's why I'm concerned about the economy. I want Americans working.And there's no question, the economy has slowed down. You just cited another example of slowdown. I don't think we're headed to a recession, but no question, we're in a slowdown. And that's why we acted, and acted strongly, with over $150 billion worth of progrowth economic incentives, mainly money going into the hands of our consumers and some money going to incent businesses to invest, which will create jobs.And so we've acted robustly. And now it's time to determine whether or not this progrowth package will actually work. Now the checks will start going out in the second week of May. There are going to be letters out soon explaining who is eligible for the refunds. Credit will happen in the first week of May. In other words, some people will choose to have their bank accounts credited. And in the second week of May, we anticipate the checks start moving out of Washington.And the purpose is to encourage our consumers. The purpose is to give them money—their own to begin with, by the way—but give them money to help deal with the adverse effects of the decline in housing value. Consumerism is a significant part of our GDP growth. And we want to sustain the American consumer, encourage the American consumer, and at the same time, we want to encourage investment. So we'll see how the plan works.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct answer about the interviewee’s *concern* that a weakening economy could *help defeat John McCain* in the upcoming election (and how far the interviewee is willing to go to prevent that).

2. **What the answer provides** – The response talks broadly about the economy, working Americans, stimulus measures, and the need to sustain consumer spending. It never mentions John McCain, the election, or the political implications of the economy. The answer is therefore *not* a direct response to the political‑impact question; it merely discusses the economy in general terms.

3. **Nature of the response** – Because the answer sidesteps the specific political query and instead offers a generic discussion of economic policy, it is **incomplete** with respect to the requested information. It is not a refusal to answer (the interviewee does answer something), nor is it a clear, explicit statement about the political concern.

4. **Classification decision** – The response fits the definition of **Ambivalent**: the information requested is given in an incomplete, indirect, and somewhat deflecting way rather than being fully explicit or refusing to answer outright.

231,Are U.S.-Russian relations deteriorating?,"Q. Mr. President, on Russia, is the Vladimir Putin who said, The United States is undermining global security and provoking a new arms race, the same Vladimir Putin whose soul you looked into and found to be trustworthy? Has he changed? Are U.S.-Russian relations deteriorating?","I think the person who I was referring to in 2001 is the same strong-willed person. He is a person with whom I have had agreements and disagreements throughout the course of my Presidency and his. We've disagreed on the utility of NATO. I've tried to convince Vladimir that NATO is positive; it's a positive influence; that democracies on your border are good things to have. Democracies tend not to fight each other. And I firmly believe NATO is a stabilizing influence for the good, and that helps Russia. Evidently, he disagrees with that assessment; part of his speech was expressing concerns about NATO.There's a lot we can work together on, and that's what's important for American people to understand. We know that we've got common goals that make sense for both our peoples. Two such goals are , convincing the ians to get rid of its nuclear weapons. And Russia's leadership on this issue is very important to getting a Chapter VII resolution out of the United Nations. And by the way, they were constructive, in terms of the resolution I just described about North Korea. In other words, where we have common interests and we work together on those common interests, we can accomplish important things for the security of our own people as well as the security of the world.And secondly, Russia and the United States work very closely on proliferation concerns. We're both concerned about the proliferation of technologies that could end up hurting our people and other people in the world.And so there's—it's a complicated relationship. It's a relationship in which there are disagreements, but there's also a relationship in which we can find common ground to solve problems.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct assessment of the current state of U.S.–Russian relations: *Are they deteriorating?*

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee discusses many aspects of the relationship (disagreements over NATO, cooperation on nuclear non‑proliferation, common goals, etc.). He notes that there are both disagreements and areas of common ground, describing the relationship as “complicated.” However, he never explicitly states whether the overall relationship is deteriorating.

3. **Information provided** – The response is **partial and implicit**. It offers relevant context (disagreements and cooperation) but stops short of giving a clear, affirmative or negative answer to the specific query.

4. **Evasion or deflection?** – The answer does not outright refuse to answer, nor does it claim ignorance. Instead, it sidesteps the precise yes/no formulation by presenting a nuanced description.

5. **Classification decision** – Because the information is given but only in an incomplete, indirect, and somewhat evasive manner, it fits the **Ambivalent** category: the requested answer is provided only partially and implicitly, without a clear, explicit statement.

Mr. President, your administration had all summer to negotiate with lawmakers on the detainee legislation. How is it that you now find yourself in a situation where you have essentially an open rebellion on Capitol Hill led by some of the leading members of your own party, very respected voices in military affairs? And secondly, would you veto the bill if it passes in the form that the Armed Services Committee approved yesterday?","First, we have been working throughout the summer, talking to key players about getting a bill that will enable the program to go forward, and was pleased that the House of Representatives passed a good bill with an overwhelming bipartisan majority out of their committee, the Armed Services Committee. And I felt that was good progress. And obviously, we've got a little work to do in the Senate, and we'll continue making our case. But, no, we've been involved—ever since the Supreme Court decision came down, Sheryl, we've been talking about both the military tribunals and this Article 3 of the Geneva Convention.The Article 3 of the Geneva Convention is hard for a lot of citizens to understand. But let's see if I can put it this way for people to understand. There is a very vague standard that the Court said must kind of be the guide for our conduct in the war on terror and the detainee policy. It's so vague that it's impossible to ask anybody to participate in the program for fear— for that person having the fear of breaking the law. That's the problem.And so we worked with members of both bodies and both parties to try to help bring some definition to Common Article 3. I really don't think most Americans want international courts being able to determine how we protect ourselves. And my assurance to people is that we can pass law here in the United States that helps define our treaty—international treaty obligations. We have done that in the past. It is not the first time that we have done this. And I believe it's necessary to do it this time in order for the program to go forward.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants an explanation of why the President is facing an “open rebellion on Capitol Hill” led by prominent members of his own party. The expected answer should directly address that political situation.

2. **What the answer provides** – The interviewee does not explain the rebellion at all. Instead, the response shifts to a discussion of:
   - Summer work on legislation,
   - The House bill’s passage,
   - The need for Senate action,
   - The Supreme Court decision and “Article 3 of the Geneva Convention,”
   - General statements about defining treaty obligations.

   None of these points address the premise of an “open rebellion” or name the party members involved.

And so that's what Secretary Rice is working toward with our friends and allies.Look, everybody is—I understand both parties aren't going to agree with all aspects of the resolution. But the intent of the resolutions is to strengthen the Lebanese Government so Israel has got a partner in peace. The intent of the resolution is to make sure that we address the root cause— the resolution is to address the root cause, which was a state operating within the state. Hizballah was—or is an armed movement that provoked the crisis.And so whatever comes out of the resolutions must address that root cause. And so the task today for the Secretary and her counterparts is to develop a resolution that can get passed. It is essential that we create the conditions for the Lebanese Government to move their own forces, with international help, into the south of Lebanon to prevent Hizballah and its sponsors from creating this—creating another crisis.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants to know *how* a resolution can be crafted that both Lebanon and Israel would be willing to back. In other words, the question seeks a concrete description of the strategy or conditions that would lead to a mutually acceptable resolution.

2. **What the answer provides** – The interviewee:
   - Talks generally about stopping violence and the “spirit” of past conferences.
   - Mentions the intent of resolutions to strengthen the Lebanese government and address the “root cause” (e.g., Hizballah’s armed activity).
   - Describes the need to create conditions for the Lebanese government to act with international help.
   - Ends with a statement about developing a resolution that can be passed.

   However, the response never spells out *the specific steps or conditions* that would guarantee both sides’ support. It remains at a high‑level, descriptive level, offering context rather than a clear, actionable plan.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – Not satisfied; the answer does not explicitly state “Here is how we will get a resolution both sides will support.”  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – Not satisfied; some relevant information is given (e.g., focus on root causes, Lebanese government empowerment).  
   - **Ambivalent** – Satisfied; the answer provides partial, somewhat general information about the intent and conditions but stops short of a definitive, complete answer, leaving the core question only partially addressed.

   - It never states outright “Yes, I still think it’s wrong” or “No, I no longer think it’s wrong.”  
   - Instead, it says the Government “is not prepared to open a missile‑defense issue at this time” and that “it should be obvious… why the United States and others would want a modern defense system.”  
   - The answer therefore offers only an indirect, vague stance—essentially sidestepping the explicit yes/no query.

3. **Evaluation against the classification categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – Requires the requested information to be explicitly stated. The answer does **not** give a clear, explicit answer to the yes/no question.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – Would apply if the respondent gave *no* relevant information at all (e.g., “I don’t know,” or refused to answer). Here, some related information is provided, albeit indirectly.  
   - **Ambivalent** – Fits when the answer is given but is incomplete, partial, implicit, or evasive. The response is indeed incomplete and evasive: it hints at a position without stating it directly, deflects with unrelated remarks, and leaves the core question unanswered.

4. **Conclusion** – The answer partially addresses the topic but does so in an incomplete, indirect, and evasive manner, failing to provide a straightforward answer. This matches the definition of an **Ambivalent** response.

235,Putting off immigration reform until the new Congress,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On another of your top priorities, immigration, leaders of both parties have indicated that any chance of comprehensive immigration reform is dead before the election. Is this an issue you would like to revisit in a lame-duck session after the election? Or would it be put off until the new Congress?","Bob, I strongly believe that in order to protect this border, Congress has got to pass a comprehensive plan that on the one hand provides additional money to secure the border and on the other hand recognizes that people are sneaking in here to do jobs Americans aren't doing. It would be better that they not sneak in, that they would come on a temporary basis, in an orderly way, to do work Americans aren't doing and then go home. And I will continue to urge Congress to think comprehensively about this vital piece of legislation.I went up to the Hill yesterday, and of course this topic came up. It's exactly what I told the Members of Congress. They wanted to know whether or not we were implementing border security measures that they had funded last January, and the answer is, we are. One of the key things I told them was we had ended what's called catch-and-release. That was a—you know, a Border Patrol agent would find somebody, particularly from—not from Mexico, and would say, Well, we don't have enough detention space, so why don't you come back and check in with the local person you're supposed to check in with, and then they'd never show back up. And that, of course, frustrated the Border Patrol agents; it frustrates American citizens; it frustrates me. And we ended it because Congress appropriated money that increased the number of beds available to detain people when we get them sneaking into our country illegally.The border has become modernized. And Secretary Chertoff here, later on this month, will be announcing further modernizations, as he has led a contract that will use all kinds of different technologies to make the border more secure. But in the long run, to secure this border, we've got to have a rational work plan.And finally, we're going to have to treat people with dignity in this country. Ours is a nation of immigrants, and when Congress gets down to a comprehensive bill, I would just remind them, it's virtually impossible to try to find 11 million folks— who have been here, working hard and, in some cases, raising families—and kick them out. It's just not going to work. But granting automatic citizenship won't work either. To me, that would just provide an additional incentive for people to try to sneak in, and so therefore, there is a rational way forward. I'll continue working—I don't know the timetable. My answer is, as soon as possible; that's what I'd like to see done.Thank you. Let's see, Wendell. Coming your way. Everybody is going to get one.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a clear answer about the *timing* of immigration reform: will the issue be taken up in a lame‑duck session after the election, or will it be postponed until the new Congress?

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not give a direct answer about timing. Instead, the response:
   - Talks broadly about the need for a comprehensive immigration bill.
   - Describes border‑security measures and personal anecdotes.
   - Mentions urging Congress to act “as soon as possible” but never specifies whether that will happen in a lame‑duck session or be delayed.
   - The answer is general, indirect, and does not explicitly state the intended legislative schedule.

3. **Information type** – The response is **partial and implicit**. It touches on the topic of immigration reform but leaves the specific question about “lame‑duck vs. new Congress” unanswered. The information is therefore incomplete and indirect.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker shifts to a broader discussion of border security and legislative urging rather than answering the timing question directly, which is a form of deflection.

**Conclusion:** The answer provides the requested information only in an incomplete, vague manner and does not give a clear, explicit response to the timing question.

236,What is the President's reaction to the deal where the Government of Dubai would buy a share of the NASDAQ stock market?,"Q. Mr. President, there's a deal taking shape this morning where the Government of Dubai would buy a share of—a stake in the NASDAQ stock market. And there is some concern being expressed on Capitol Hill about this. It's another deal involving, you know, people overseas that we might not trust. What's your reaction to it? And also, what's your level of concern about protectionism in general?","My reaction is, is that we have a reform process in place that will be able to deal with this issue. In other words, we're going to take a good look at it as to whether or not it has any national security implications involved in the transaction. And I'm comfortable that the process will go forward.John, I'm also—I am concerned about protectionism. I'm concerned about it because if the United States loses its confidence when it comes to trading, it will make it less likely our economy would grow. And I just told you, one of the underpinnings of our support is the fact that exports—for economic vitality—is the fact that exports are up, and workers benefit when we're selling products overseas. And I believe these free trade agreements will be an interesting test of protectionism, whether protectionism is real.We've got four trade agreements that we've negotiated that we want to get passed, and there's going to be some crucial votes coming up here pretty soon in the Congress. And we'll work hard to get all four trade agreements through. And if they don't get through, it is a sign that the protectionists are beginning to be on the ascendancy here in Washington, DC, and that would be a mistake. And for people who are deeply concerned about poverty around the world like I am, the best way to help lift people out of poverty is through free trade agreements. And that's why we're dedicated to the Doha round that is—that Secretary Schwab is so actively engaged in—not Secretary Schwab, trade negotiator Schwab. And we're committed to reach an accord with these nations so that—because trade helps poor people realize a better life. And it's a proven fact.I'm also worried about isolationism. Isolationism tends to run hand in hand with protectionism. You'll find isolationists are those who say it's not our business what happens overseas, it doesn't matter if there's a free society in the heart of the Middle East, as far as our long-term security and peace. I just strongly reject that. I think it does matter a lot that the United States is working with other nations to promote liberty and freedom because I believe liberty is a change agent. Liberty can help hostile parts of the world become peaceful parts of the world.You know, our strategy in dealing with these extremists who still want to attack us is on the one hand, chase them and find them and bring them to justice, and on the other hand, help change the conditions that caused 19 kids to get on airplanes and come and kill nearly 3,000 citizens on our soil. The best way to do that is to be active with foreign policy. It's not to lose faith in values, but to actively promote universal values. And isolationists would say, it's not worth it, doesn't matter to the United States of America. Well, I think it does matter, and I think it matters a lot.Herman [Ken Herman, Cox News], have you got a question?",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

238,Is it factually accurate that the administration had no meetings on bin Laden for 9 months after he left office?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Former President Clinton says that your administration had no meetings on bin Laden for 9 months after he left office. Is that factually accurate, and how do you respond to his charges?","You know, look, Caren, I've watched all this finger-pointing and naming of names and all that stuff. Our objective is to secure the country. And we've had investigations; we had the 9/11 Commission; we had the look back this; we've had the look back that. The American people need to know that we spend all our time doing everything that we can to protect them. So I'm not going to comment on other comments.But I will comment on this—that we're on the offense against an enemy who wants to do us harm. And we must have the tools necessary to protect our country. On the one hand, if Al Qaida or Al Qaida affiliates are calling somebody in the country, we need to know why. And so Congress needs to pass that piece of legislation. If somebody has got information about a potential attack, we need to be able to ask that person some questions. And so Congress has got to pass that piece of legislation.You can't protect America unless we give those people on the frontlines of protecting this country the tools necessary to do so within the Constitution. And that's where the debate is here in the United States. There are some decent people who don't believe—evidently don't believe we're at war and therefore shouldn't give the administration what is necessary to protect us.And that goes back to Jennifer's question, you know. Does being on the offense mean we create terrorists? My judgment is, the only way to defend the country is to stay on the offense. It is preposterous to think if we were to withdraw and hope for the best, things would turn out fine against this enemy. That was my point about, before we were in Iraq, there were thousands being trained in Afghanistan to strike America and other places. The only way to protect this country is to stay on the offense, is to deal with threats before they fully materialize and, in the long term, help democracy succeed, like Afghanistan and Iraq and Lebanon and a Palestinian state.But there's a difference of opinion. It will come clear during this campaign, where people will say, Get out, leave before the job is done. And those are good, decent, patriotic people who believe that way; I just happen to believe they're absolutely wrong. So I'm going to continue to work to protect this country. And we'll let history judge—all the different finger-pointing and all that business. I don't have enough time to finger-point. I've got to stay—I've got to do my job, which comes home every day in the Oval Office, and that is to protect the American people from further attack.Now, there are some who say, Well, maybe it's not going to happen. Well, they don't see what I see. All I ask is that they look at that terror plot that, along with the Brits, we helped stop—people who were going to get on an airplane and blow up innocent lives in order to achieve political objectives. They're out there; they're mean; and they need to be brought to justice.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does **not** state whether the claim is true or false. Instead, the response:
   - Shifts to a broader discussion of investigations, the 9/11 Commission, and legislative tools.
   - Uses vague, general statements about protecting the country and “finger‑pointing.”
   - Ends with a series of rhetorical points about offense, democracy, and history, without ever confirming or denying the specific factual allegation.

3. **Information type** – The core factual claim is left **unaddressed**. The answer is therefore **incomplete** and **implicitly evasive**; it offers related themes but does not supply the requested factual assessment.

239,What steps will you be doing in order to help Iraq to get out of chapter 7?,"Q.

What steps will you be doing in order to help Iraq to get out of chapter 7?","Well, this is an area that Prime Minister Maliki emphasized, and we have made a strong commitment to work with Iraq to get out of the chapter 7 constraints that were imposed after the gulf war. As I stated before, it, I think, would be a mistake for Iraq to continue to be burdened by the sins of a deposed dictator.Now, in order to do that, we're going to have to obtain cooperation from various members of the United Nations. I think that there are going to have to be some specific disputes that are resolved between Iraq and some of its neighbors. We intend to be very constructive in that process, but we have said clearly, and I've repeated today to the Prime Minister, that we will work diligently with Iraq so that, in fact, Iraq is no longer within chapter 7. Okay? President Obama and the American administration agree with us that Iraq is no longer representing a threat to international peace and security because there is a democracy in Iraq, not a dictatorship. Iraq is looking forward to positive, constructive relationship with its Arab neighbors and with the international community and to deal in—through a law internally and injustice internally.I have seen a clear commitment from the President and the administration to support Iraq and to be committed to all elements of the agreement and to help Iraq to get out of chapter 7 and international sanctions which were imposed as a result of the ventures and the wars that were led by Saddam's regime, including occupying the neighboring state of Kuwait.Iraq has gone a long way, and it will continue to solve all problems.

   - “We will work diligently with Iraq so that, in fact, Iraq is no longer within Chapter 7.”
   - “We have to obtain cooperation from various members of the United Nations.”
   - “There are going to have to be some specific disputes that are resolved between Iraq and some of its neighbors.”
   - The overall commitment is to “work diligently with Iraq” and to “help Iraq to get out of Chapter 7.”

   These statements directly answer the question by naming the kinds of actions that will be undertaken (cooperation with the UN, dispute resolution, constructive engagement, diligent work with the Iraqi government).

   - Shifts the discussion to praising Ben Bernanke and to fiscal policy.
   - Talks about tax policy and the budget, but never addresses the adequacy of the rate cut or any further financial measures.

3. **Does the answer give the requested information?** – No. The core request—evaluating the sufficiency of the rate cut—is completely untouched. The response is unrelated to the question and therefore fails to supply any answer.

4. **Which classification fits?**

Given your support and respect for the Court, are you willing to rethink how you use your Presidential authority?","I am willing to abide by the ruling of the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court said that in this particular case, when it comes to dealing with illegal combatants who were picked up off a battlefield and put in Guantanamo for the sake of our security, that we should work with the United States Congress to develop a way forward. They didn't say we couldn't have done—made that decision, see. They were silent on whether or not Guantanamo—whether or not we should have used Guantanamo. In other words, they accepted the use of Guantanamo, the decision I made. What they did say was, in terms of going forward, what should the court system look like? How can we use a military commission or tribunal?And we'll work with the United States Congress. They have said, work with the Congress. I have been waiting for this decision in order to figure out how to go forward. I want to move forward. First of all, I stand by the decision I made in removing these people from the battlefield. See, here's the problem: These are the types of combatants we have never faced before. They don't wear uniforms, and they don't represent a nation-state. They're bound by an ideology. They've sworn allegiance to individuals but not to a nation. The Geneva Conventions were set up to deal with armies of nation-states. You've got standard rules of war.So this is new ground. This is different than any President has been through before, in terms of how to deal with these kind of people that you're picking up off a battlefield and trying to protect the American people from.So we have about 600 or so there, and 200 have been sent back home. We'd like to send more back to their countries of origin. Some need to be tried, and the fundamental question is, how do we try them? And so in working with the Supreme—in listening to the Supreme Court, we'll work with Congress to achieve that objective.And so your question is slightly loaded, which is okay; I'm used to it.

The answer: ""I am willing to abide by the ruling of the Supreme Court... They didn\'t say we couldn\'t have done—made that decision... We\'ll work with Congress... I stand by the decision I made...

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct answer to the yes/no query “Are you still pursuing him?”  
2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee begins with “Absolutely,” which is an unequivocal affirmative. The rest of the response adds surrounding commentary, but the core answer to the question is explicitly given.  
3. **Information provided** – The requested information (whether the pursuit continues) is stated outright; there is no evasion of the core question, only additional elaboration.  
4. **Category fit** – Because the answer explicitly affirms the pursuit (“Absolutely”), it meets the definition of a **Clear Reply** (the information requested is explicitly stated in the requested form).

Mr. President, we know that you talked about Iran and North Korea. Let me ask you if you moved forward at all on these issues? Did you ask Russia to take specific steps, for example with Iran, to agree to U.N. sanctions? Did you discuss what you could move on—in North Korea to move it forward?And, President Putin, is Russia now willing, if necessary, to vote for sanctions in the United Nations to stop Iran's nuclear preparations?","We strategized on both issues. But this isn't the first time that we've talked together to—on how to solve problems. You might remember that Russia proposed a very interesting way forward for . It was the Putin Government that said to the ians, If you want a civilian nuclear power program, we will support you in that; however, we will provide the fuel, and we'll collect the spent fuel. I thought it was a very innovative approach to solving the problem. I strongly supported the initiatives.So, Bill [Bill Plante, CBS News], to answer your question, this isn't the first time that we have strategized on how to solve this problem. And, yes, we talked about the U.N. Security Council resolution. And, no, I'm not going to tell you the particulars about the conversation. I will tell you, however, that there is common agreement that we need to get something done at the U.N., and I'm confident we will be able to do that. And there's agreement that we need to get something done on North Korea at the United Nations.Here's the thing, though, just so that everybody understands: Diplomacy is not two countries just saying, this is the way it is. Diplomacy is two countries agreeing to work together with other countries, in this case, to come up with common language that we can live with that sends the same message, and that is, no nuclear weapons programs.Our goal and objective is to have a nuclear-free—nuclear weapons-free Korean Peninsula. Russia shares that objective, China shares the objective, Japan shares the objective, and South Korea shares the objective. So we've got common ground to move forward, and now we're working on language. And it was a very constructive meeting. You know, I have spoken on this count for many times. I can repeat, it is not in Russia's national interest to see a proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, especially in such an explosive region as the Middle East.This is something that we tell our ian partners directly. We have always told them about it. There is nothing novel or new about our position in this respect. But we work on the assumption that we have to find efficient ways of ensuring security around the world. We need to take efficient diplomatic steps that would not disrupt the gentle fabric of the negotiations in the search for mutually acceptable decisions. And we're satisfied with the status of the U.S.-Russia relationship in this area.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking President Putin a *direct, yes‑or‑no* question: *Is Russia now willing, if necessary, to vote for UN sanctions to stop Iran’s nuclear preparations?* The expected answer would be an explicit statement of willingness (e.g., “Yes, we are prepared to vote for sanctions” or “No, we are not prepared”).

2. **What the answer contains** – The response is a long, indirect statement that:
   - Talks about “strategizing” on Iran and North Korea.
   - Mentions a “common agreement” that something must be done at the UN.
   - Says there is “agreement that we need to get something done on North Korea at the United Nations.”
   - Describes general diplomatic goals and shared objectives.
   - Ends with a vague assertion that “Russia shares that objective” and that “we are satisfied with the status of the U.S.–Russia relationship in this area.”

   **Crucially, the answer never states explicitly whether Russia is willing to vote for sanctions.** It discusses the *goal* of a nuclear‑free peninsula and the *shared objective* but stops short of answering the specific question about willingness to cast a vote for sanctions.

3. **Evaluation against the classification categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – Requires the requested information to be *explicitly* stated. The answer does **not** give a clear “yes” or “no.”  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – Would apply if the respondent *refused* to answer or gave no relevant content at all (e.g., “I don’t know,” “I decline to answer”). Here, some related content is provided, though it is indirect.  
   - **Ambivalent** – Fits when the answer is *incomplete, partial, implicit, or deflecting* while touching on the topic. The response discusses the broader context and shared goals but **avoids a direct answer** to the specific question, thereby providing only an incomplete/implicit answer.

4. **Conclusion** – The interviewee’s reply is **ambivalent**: it touches on the subject matter but fails to give the explicit, complete answer the question demands, instead offering a vague, generalized statement.

244,"Have you found a solution to the case of computer hacker Gary McKinnon, as discussed last year?","Q. Mr. President, you've talked about the need for robust action on your country's deficit and debt positions. Do you agree with the Prime Minister's supporters that he led the way on the issue, or do you feel that, in fact, he has traveled too far and too fast?And could I just ask you both, as a sidebar, this time last year, we talked about the case of computer hacker Gary McKinnon, on which the Prime Minister has expressed very clear views. You said you would work together to find a solution. So have you found one?","Well, on your second question, Mr. McKinnon, we have proceeded through all the processes required under our extradition agreements. It is now in the hands of the British legal system. We have confidence in the British legal system coming to a just conclusion. And so we await resolution and will be respectful of that process.With respect to how we deal with debt and deficits, I said 2 years ago, the first time I came here, in April of 2009, the first G-20 summit that I attended, that each country is different and each country is going to have to make a range of decisions about how to--at that time--dig our way out of the worst recession that we'd experienced since the 1930s, at the same time that we put our countries on a path of sustainable growth that ultimately results in jobs and prosperity for our people and a growing middle class across the board.And we've succeeded in the first part, which is to yank the world economy out of recession, and that was in large part due to concerted action between the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries.Now we've got that other challenge, which is how do we sustain growth in a way that's responsible and responsive to the needs of our people. That requires us to continue to make investments in education, science, technology, infrastructure, things that help our economies grow. But it also means governments that live within their means.And obviously, the nature and role of the public sector in the United Kingdom is different than it has been in the United States. The pressures that each country are under from world capital markets are different. The nature of the debt and deficits are different. And as a consequence, the sequencing or pace may end up being different.But the one thing that I'm absolutely clear about is David and I want to arrive at the same point, a point in which we're making sure that our governments are doing what they need to do to ensure broad-based prosperity, but doing so in a responsible way that doesn't mortgage our futures and leave a mountain of debt to future generations.And the other point I think David and I would agree on is that this is going to be a constant process of trying some things, making adjustments. There are going to be opportunities for us to make investments. There are going to be other areas where we think those were good ideas at the time, programs that were started with the best of intentions, and it turns out they're not working as well as they should. If a program is not working well, we should get rid of it and put that money into programs that are working well. It means that we've got to make sure that we take a balanced approach and that there's a mix of cuts, but also thinking about how do we generate revenue so that there's a match between money going out and money coming in.And each country is going to have to go through what is a difficult and painful process. What I'm confident about is that we're going to be able to come out of this stronger than we were before. And I think that both the people of the United Kingdom and the people of the United States want to see a government that's reflective of their values, the fact that they take their responsibilities seriously, they pay their bills, they make sure that their families are cared for, they make sacrifices where necessary in order to ensure that their children and their grandchildren are succeeding. And they want those same values reflected in their government, and I think that both our countries are going to be able to achieve that. Thank you. First of all, in the case of Gary McKinnon, I mean, I understand the widespread concern about this case, and it's not so much about the alleged offense, which everyone knows is a very serious offense; it's about the issue of the individual and the way they're treated and the operation of the legal system and, as the President said, making sure that legal system operates properly and carefully.The case is currently in front of the Home Secretary, who has to consider reports about Gary's health and his well-being, and it's right that she does that in a proper and effectively quasi-judicial way.I totally understand the anguish of his mother and his family about this issue. We must follow the proper processes and make sure this case is dealt with in the proper way. And I'm sure that that is the case.On the issue of deficit reduction, I mean, I remember when we also spoke about this at the G-20, but even before that, when you first came here when you were running as a candidate. And I completely agree with Barack that each country is different and has different circumstances. I mean, Britain does not have a reserve currency. We're not in the same position as the U.S. with the dollar. And I think it was necessary for us to set out on the path of deficit reduction without delay after the election.And I would argue the proof of that for the U.K. has been what has happened in capital markets. And as the President just said, capital markets treat different countries differently. Well, in the European context, what you've seen since the election is actually market interest rates in the U.K., bond yields effectively come down. Whereas you look at what's happened in Greece or in Portugal or other European countries, you've often seen those bond rates increase. That, in my view, is the risk we would have run if we had not set out on the path of deficit reduction.But each country is different, but when I look across now and see what the U.S. and the U.K. are currently contemplating for the future, it's actually a relatively similar program in terms of trying to get on top of our deficits and make sure that debt is falling as a share of GDP. Because as the President said, we, in the end, share a very similar set of values about not wanting to load responsibility for these debts on our children and not wanting to shirk our own responsibilities for straightening out our own public finances.So, as he said, we may take slightly different paths, but we want to end up in the same place. It's an extremely difficult thing to have to do--dealing with your public finances, getting on top of your deficit--but it's absolutely essential. And we've talked a lot today about national security. In the end, there's no national security unless you have economic security. And that's an argument that we have to make and win every day here in the United Kingdom. Christi Parsons [Chicago Tribune], last question.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

And the answer there is that those troops would be—would create a sensation around the world that may not enable us to achieve our objective.

   The interviewer is asking for a direct judgment: *“Is it because there is a fear that the U.S. doesn’t have credibility in the region?”* They want a yes/no or an explicit explanation linking the decision not to include U.S. troops to a credibility concern.

2. **How the answer addresses it**  
   - The respondent begins with a historical reference (“there has been a history in Lebanon with U.S. troops”) and then talks about offering logistics and command‑and‑control support.  
   - They bring up a Darfur example and discuss when the U.S. would commit troops, but they never directly answer the credibility‑fear question.  
   - The response ends with a statement about “the best use of U.S. forces” and a citation of a reporter, leaving the original query unanswered.

3. **Information provided**  
   - The answer is **partial** and **indirect**. It mentions related topics (logistics, past deployments, Darfur) but does not explicitly state whether fear of losing credibility is a factor, nor does it give a clear affirmative or negative response.  
   - Because the core question is left unaddressed, the reply is **incomplete** and **deflective**.

1. **What the question asks**  
   - It seeks an explanation of the speaker’s omission: why they referenced Hizballah rockets but not Israeli bombings, and why they appear to “give Israel a pass.”  
   - The answer should directly address the perceived double‑standard or justification for that stance.

   - The speaker says: “Yes, thank you. I like to remind people about how this started, how this whole—how the damage to innocent life, which bothers me—but again, what caused this?”  
   - This response:  
     * Does not explicitly explain why Israeli bombings were omitted.  
     * Does not address the accusation of “always giving them a pass.”  
     * Shifts focus to a generic reminder about origins and innocent‑life damage, leaving the core question unanswered.  
     * Uses vague, indirect language and deflects rather than providing a clear justification.

3. **Information type**  
   - The answer is **incomplete and indirect**. It offers a general sentiment (“damage to innocent life bothers me”) but fails to clarify the specific reason for the omission or the alleged bias.  
   - It is neither a full refusal to answer nor a precise, explicit reply; it is a partial, implicit deflection.

1. **What the question asks:**  
   The interviewer is requesting a clarification of the interviewee’s position on living with a nuclear‑armed North Korea. In other words, “Are you prepared to accept/co‑exist with a nuclear North Korea?” The answer should state the interviewee’s stance.

2. **What the answer provides:**

3. **Does the answer meet the criteria for a “Clear Reply”?**  
   - **Explicitly stated:** Yes. The response is a straightforward “No,” which unambiguously conveys the stance.  
   - **In the requested form:** The question asks for clarification on the stance; the answer gives that clarification in the simplest, explicit form.

2. **How the answer responds** –  
   - The interviewee says, “I am saying that I would hope that they would adopt the same standards we adopt…”  
   - This expresses a *hope* that others follow the same standards, but it never explicitly says “I would be okay” or “I would not be okay.”

3. **Information provided** – The answer is **partial and implicit**. It hints at a position (that other countries should adopt the same standards) but does not directly answer whether the speaker would be “okay” with divergent interpretations. The reply is vague, uses conditional language, and veers into unrelated policy discussion.

Did you discuss what you could move on—in North Korea to move it forward?And, President Putin, is Russia now willing, if necessary, to vote for sanctions in the United Nations to stop Iran's nuclear preparations?","We strategized on both issues. But this isn't the first time that we've talked together to—on how to solve problems. You might remember that Russia proposed a very interesting way forward for . It was the Putin Government that said to the ians, If you want a civilian nuclear power program, we will support you in that; however, we will provide the fuel, and we'll collect the spent fuel. I thought it was a very innovative approach to solving the problem. I strongly supported the initiatives.So, Bill [Bill Plante, CBS News], to answer your question, this isn't the first time that we have strategized on how to solve this problem. And, yes, we talked about the U.N. Security Council resolution. And, no, I'm not going to tell you the particulars about the conversation. I will tell you, however, that there is common agreement that we need to get something done at the U.N., and I'm confident we will be able to do that. And there's agreement that we need to get something done on North Korea at the United Nations.Here's the thing, though, just so that everybody understands: Diplomacy is not two countries just saying, this is the way it is. Diplomacy is two countries agreeing to work together with other countries, in this case, to come up with common language that we can live with that sends the same message, and that is, no nuclear weapons programs.Our goal and objective is to have a nuclear-free—nuclear weapons-free Korean Peninsula. Russia shares that objective, China shares the objective, Japan shares the objective, and South Korea shares the objective. So we've got common ground to move forward, and now we're working on language. And it was a very constructive meeting. You know, I have spoken on this count for many times. I can repeat, it is not in Russia's national interest to see a proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, especially in such an explosive region as the Middle East.This is something that we tell our ian partners directly. We have always told them about it. There is nothing novel or new about our position in this respect. But we work on the assumption that we have to find efficient ways of ensuring security around the world. We need to take efficient diplomatic steps that would not disrupt the gentle fabric of the negotiations in the search for mutually acceptable decisions.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct answer to whether the speaker *asked Russia to take specific steps* (e.g., to support U.N. sanctions on Iran). The expected response would be a clear “yes” or “no,” or a brief statement describing the request.

2. **How the answer addresses it** –  
   - The speaker begins with “We strategized on both issues” and mentions talking about the U.N. Security Council resolution, but immediately follows with “I’m not going to tell you the particulars about the conversation.”  
   - The response then shifts to a general discussion of diplomacy, shared objectives, and the need for “efficient diplomatic steps,” without ever stating explicitly whether a request was made to Russia.  
   - The answer is vague, indirect, and avoids giving the specific information requested.

3. **Information type** – The response is **partial and implicit**. It touches on related themes (strategizing, common goals, U.N. action) but does not clearly answer the question. It deflects by refusing to disclose “particulars” and by providing only general statements.

4. **Evasion check** – Yes. The speaker sidesteps the precise query about asking Russia for specific steps, instead offering a broad, non‑committal commentary.

253,Do you agree with the comparison between Hamas and Al Qaida?,Q. Do you agree with the comparison between Hamas and Al Qaida?,"I believe that Hamas, in its own description of its agenda, has not renounced violence and has not recognized the State of Israel. And until they do, it is very difficult to expect Israelis to have a serious conversation, because ultimately, they have to have confidence that a Palestinian state is one that is going to stick to its--to whatever bargain is struck, that if they make territorial compromises, if they arrive at a peace deal, that, in fact, that will mean the safety and security of the Jewish people and of Israel. And Hamas has not shown any willingness to make the kinds of concessions that Fatah has, and it's going to be very difficult for us to get a Palestinian partner on the other side of the table that is not observing the basic Quartet principles that we both believe--that both David and I believe in: the need to renounce violence, recognize the State of Israel, abide by previous agreements.That is, I think, going to be a critical aspect of us being able to jump-start this process once again. Thank you. I described the President's speech as bold and visionary because I think it did an absolutely vital thing, which was to talk about '67 borders with land swaps. So as the President said, if you think about what both sides absolutely need to know to start this process, those two things are in place.First, that the Israelis need to know that America and her allies like Britain will always stand up for Israel's right to exist, right to defend herself, right to secure borders. That is absolutely vital that the Israelis know that their security is absolutely key to us. They need to know that.But the second thing that needs to be done is the Palestinians need to know that we understand their need for dignity and for a Palestinian state, using the '67 borders and land swaps as the start point. That is, I think, what is so key to the speech that's been made. So neither side now has, I believe, the excuse to stand aside from talks.On the specific issue of U.N. recognition, the President is entirely right that in the end, the Palestinian state will only come about if the Palestinians and the Israelis can agree to it coming about. That is the vital process that has to take place.As for Britain, we don't believe the time for making a decision about the U.N. resolution--there isn't even one there at the moment--is right yet. We want to discuss this within the European Union and try and maximize the leverage and pressure that the European Union can bring, frankly, on both sides to get this vital process moving.Both of us in recent days have been to the Republic of Ireland. I went on part of the Queen's historic trip, and I know Barack has just returned from a very successful trip. And when you look at what had to happen in Northern Ireland in order for peace to come about, is there has to be some recognition and understanding on each side of the other side.And that is what I think is so crucial in what the President is saying about Hamas and Palestinian unity, which should in some ways be a welcome development if the Palestinians can have one group of people, but not unless those group of people are prepared to accept some of what the people they're going to negotiate with desperately need.And that, in the end, is why the peace process in Northern Ireland was successful, because both sides had some understanding of what the other side needed for some dignity and for some peace. And that is what we badly need right now in the Middle East. And I think the President's speech has been a good step forward in really helping to make that happen. Thank you. Let me just pick up on what David said about Ireland. It was inspiring to see, after hundreds of years of conflict, people so rapidly reorienting how they thought about themselves, how they thought about those who they thought once were enemies. Her Majesty's visit had a profound effect on the entire country. And so it was an enormous source of hope. And I think it's a reminder that as tough as these things are, if you stick to it, if people of good will remain engaged, that ultimately even the worst of conflicts can be resolved.But it is going to take time. And I remain optimistic, but not naively so, that this is going to be hard work and each side is going to have to look inward to determine what is in their long-term interests, and not just what are in their short-term tactical interests, which tends to perpetuate a conflict as opposed to solving it.And finally, let me--also, David, I--just very briefly, thank you for expressing your condolences and concern about the people of Missouri. We have been battered by some storms not just this week, but over the last several months, the largest death toll and devastation that we've ever seen from tornadoes in the United States of America. Knowing that we've got friends here in the United Kingdom who care deeply and who offer their thoughts and prayers makes all the difference in the world. So thank you very much for that. Thank you. And the Guinness wasn't bad in Ireland, either. Yes, it was very good. Thank you. Thank you.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct judgment: *Does the interviewee agree with the comparison between Hamas and Al Qaida?* The expected answer would be a clear “Yes,” “No,” or a qualified “I think the comparison is ….”

2. **What the answer does** – The interviewee launches into a discussion of Hamas’s stance on violence, Israel’s security concerns, and the need for Palestinian partners to meet Quartet principles. While this touches on the *content* of the comparison, it never states whether the speaker **agrees** with the comparison itself. The response is indirect, providing context rather than a straightforward agreement or disagreement.

3. **Nature of the response** –  
   - It is **not a clear reply** because the core request (a yes/no or explicit stance on the comparison) is not answered explicitly.  
   - It is **not a clear non‑reply** because the interviewee does provide related information about Hamas and the comparison’s implications; the answer is not a complete non‑answer or a refusal.  
   - It **is incomplete and evasive** – the speaker deflects from the specific question and instead offers a broader commentary. This matches the definition of an **ambivalent** response: the information is given but only partially, implicitly, and in a way that dodges the direct question.

255,"What can President Bush and President Putin do to stop the violence and fighting in the Middle East, given the divisions among allies concerning Israel's use of excessive force?","Q. The violence in the Middle East is escalating despite calls for restraint. What can you, President Bush and President Putin, do to stop the violence, stop the fighting, given that there is divisions among allies here about whether Israel is using excessive force?","I think you'll find all parties here want the violence to stop. In my judgment, the best way to stop the violence is to understand why the violence occurred in the first place. And that's because Hizballah has been launching rocket attacks out of Lebanon into Israel and because Hizballah captured two Israeli soldiers. That's why we have violence.And the best way to stop the violence is for Hizballah to lay down its arms and to stop attacking. And therefore, I call upon Syria to exert influence over Hizballah.Now, here's my concern, is that we were making good progress toward a two-state solution in the Middle East. The Israeli Prime Minister came to Washington and talked to me about his desire for there to be a democracy living side by side with another democracy, said this was part of his strategic vision for Israel and for peace.And he was working toward that end. As you know, he made efforts to reach out to President Abbas, who we support. He made efforts to reach out to countries in the neighborhood to help achieve this vision. And as the vision was progressing, certain elements—certain terrorist elements began to act to stop the advance of democracy. The militant wing of Hamas made decisions to attack and to capture. Hizballah has made decisions to stop the advance of a two-state solution.The solution—short-term solution is for Hizballah to stop the attacks. The longer-term solution is for nations around the world and nations in the neighborhood to support those who support the advance of democracy. I agree with the premise that it is absolutely unacceptable to try and reach this or that goal, including political goals, through the use of force, through abductions, through carrying out strikes against an independent state from the territory of another state. This is all true. And in this context, we consider Israel's concerns to be justified.At the same time, we work under the assumption that the use of force should be balanced. And in any case, bloodshed should stop as soon as possible. This should be the point of departure for the efforts to create an enabling environment for the resolution of the entire set of problems. Escalation of violence, in our opinion, will not yield positive results.At any rate, we share the approach with We will take every necessary effort on both sides, and I hope that our G-8 colleagues will support us. We will find common ground on this front in order to bring the situation, as soon as possible, to a position where concrete results could be achieved, not only in terms of the cessation of combat but also in terms of building an enabling environment for the development of Israel within secure borders, in the context of security, as well as in terms of the building of the independent Palestine state./Nuclear Proliferation",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a concrete answer about *what actions President Bush and President Putin can take* to halt the violence in the Middle East, especially given allied disagreements over Israel’s use of force.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response talks generally about:
   - The origins of the violence (Hizballah rocket attacks, captured soldiers).
   - Calling on Syria to pressure Hizballah.
   - The broader goal of a two‑state solution and support for democracy.
   - The need for balanced use of force and an end to bloodshed.
   
   However, it never explicitly states *what Bush or Putin specifically should do* (e.g., diplomatic pressure, sanctions, joint statements, etc.). The answer stays at a high‑level, indirect description of the situation and of “the best way to stop the violence,” without tying those points to concrete steps for the two named leaders.

3. **Information type** – The response provides **partial, implicit, and somewhat evasive** information. It touches on related themes but does not deliver the targeted, explicit prescription the question demands. It is therefore **incomplete** with respect to the requested answer.

It's one thing for somebody to say to the President, sure, we're for a two state, just to make the President feel okay. That's not the case here. The fundamental questions that I was seeking at Annapolis and on my return trip is the understanding about the power of what a vision will do for peace.You know, one of the concerns I had was that, whether it be the unprovoked rocket attacks or the issues of settlement, that the leaders would be so bogged down in the moment that they would lose sight of the potential for a historic agreement. And I've come away with the belief that while those issues are important and certainly create consternation amongst the respective constituencies, that both leaders are determined to make the hard choices necessary.Now, implicit in your question is whether or not the President should butt in and actually dictate the end result of the agreement. In my judgment, that would cause there to be a nonlasting agreement. In my judgment, the only way for there to be a vision that means something is for the parties to seriously negotiate that vision. If you're asking me, am I nudging them forward, well, my trip was a pretty significant nudge, because yesterday they had a meeting.And by the way, the atmosphere in America was, nothing is going to happen, see; that these issues are too big on the ground. Therefore, you two can't get together and come up with any agreements. You just heard the man talk about their desire to deal with core issues, which, I guess for the uneducated on the issue, that means dealing with the issues like territory and right of return and Jerusalem. Those are tough issues—the issue of Israeli security. And they're going to sit down at the table and discuss those issues in seriousness.And I've been briefed today from the Israeli perspective of those discussions. Tomorrow I'll be briefed by the Palestinians about their interpretation.Now, there's three tracks going on, by the way, during this process. One is the vision track. Let me just make sure everybody understands—in our delegation—the goal. The goal is for there to be a clear vision of what a state would look like so that, for example, reasonable Palestinian leadership can say, here's your choice: You can have the vision of Hamas, which is dangerous and will lead to war and violence, or you can have the vision of a state, which should be hopeful.The second track is to help both parties deal with roadmap issues. Settlements is a roadmap issue; security is a roadmap issue, in a certain limited sense. Third issue is to help the Palestinians, one, organize their security forces so that they can better assure their own people and, equally importantly, better assure Israel that they can deal with the extremists in their midst. That's what General Dayton is doing here, for example. Or an economic track—listen, the best way to make sure that the Palestinians realize there's a hopeful future in which it's in their interests to live at peace with Israel is for them to realize that they've got an economy in which they can make a living. And Tony Blair is helpful on that, and so is America.And so you're watching three tracks parallel each other. And the one, of course, you're asking about is whether or not the leadership has got the willingness and the desire and the drive to design a state, compatible to both sides. And my answer is, yes, I think they will. I hope that I don't disappoint anyone—certainly not the President, because we talked at length— if I will say that the President didn't ask for me to make any commitments other than the ones that Israel made already with regard to the peace process and as I have spelled it out on many different occasions, including in Annapolis, which was a very, as I said, a very important event. The commitment of Israel is absolutely to carry on in this process in order to realize the vision of two states living side by side, as I said before.Now, there are many issues. Settlement is one of the issues. We made clear our position. And I know that sometimes not everyone is happy with this position, but we are very sincere. And we were never trying to conceal any of these facts from anyone, starting with President Bush and Secretary Rice and, of course, our Palestinian partners.They know that there is a moratorium on new settlements and the new expropriation of land in the Territories. But they also know, and we have made it clear, that Jerusalem, as far as we are concerned, is not in the same status. And they know that the population centers are not in the same status. And there might be things that will happen in the population centers or in Jerusalem which they may not be in love with, but we will discuss them, and we will not hide them. We are not going to build any new settlements or expropriate land in the Territories. We made it clear, and we will stand by our commitments. And we will fulfill all our commitments as part of the roadmap because this is an essential part for any progress that will have to take place in the future.But there are some aspects only just realized which one can't ignore, and everyone knows that certain things in Jerusalem are not in the same tactical level as they are in other parts of the Territories which are outside the city of Jerusalem. And so it's true about some population centers. So there was nothing that happened that was not known in advance to all our partners in this process. We made clear our positions. We made clear exactly what we can do, what we can't do, what we want to do, and what we will not be able to do. And I think that they all know it, and they—at least even when sometimes they disagree with us, they at least respect our sincerity and openness about these issues.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking the interviewee (the Prime Minister) whether, in the course of the conversation, they **offered any new assurances to the President**—specifically, whether they pledged (or intend to pledge) that Israel will **stop disputed settlement and construction activity**. The request is for a clear, direct answer: *yes* (they did/plan to) or *no* (they did not).

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response is a broad, abstract discourse about “mindset,” “vision,” and “the power of a vision for peace.” It mentions that leaders are “determined to make the hard choices necessary” and that “the atmosphere in America… nothing is going to happen,” but it never:
   - States whether any **new assurances** were given,
   - Mentions any **specific pledge** to halt settlements,
   - Indicates any **future plan** to do so.

   Instead, the speaker shifts the focus to general themes of vision and negotiation, leaving the concrete question unanswered.

3. **Information type** – The answer provides **only implicit, generalized commentary** and does not deliver the explicit, targeted information requested. It is neither a straightforward “yes” nor a straightforward “no,” nor does it decline to answer outright; it simply **fails to address the specific assurance question**.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The response **deflects** by moving to a discussion of broader diplomatic strategy rather than answering the direct query about settlement‑freeze assurances.

5. **Classification decision** – Because the answer is **incomplete, indirect, and does not clearly state the requested information**, it fits the definition of an **Ambivalent** response: the information is given in an incomplete, implicit, and deflecting manner.

**LABEL: Ambivalent**","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to that specific question.

257,Contrast the impact on the economy if Republicans retain control of Congress versus what happens if Democrats take over.,"Q. Thank you, sir. Polls show that many people are still more focused on domestic issues like the economy than on the international issues in deciding how to vote in November. And I'd just like to ask you if you could contrast what you think will happen on the economy if Republicans retain control of Congress versus what happens on the economy if Democrats take over?","If I weren't here—first of all, I don't believe the Democrats are going to take over, because our record on the economy is strong. If the American people would take a step back and realize how effective our policies have been, given the circumstances, they will continue to embrace our philosophy of government. We've overcome recession, attacks, hurricanes, scandals, and the economy is growing, 4.7 percent unemployment rate. It's been a strong economy. And I've strongly believed the reason it is because we cut taxes and, at the same time, showed fiscal responsibility here in Washington, with the people's money. That's why the deficit could be cut in half by 2009 or before.And so I shouldn't answer your hypothetical, but I will. I believe if the Democrats had the capacity to, they would raise taxes on the working people. That's what I believe. They'll call it tax on the rich, but that's not the way it works in Washington, see. For example, running up the top income tax bracket would tax small businesses. A lot of small businesses are subchapter S corporations or limited partnerships that pay tax at the individual level. And if you raise income taxes on them, you hurt job creation. Our answer to economic growth is to make the tax cuts permanent so there's certainty in the Tax Code and people have got money to spend in their pockets.And so yes, I've always felt the economy is a determinate issue, if not the determinate issue in campaigns. We've had a little history of that in our family and— []—you might remember. But it's a—I certainly hope this election is based upon economic performance.Let's see here, kind of working my way— yes, Mark [Mark Silva, Chicago Tribune].",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct comparison of two hypothetical outcomes:  
   *If Republicans keep control of Congress* → what will happen to the economy?  
   *If Democrats take control* → what will happen to the economy?  
   The answer should explicitly contrast the two scenarios.

2. **What the interviewee says** – The response talks about:
   - Confidence that Democrats won’t take over.  
   - Praise for Democratic economic policies and a strong economy.  
   - A claim that “if the Democrats had the capacity to, they would raise taxes on the working people.”  
   - A discussion of tax cuts, fiscal responsibility, and job creation.  

   However, the answer never lays out a clear, side‑by‑side contrast of the two possible congressional outcomes. It drifts into general political commentary, makes assertions about Democratic tax plans, and ends with a non‑sequitur (“Let’s see here, kind of working my way— yes, Mark …”).

3. **Does the answer give the requested information?**  
   - **Explicit contrast?** No.  
   - **Clear statement of what would happen under each scenario?** No.  
   - **Only partial or implicit information?** Yes – the speaker mentions that Democrats might raise taxes, which implies a negative economic effect, but does not spell out what would happen if Republicans stay in control, nor does it systematically compare the two.

4. **Which classification fits?**  
   - **Clear Reply** – requires the information to be explicitly stated in the requested form. The answer does **not** meet this.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – would apply if the respondent gave *no* relevant information at all (e.g., “I don’t know”). The respondent does provide some related remarks, so this is not a total non‑reply.  
   - **Ambivalent** – fits when the answer is incomplete, partial, or indirect. The response offers only vague, indirect remarks about Democratic tax policy and does not deliver a full contrast, making it an incomplete answer to the question.

**Conclusion:** The interviewee’s reply is incomplete and indirect; it does not clearly contrast the two scenarios but merely hints at one side of the comparison. Therefore, it falls under the **Ambivalent** category.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is requesting a substantive comment on a reported judicial repudiation of the administration’s post‑9/11 terror‑suspect policy. The expected answer would be an assessment, explanation, or judgment about that judicial action.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does **not** provide any assessment or explanation. Instead, they repeatedly state that they “haven’t been briefed enough to make a comment,” that they “can’t comment,” and that they will “conform to the Supreme Court” and “work with” Congress. The response ends with a refusal to answer further.

3. **Information type** – The requested comment is **absent**. The speaker does not give any evaluation of the judicial repudiation; they merely explain why they are unable to comment.

4. **Evasion vs. non‑reply** – This is not a vague or partially‑addressed answer (which would be “ambivalent”). It is a straightforward refusal to answer, citing lack of briefing.

259," Is the goalpost moving, sir?","Q. We're a friendly paper too. [Laughter]Mr. President, you've often used the phrase stand up/stand down, to describe your policy when it comes to troop withdrawals from Iraq—as Iraqi troops are trained and take over the fight, American troops will come home. The Pentagon now says they've trained 294,000 Iraqi troops and expect to complete their program of training 325,000 by the end of the year. But American troops aren't coming home, and there are more there now than there were previously. Is the goalpost moving, sir?","No, no. The enemy is changing tactics, and we're adapting. That's what's happening. And I asked General Casey today, Have you got what you need? He said, Yes, I've got what I need.We all want the troops to come home as quickly as possible. But they'll be coming home when our commanders say the Iraqi Government is capable of defending itself and sustaining itself and is governing itself. And you know, I was hoping we would have—be able to—hopefully, Casey would come and say, you know, Mr. President, there's a chance to have fewer troops there. It looked like that might be the case, until the violence started rising in Baghdad, and it spiked in June and July, as you know—or increased in June and July.And so they've got a plan now. They've adapted. The enemy moved; we'll help the Iraqis move. And so they're building a berm around the city to make it harder for people to come in with explosive devices, for example. They're working different neighborhoods inside of Baghdad to collect guns and bring people to detention. They've got a clear, build, and hold strategy.The reason why there are not fewer troops there, but are more—you're right; it's gone from 135,000 to about 147,000, I think, or 140-something thousand troops—is because George Casey felt he needed them to help the Iraqis achieve their objective.And that's the way I will continue to conduct the war. I'll listen to generals. Maybe it's not the politically expedient thing to do, is to increase troops coming into an election, but we just can't—you can't make decisions based upon politics about how to win a war. And the fundamental question you have to ask—and Martha knows what I'm about to say—is, can the President trust his commanders on the ground to tell him what is necessary? That's really one of the questions.In other words, if you say, I'm going to rely upon their judgment, the next question is, how good is their judgment, or is my judgment good enough to figure out whether or not they know what they're doing? And I'm going to tell you, I've got great confidence in General John Abizaid and General George Casey. These are extraordinary men who understand the difficulties of the task and understand there is a delicate relationship between self-sufficiency on the Iraqis' part and U.S. presence.And this is not a science but an art form in a way, to try to make sure that a unity government is able to defend itself and, at the same time, not be totally reliant upon coalition forces to do the job for them. And the issue is complicated by the fact that there are still Al Qaida or Saddam remnants or militias that are still violent. And so to answer your question, the policy still holds. The stand up/stand down still holds, and so does the policy of me listening to our commanders to give me the judgment necessary for troop levels.Richard [Richard Wolffe, Newsweek] and then Allen [Mike Allen, Time].",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is directly asking whether the criteria for withdrawing U.S. troops (“the goalpost”) are being shifted, i.e., whether the administration is changing its stated conditions for pulling out forces.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not give a simple “yes” or “no.” Instead, he:
   - Reframes the issue in terms of enemy tactics and adaptation.
   - Describes troop numbers and the role of commanders.
   - Explains the logic behind keeping more troops.
   - Shifts the focus to broader strategic considerations rather than confirming or denying that the goalpost has moved.

3. **Information provided** – The response is **partial and indirect**. It touches on related themes (enemy behavior, commander judgment, troop levels) but never explicitly states whether the goalpost is being moved. The answer is therefore **incomplete** with respect to the specific question.

4. **Evasion vs. clarity** – Because the answer does not outright refuse to answer, it is not a *Clear Non‑Reply*. It also does not give the explicit, straightforward answer the question requests, so it is not a *Clear Reply*. The response is best characterized as **dodging/deflecting** while offering related context.

**Conclusion:** The interviewee’s reply is incomplete and indirect, addressing the underlying concerns without directly answering the question. This fits the definition of an **Ambivalent** response.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct answer to the factual query: *“Did you vote in the Texas primary?”*  
   The expected response is a simple “Yes” or “No” (or an equivalent affirmative/negative statement).

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee says:  
   *“I did, and I'm not telling you who.”*  
   - The phrase **“I did”** directly confirms that they **did vote** in the Texas primary.  
   - The additional comment about not revealing *who* they voted for does not obscure the affirmative answer to the asked question; it merely adds extra information.

3. **Does the answer provide the requested information explicitly?** – Yes. The required information (“Did you vote…?”) is answered explicitly with an affirmative statement. The extra clause does not make the answer vague or incomplete regarding the core question.

4. **Is there any evasion, ignorance, or deflection?** – No. The interviewee does not refuse to answer, claim ignorance, or give a non‑answer. They simply answer the question and then add a separate remark.

How do you feel about a lot of the foreign-owned companies buying out U.S. tech companies, especially those that have military contracts?","We have laws that prevent sensitive technologies from being transferred as a result of sale and/or merger. And we watch that very carefully.On the broader scale, I have no problem with foreign capital buying U.S. companies; nor do I have a problem with U.S. companies buying foreign companies. That's what free trade is all about. As a matter of fact, there are workers working here in Illinois because of foreign investment. A foreign company takes a look at Illinois, they like the tax structure, they like the governance, they like the workforce, and they invest. And when they invest, they create jobs.A lot of the jobs in America exist as a result of foreign companies investing here in our country. So I believe in opening markets. I do believe in protecting secrets, but we've got laws on the books to prevent secrets from being transferred or vital technology from being transferred. But I believe in free flows of capital, and I believe in free trade. And that's not a given in the United States. There are people who say, Well, we can't compete with China; let's throw up roadblocks; let's protect ourselves, or, We don't want foreigners coming to invest in our country. I think that would be a mistake. I think that's the early signs of protectionist sentiments, which would mean our economy wouldn't grow.In my State of the Union—the very same State of the Union that I addressed the energy problem—I talked about trends that are worrisome. One trend would be protectionism, and its corollary would be isolationism. An isolationist world basically says, Don't worry about what happens overseas; we'll just worry about what happens here at home. Don't worry about HIV/AIDS on the continent of Africa, not our problem. Don't worry about Darfur, it's not our problem. Don't worry about the fact that there's tyrannies in the Middle East; that's not our problem.The truth of the matter is, all of these issues are our problem, and if we became isolationist, we would not do our duty to protect the American people and, kind of, lay the foundations for a better world.People say, well, you know, China is too tough to compete with; let's just throw up tariffs.

262,At what point do you feel that you declare stalemate to try and reach common ground?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. The world leaders here have stressed growth, the importance of growth. And yet growth back at home has been anemic, the new jobs report today showing just 88,000 jobs added. The Republicans in Congress have made it clear that they're going to block your jobs bill because they believe the tax hikes in it hurt small businesses. At what point do you feel that you declare stalemate to try and reach common ground? And do you feel like you have been an effective leader when it comes to the economy?","Well, first of all, wherever Republicans indicate an interest in doing things that would actually grow the economy, I'm right there with them. So they've said that passing trade bills with South Korea and Panama and Colombia would help spur growth. Those got done, with significant bipartisan support. They've suggested that we need to reform our patent laws. That's something that was part of my long-term program for economic growth; we've got that done. What I've said is all those things are nice and they're important, but if we want to grow the economy right now then we have to think bigger; we've got to do something bolder and more significant.So we put forward the American Jobs Act, which contains ideas that are historically supported by Democrats and Republicans, like rebuilding our infrastructure, our roads, and our bridges, putting teachers back in the classroom, providing tax credits to small businesses.You say, Norah, that the reason they haven't voted for them is because they don't want to tax small business. Well, actually, that's not--if that's their rationale then it doesn't fly, because the bill that they voted down yesterday, a component of the American jobs bill, essentially said we can create hundreds of thousands of jobs rebuilding our infrastructure, making America more competitive, and the entire program will be paid for by a tax not on millionaires, but people making a million dollars a year or more, which in the United States is about--a little over 300,000 people.Now, there aren't a lot of small businesses across the country that are making that kind of money. In fact, less than 3 percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year. So what they've said is, we prefer to protect 300,000 people rather than put hundreds of thousands of people back to work and benefit 300 million Americans who are hurting because of low growth.So we're going to keep on pushing. Now, there are steps that we can take absent congressional action. And the refinancing proposal that we put forward in Las Vegas is an example of that--helping students with student loans. We're going to keep on rolling out administrative steps that we can take that strengthen the economy. But if we're going to do something big to jump-start the economy at a time when it's stabilized, but unemployment is way too high, Congress is going to need to act.And in terms of my track record on the economy, here's just a simple way of thinking about it: When I came into office, the U.S. economy had contracted by 9 percent, the largest contraction since the Great Depression. Little over a year later, the economy was growing by 4 percent, and it's been growing ever since.Now, is that good enough? Absolutely not. We've got to do more. And as soon as I get some signal from Congress that they're willing to take their responsibilities seriously, I think we can do more. But that's going to require them to break out of the rigid ideological positions that they've been taking. And the same is true, by the way, when it comes to deficit reduction.We can solve all our problems. We can grow our economy now, put people back to work, reduce our deficit. And you get surprising consensus from economists about how to do it, from both the left and the right. It's just a matter of setting politics aside. And we're constantly remembering that the election is 1 year away. If we do that, there's no reason why can't solve these problems.All right.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a clear indication of the President’s personal threshold: *when* he would decide to declare a stalemate in trying to reach common ground with Congress on economic policy.

2. **What the answer does** – The response talks about bipartisan trade bills, patent‑law reform, the American Jobs Act, and the political calculus around taxing high‑income earners. It never states a specific point, condition, or threshold at which a stalemate would be declared. Instead, it shifts the focus to defending the administration’s record and attacking congressional opposition.

3. **Nature of the response** – The answer is **not a direct, explicit statement** of when a stalemate would be declared. It is **partial and indirect**, offering related political context but avoiding the core query. This matches the definition of an *ambivalent* reply: the information is given in an incomplete, implicit, or deflecting way.

4. **Classification choice** – Because the response does not outright refuse to answer (it does not constitute a “Clear Non‑Reply”) and it does not fully satisfy the request for a clear, explicit answer, it falls into the **Ambivalent** category.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a concrete explanation of *how* the U.S. national ballistic‑missile defense system would have intercepted a North Korean missile **if** it had been aimed at the United States.

2. **What the answer provides** –  
   - The speaker repeats that they “still can’t give you any better answer than yesterday.”  
   - They note they have not spoken to the Secretary of Defense about it.  
   - They describe U.S. missile systems as “modest,” “new research,” and that testing is ongoing.  
   - They say it is “hard for me to give you a probability of success.”  
   - They shift to a broader point about the need for a ballistic‑missile system because of “nontransparent societies” launching rockets.  
   - The response ends with “Obviously, it wasn’t a satisfactory answer.”

3. **Does the answer directly address the request?** – No. It never explains *how* the defense system would have taken the missile down; it only offers vague, generic statements about the capabilities and research status of those systems and deflects to unrelated commentary.

4. **Is the information given at all?** – Some related remarks are offered (e.g., that the systems are “modest” and still under development), but they are insufficient to answer the specific hypothetical scenario. The response is therefore incomplete and evasive rather than a straightforward refusal or a clear, factual answer.

5. **Classification decision** – Because the answer provides **partial, implicit, and deflecting** information without delivering a clear, complete response to the specific question, it fits the **Ambivalent** category.

And I will protect the people and, at the same time, conform with the findings of the Supreme Court.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks**  
   - The interviewer wants a clear answer about (a) whether the speaker intends to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility quickly, and (b) how they will handle detainees deemed “too dangerous to be released or sent home.”

2. **How the answer addresses it**  
   - The response talks about a recent Supreme Court ruling, says the speaker “hasn't had a chance to fully review the findings,” and that they will “seriously look at the findings.”  
   - It then shifts to general statements about safety, working with Congress, and protecting the American people.  
   - It never explicitly says **whether** the facility will be closed quickly, nor does it outline a concrete plan for handling the especially dangerous detainees.

3. **Information type**  
   - The answer provides only vague, general remarks and deflects the specific request for a definitive plan or timeline.  
   - It is not a complete refusal to answer (there is some commentary), but the information given is **incomplete and indirect**.

4. **Evasion / deflection**  
   - The speaker avoids committing to a timeline (“I haven’t had a chance to fully review…”) and instead offers broad assurances about safety and congressional collaboration, which does not directly answer the question.

**Conclusion**  
The response is **not a clear reply** (it does not explicitly answer the question) and it is **not a total non‑reply** (some related commentary is offered). Instead, it gives a **partial, implicit, and deflecting answer**, fitting the definition of an **Ambivalent** response.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct judgment on whether a specific assumption about CIA operatives in Pakistan (their presence, cooperation with Pakistani authorities, and mutual sharing of information) is fair.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does **not** evaluate the fairness of that assumption. Instead, they state a general rule: *“I’m not going to talk about ongoing intelligence matters.”* This is a refusal to discuss the topic, not an answer to the question.

3. **Information type** – The requested information (a yes/no or assessment of fairness) is **absent**. The response provides no explicit statement about the assumption’s validity; it merely declines to comment.

4. **Evasion check** – The reply is a classic non‑answer: it sidesteps the substantive query by invoking a blanket restriction on discussing ongoing intelligence matters.

And also, if you wouldn't mind, what is the redline for North Korea, given what has happened over the past few months?","My point was, bilateral negotiations didn't work. I appreciate the efforts of previous administrations. It just didn't work. And therefore, I thought it was important to change how we approached the problem so that we could solve it diplomatically. And I firmly believe that with North Korea and with Iran that it is best to deal with these regimes with more than one voice, because I understand how it works. What ends up happening is, is that we say to a country such as North Korea, Here's a reasonable way forward. They try to extract more at the negotiating table, or they've got a different objective, and then they go and say, Wait a minute; the United States is being unreasonable. They make a threat. They could—they say the world is about to fall apart because of the United States problem. And all of a sudden, we become the issue.But the United States message to North Korea and Iran and the people in both countries is that we have—we want to solve issues peacefully. We said there's a better way forward for you. Here's a chance, for example, to help your country economically. And all you got to do is verifiably show that you—in Iran's case, that you suspended your weapons program, and in North Korea's case, that you've got international safeguards on your program— which they agreed to, by the way.And so my point is, is that—to the American people I say, Look, we want to solve this diplomatically. It's important for the President to say to the American people, diplomacy was what—is our first choice and that I've now outlined a strategy. And I think it is a hopeful sign that China is now a integral partner in helping North Korea understand that it's just not the United States speaking to them.And it's an important sign to North Korea that South Korea, a country which obviously is deeply concerned about North Korean activities—South Korea is a partner, and that if North Korea decides that they don't like what's being said, they're not just stiffing the United States—I don't know if that's a diplomatic word or not—but they're sending a message to countries in the neighborhood that they really don't care what other countries think, which leads to further isolation.

1. **What the question asks:**  
   The interviewer wants a clear definition of the “redline” for North Korea – i.e., the specific threshold or condition that would trigger a U.S. response given recent developments.

2. **How the answer addresses it:**  
   - The response discusses broader policy points (bilateral negotiations, multilateral approaches, economic incentives, UN resolutions, etc.).  
   - It never isolates or states a concrete “redline” for North Korea.  
   - The answer is vague, general, and shifts the focus to diplomatic strategy rather than providing the requested specific threshold.

3. **Information type:**  
   - The answer is **incomplete** and **implicit**; it hints at the importance of diplomatic solutions and international cooperation but does not articulate a clear redline.  
   - This fits the description of a **partial/deflective** response.

4. **Evasion or deflection?**  
   - Yes. The speaker sidesteps the direct request by talking about general policy rather than naming a redline. This is a classic case of deflection.

5. **Category selection:**  
   - **Clear Reply** – not applicable; the answer does not explicitly state the redline.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – not applicable; the respondent does provide some related commentary, even if it does not answer the question.  
   - **Ambivalent** – appropriate, because the information is given but only in an incomplete, indirect, and somewhat evasive manner.

267, Is a no-fly zone under consideration as an option?,Q. And a no-fly zone is one of those options still under consideration?,"That is one of the options that we would be looking at. First, in terms of Libya, I recognize and applaud the efforts undertaken by President Obama, as I said previously, to seek a solution in line with international law for this situation. For Mexico, it's absolutely clear that we cannot--it's not possible that civilians be massacred and not go punished, using weapons that are for the exclusive use of war. We must do everything that we can to avoid or stop that massacre.Mexico indeed has presented a resolution within the framework of the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations. And in this Libya has been sanctioned by the Commission. And we are of course taking part, insofar as we are able to, in the search for a solution to this problem.I believe that today it is--problem to revalue the principles and the values of human rights anywhere in the world--the principles and values that we recognize and value. We have them in North American society and people, in terms of that we condemn any act of violence against people where people are risking their lives, in terms of the use of weapons.We condemn any act of violence against these people, and we believe that people must have the best conditions to guarantee their work, including their personal security. And in this effort I know that we have the support of different agencies of the Government of the United States who have contributed enormously to the solution of the problems that we are facing together under the principle of shared responsibility that we are consolidating.I must nonetheless clarify that there are very important legal restrictions in this matter in Mexico, as is probably the case in other countries, and most likely the United States, with respect to the actions of foreign agents in Mexican land. The law does not allow agents of the United States or of any other country to take part in tasks involving justice enforcement in our territory. As a result, they cannot carry weapons or undertake operational tasks. Their functions, in line with our treaties, are limited to the exchange of information and technical assistance to support Mexican authorities in these tasks. So there's an important legal restriction that exists.But it's very clear for me as well that we must find the way of enhancing the level of protection of any and all agents who are acting within the framework of the law against crime. And of course, we are deeply analyzing alternatives for this and in dialogue with the Mexican Congress, who is the party that has the final word--the final say on this matter.And finally, on the issue of football, I'm not an expert; my wife is, though. And I will ask her about it. I'm sure that she's very concerned about the situation. But allow me to say that football is very important for many Mexicans.So for that, whatever you need, with the exception of money, you can count on us. [] But fix that, please. I will say that at the state dinner, the First Lady of Mexico seemed quite excited to see Mark Sanchez there. Yes. I don't know if that was of concern to you. [] No. It's okay.

Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister, why should one expect this new security crackdown in Baghdad to succeed when all previous ones have failed?And, Mr. President, you've said before that withdrawal of U.S. troops would depend on conditions on the ground. What do conditions on the ground now in Baghdad suggest in terms of whether there can be a significant withdrawal of American forces by the end of the year?","I'll start—do you want to start? Go ahead. Actually, the circumstances that the Baghdad security plans, or other plans related to Basra and other places, are different in terms of circumstances from the previous plans. Today, Iraq has a national unity Government that—it is basically composed of—all elements of the Iraqi people are represented in this Government. Iraq has a parliament; it has a Constitution to face all these challenges. So what the Baghdad security plan gains, in terms of support, is support from all over the segments of the Iraqi population.Secondly, by monitoring the reality on the ground, we will be able to ensure the success, especially what happens against the innocent people. The Baghdad security forces was able to eliminate many hotspots of crimes and troubles in Baghdad. One of the things that's important is for—and one of the reasons why you trust the commanders on the ground is because there needs to be flexibility. And I explained to the Prime Minister that I'll be making my decisions based upon the recommendations of General Casey. And obviously, the violence in Baghdad is still terrible, and therefore, there needs to be more troops. In other words, the commanders said, What more can we do; how best to address the conditions on the ground? And they have recommended, as a result of working with the Prime Minister, based upon his recommendation, that we increase the number of U.S. troops in Baghdad alongside of Iraqi troops. And we're going to do that.The second request that the Prime Minister made was that he needs more equipment for his troops. And General Dempsey, along with General Casey, have reviewed his requests and his ideas. And I told the Prime Minister if this is what these generals recommend, it's what I support.Conditions change inside a country, Tom. And the question is, are we going to be facile enough to change with—will we be nimble enough; will we be able to deal with the circumstances on the ground?

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants to know *why* one should expect the new Baghdad security crackdown to succeed where earlier efforts failed. In other words, the answer should spell out the expectations or conditions that make success plausible.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee directly answers by outlining several concrete reasons:
   - The current security plan operates under a *different set of circumstances* (a national unity government representing all Iraqi groups).
   - The plan enjoys *broad-based support* from across Iraqi society.
   - Iraqi and U.S. forces have already *eliminated many crime hotspots* and are *monitoring the ground reality*.
   - Success depends on *flexibility* and *the recommendations of senior commanders* (General Casey, General Dempsey), which the speaker endorses.
   - The United States will *increase troop numbers* and provide *additional equipment* to Iraqi forces.
   - The speaker concludes that the United States *will be able to adapt* to conditions on the ground, implying confidence in success.

   These points constitute an explicit articulation of the expectations for success.

3. **Is the information explicit?** – Yes. The response spells out the specific conditions and rationales that are supposed to make the crackdown succeed. It does not merely hint or remain vague; it lists concrete factors (unity government, popular support, elimination of hotspots, commander recommendations, additional resources, adaptability).

4. **Is there evasion or incompleteness?** – No. The answer does not dodge the question, nor does it refuse to answer. It provides a substantive, detailed justification rather than a non‑answer or a merely general statement.

5. **Conclusion** – Because the requested information (the expectations of success for the new security crackdown) is explicitly stated and fully addressed, the response falls under **Clear Reply**.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct answer to whether the interlocutors *discussed* the possibility of referring the North‑Korea missile issue to the U.N. Security Council.

2. **What the answer contains** –  
   - The speaker mentions that “the U.N. is an opportunity to express our common concern.”  
   - They also say “we discussed that,” but they do **not** specify what was discussed.  
   - No explicit statement such as “Yes, we talked about referring the matter to the U.N. Security Council” or “No, we did not discuss that” is given.  
   - The response is vague, shifts to other topics (missile defenses, general cooperation), and ends with a broader statement about choices and responsibilities.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – The answer does **not** explicitly state whether the discussion took place; it is not a direct, unambiguous answer.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – The answer does provide some reference to the U.N., so it is not a complete refusal or ignorance; it does give a fragment of information.

270, How would you characterize the relationship between the United States and the United Nations at this point?,"Q. Mr. President, as you prepare to go up to the United Nations next week to address the General Assembly, Secretary Kofi Annan has been critical of some of U.S. policies, particularly in Afghanistan, lately. How would you characterize the relationship between the United States and the United Nations at this point?","Yes. First of all, my personal relationship with Kofi Annan is good. I like him. And we've got a good relationship, personal relationship. I think a lot of Americans are frustrated with the , to be frank with you. Take, for example, Darfur—I'm frustrated with the in regards to Darfur. I have said and this Government has said, there's genocide taking place in the Sudan. And it breaks our collective hearts to know that.We believe that the best way to solve the problem is there be a political track as well as a security track. And part of the security track was for there initially to be African Union forces supported by the international community, hopefully to protect innocent lives from militia. And the AU force is there, but it needs—it's not robust enough. It needs to be bigger. It needs to be more viable.And so the strategy was then to go to the and pass a resolution enabling the AU force to become blue-helmeted—that means, become a peacekeeping force—with additional support from around the world. And I suggested that there also be help from NATO nations in logistics and support in order to make the security effective enough so that a political process could go forward to save lives.The problem is, is that the hasn't acted. And so I can understand why those who are concerned about Darfur are frustrated; I am. I'd like to see more robust action. What you'll hear is, Well, the Government of Sudan must invite the in for us to act. Well, there are other alternatives, like passing a resolution saying, we're coming in with a U.N. force in order to save lives.I'm proud of our country's support for those who suffer. We've provided, by far, the vast majority of food and aid. I'm troubled by reports I hear about escalating violence. I can understand the desperation people feel for women being pulled out of these refugee centers and raped. And now is the time for the U.N. to act.So you asked if there are levels of frustration; there's a particular level of frustration. I also believe that the can do a better job spending the taxpayer— our taxpayers' money. I think there needs to be better management structures in place, better accountability in the organization. I hope the still strongly stands for liberty. I hope they would support my call to end tyranny in the 21st century.So I'm looking forward to going up there to—it's always an interesting experience, Richard, for a west Texas fellow to speak to the . And I'm going to have a strong message, one that's hope— based upon hope and my belief that the civilized world must stand with moderate reformist-minded people and help them realize their dreams. I believe that's the call of the 21st century.Let's see, who else? The front row people have all asked. Hutch [Ron Hutcheson, Knight Ridder].",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a clear characterisation of the current U.S.–UN relationship (e.g., “strained but cooperative,” “generally positive,” “hostile,” etc.).

2. **How the answer addresses it** –  
   - The interviewee mentions that his *personal* relationship with Kofi Annan is good, which is only a small part of the overall relationship.  
   - He then shifts to expressing frustration with the UN’s inaction on Darfur, calls for a more robust UN force, and criticises UN management and spending.  
   - He also adds broader statements about the UN’s role, the need for action, and hopes for U.N. support.  
   - The response is a mixture of positive, negative, and aspirational remarks, but it never isolates a single, explicit assessment of the overall relationship.

3. **Information type** – The answer provides **partial, implicit, and scattered information** rather than a concise, explicit characterisation. It touches on several facets (personal rapport, frustration, desired UN actions, management concerns) but does not deliver a straightforward judgment such as “the relationship is strained” or “the relationship is cooperative.”

4. **Evasion / deflection** – The speaker does not refuse to answer; instead, he **deflects** by expanding the discussion to many related issues and by offering a series of related but not directly answering statements. This is characteristic of an **ambivalent** response.

**Conclusion:** The response partially addresses the question but does so in an incomplete, indirect, and multifaceted way, fitting the definition of an *Ambivalent* answer.

271,Does he pose any particular unique problems to deal with?,"Q. Does he pose—come to the booth, sir, I'll tell you who it was. [Laughter] Does he pose any particular unique problems to deal with? And do you feel that he's looking, for instance, at what's been offered to the Iranians by the world community in terms of incentives and saying, I'd like a little of that for myself?","It's hard for me to tell you what's on his mind. He lives in a very closed society. It's unlike our societies where we have press conferences and people are entitled to ask questions, and there's all kinds of discussions out of administrations and people saying this, saying that, and the other. This is a very closed society.We do know there's a lot of concentration camps. We do know that people are starving. As a matter of fact, our Nation has tried to help feed the hungry. But what we don't know is his intentions, and so I think we've got to plan for the worst and hope for the best. And planning for the worst means to make sure that we continue to work with friends and allies, as well as those who've agreed to be a part of the six-party talks, to continue to send a unified message.We've also got a very strong Proliferation Security Initiative, because one of the threats that can emanate from a closed society, particularly one that claims to have nuclear weapons, is proliferation. One of the real dangers we face is weapons of mass destruction in the hands of people who would like to continue to hurt us, hurt the United States or hurt Canada, hurt anybody who has the courage to stand up and embrace freedom, see. That's the big threat.And so we don't know, Jim, about his intentions, but we take—we're planning. And so one of the things we've done— and I thank Canada's contribution—is for there to be a very strong initiative to prevent proliferation, through what we call the Proliferation Security Initiative. And it's an important initiative. It's a way to say, we're not going to allow you to threaten us; we're not going to allow you to—the rocket— as I say, I'm not exactly sure what the azimuth was of the rocket. We've got our people still analyzing that. But, for example, we didn't—we don't know what was on the rocket. We don't know where the rocket was headed. It would have been helpful, of course, had he said, Here's what we're going to do. Here's our intentions. Here's what—we want to work with you; we want to explain it. Who knows—maybe send a satellite—who knows what his intention was.But that's not the way he decided to deal with it. He just decided to say—to start firing, and he fired seven of them. And we take this seriously. We take, and we all should take, threats seriously. That's one of the lessons of September the 11th, is that what takes place in other parts of the world can come home to hurt the American people. See, a failed government in Afghanistan enabled plotters and planners to train and then come and kill 3,000 of our citizens. And so it used to be that's it's okay if something were happening from afar, oceans could protect us. I presume that's how some in Canada used to feel. The lesson of September the 11th is, is that we're vulnerable, and therefore, we've got to deal with each threat.I've assured the American people and assured our friends and allies, we want to deal with threats diplomatically. The best way to deal with threats diplomatically is to encourage others to be a part of the process. And that's what we're doing. That's why we've got the six-party talks.And one of the keys in the six-party talks is for all the nations to send clear messages to Kim Jong Il. That's why I was on the phone this morning, saying as clearly as I could to our fellow partners, four other leaders, to say, let's send a common message that you won't be rewarded for ignoring the world and that you'll be isolated if you continue to do this, and yet there's a way forward.See, I care deeply about the people in . I truly do. It breaks my heart to know that young children are literally starving to death. And I wish—I just wish at some point in time there was an openness in that society where we could help save lives. I'm also realistic enough to realize what weapons of mass destruction could mean in the world in which we live.And so we're working this issue hard. We're working the Iranian issue hard. Steve and I talked about a strategy going into the G-8 session. I talked to President Putin this morning abut making sure that not only do we send messages to the ns but that our strategy will work with Iran.And it's just really important for the American President to see the world the way it is, not the way we would hope it would be, and to deal with threats, and to do so in a way that will achieve results. And it takes a while. I mean, these threats didn't arise overnight, and these problems won't be solved overnight. But we've got strategies in place to deal with them.And one of the reasons why it's important to have Steve here is so we can talk about how we can work together to deal with it. And they're not just threats to our security that normal people think of. HIV/AIDS on the continent of Africa is a threat to our security in the long run. That's why I'm proud to report the United States took the lead on setting up the Global Fund, as well as bilateral programs to help save people's lives. I think it's in our interests. I also happen to believe in the admonition, To whom much is given, much is required.And so we've got a robust foreign policy on a lot of fronts, and I intend to keep it that way. And I'm confident that what we're doing is going to make this world a better place. And I'm proud to have allies like Steve who understand the stakes of the 21st century.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct assessment: *Does the person in question create any particular, unique problems for us to deal with?*  
   The expected answer would be a clear “yes” or “no,” or a concise description of those problems.

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee does not give a straightforward yes/no or a concrete description of unique problems. Instead, the response:
   - Shifts to a general discussion of the person’s closed society and unknown intentions.  
   - Talks about planning for the worst, threats of proliferation, and rocket launches.  
   - Uses vague language (“we don’t know,” “it would have been helpful…”) rather than stating explicitly what unique problems exist.  
   - Ends with a broader warning about threats, without pinpointing any specific problem that the person poses.

3. **Information provided** – The answer is **partial and implicit**. It hints at uncertainty and potential threats, but it never directly answers whether the person *poses* unique problems, nor does it enumerate those problems.

4. **Evasion or deflection?** – Yes. The response deflects from the specific question by moving to a broader geopolitical context and by emphasizing uncertainty rather than providing a clear assessment.

5. **Classification decision** – Because the answer is incomplete, indirect, and does not explicitly state the requested information, it fits the **Ambivalent** category: the information is given but only in a vague, partial, and deflecting manner.

**LABEL: Ambivalent**","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to the specific question: ""Does he pose any particular unique problems to deal with?""

272,Are you concerned that the results of the exit polls may embolden voters from the other party?,"Q. According to some exit polls, sir, about one out of two voters apparently said that they would like to either see it overturned or repealed. Do you--are you concerned that that may embolden voters who are from the other party, perhaps?","Well, it also means one out of two voters think it was the right thing to do. And obviously, this is an issue that has been contentious. But as I said, I think what's going to be useful is for us to go through the issues that Republicans have issues on, not sort of talking generally, but let's talk specifics. Does this particular provision--when it comes to preexisting conditions--is this something you're for or you're against? Helping seniors get their prescription drugs--does that make sense or not?And if we take that approach, which is different from campaigning--I mean, this is now governing--then I think that we can continue to make some progress and find some common ground.Chip Reid [CBS News].",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct answer to a yes/no‑type concern: *Is the speaker worried that the exit‑poll results might embolden voters of the opposite party?* The expected response would be a clear statement of whether that concern exists.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not answer the concern at all. Instead, they:
   - Restate a generic interpretation of the poll (“one out of two voters think it was the right thing to do”).
   - Shift the discussion to “issues that Republicans have issues on,” “specific provisions,” and “pre‑existing conditions.”
   - End with a broader comment about governing and finding common ground.

   The response never says “yes, I am concerned” or “no, I am not concerned.” It merely sidesteps the specific question and talks about other topics.

3. **Information type** – Because the answer does not provide the requested judgment about whether the exit‑poll results might embolden opponents, the requested information is **incomplete and indirect**. It offers related but not answering content (general talk about issues and governance) rather than a direct answer.

4. **Evasion check** – The reply clearly **deflects** from the question. It avoids stating any position on the political impact of the poll, which is exactly what the question seeks.

**Conclusion:** The response is neither a full refusal to answer nor a complete non‑reply; it partially addresses the topic but does so in a vague, indirect, and evasive manner, leaving the core question unanswered.

273,Is it fair for people to ask questions about your commitment to accountability?,"Q. If I could follow—sorry. Given the decision to commute the sentence of Libby and given the performance of Iraqi leaders, is it fair for people to ask questions about your commitment to accountability?","I would hope people would say that I am deliberate in my decisionmaking; I think about all aspects of the decisions I make; and I'm a fair person.And the—back to Iraq, no question, they haven't made as much progress as I would have hoped. But I also recognize how difficult the task is. And I repeat to you: The fundamental question is, does it matter whether or not there is a self-governing entity that's an ally in the war on terror in Iraq? Does it matter? Does it matter to a guy living in Crawford, Texas? Does it matter to your children? As you know from these press conferences, I have come to the conclusion that it does matter. And it does matter because enemies that would like to do harm to the American people would be emboldened by failure.I recognize there's a debate here in America as to whether or not failure in Iraq would cause there to be more danger here in America. I strongly believe that's the case. It matters if the United States does not believe in the universality of freedom. It matters to the security of people here at home if we don't work to change the conditions that caused 19 kids to be lured onto airplanes to come and murder our citizens.The first question one has to ask on Iraq is, is it worth it? I could not send a mother's child into combat if I did not believe it was necessary for our short-term and long-term security to succeed in Iraq. Once you come to the conclusion that it's worth it, then the question you must ask is, how difficult is the task of a young democracy emerging? Those who study the Articles of Confederation would recognize that there are difficult moments in young democracies emerging, particularly after, in this case, tyrannical rule.That's not to say that, Dave, we shouldn't be pushing hard for all opportunities for reconciliation. But for those of us who believe it's worth it, we'll see progress. For those who believe it's not worth it, there is no progress. And that's going to be the interesting debate. And what it's going to come down to is whether or not the United States should be in Iraq and in the region in a position to enable societies to begin to embrace liberty for the long term. This is an ideological struggle.Now, I recognize some don't view it as an ideological struggle, but I firmly believe it is an ideological struggle. And I believe it's a struggle between the forces of moderation and reasonableness and good and the forces of murder and intolerance. And what has made the stakes so high is that those forces of murder and intolerance have shown they have the capacity to murder innocent people in our own country. And so I put that in the context of accountability.In the case of Iraq, it's a lot more complicated than just the passage of four laws, even though I would hope they would get the four laws passed. But again, I repeat the threshold question: Does it matter; does it matter to our security here at home? And the answer is, absolutely, it does. It does. And then the second question really for a lot of Americans is, can we succeed? And, in my mind, the answer to that is, absolutely; not only we must succeed, we can succeed.Listen, thank you all for your time. I appreciate it.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking for a judgment: *Is it fair for people to question the speaker’s commitment to accountability?* The expected answer would be a direct assessment (e.g., “Yes, it is fair,” or “No, it isn’t fair,” possibly with a brief justification).

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The respondent does not give a clear yes/no judgment about the fairness of the questioning. Instead, the reply:
   - Shifts to a broader discussion of “deliberate decision‑making,” “fairness,” and “accountability” in the abstract.

And one of those options, of course, is increasing more troops. But in order to do so, there must be a specific mission that can be accomplished with more troops. And that's precisely what our commanders have said, as well as people who know a lot about military operations. And I agree with them that there's got to be a specific mission that can be accomplished with the addition of more troops before I agree on that strategy.Secondly, whatever we do is going to help the Iraqis step up. It's their responsibility to govern their country. It's their responsibility to do the hard work necessary to secure Baghdad. And we want to help them.Thirdly, I appreciate the fact that the Prime Minister and members of the Government are forming what you have called a moderate coalition, because it's becoming very apparent to the people of Iraq that there are extremists and radicals who are anxious to stop the advance of a free society. And therefore, a moderate coalition signals to the vast majority of the people of Iraq that we have a unity government, that we're willing to reconcile our differences and work together and, in so doing, will marginalize those who use violence to achieve political objectives.And so we support the formation of the unity Government and the moderate coalition. And it's important for the leader Sistani to understand that's our position. He is a—he lives a secluded life, but he knows that we're interested in defeating extremism, and we're interested in helping advance a unity government.Kelly [Kelly O'Donnell, NBC News].",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct assessment of the importance of Grand Ayatollah Ali al‑Sistani for the future U.S. strategy in Iraq.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response never states explicitly whether Sistani is “important,” “central,” “marginal,” etc.  
   - It mentions that Sistani “knows that we’re interested in defeating extremism” and that the U.S. supports a moderate coalition, but it does not evaluate his *importance* in the strategic equation.  
   - The bulk of the answer discusses troop levels, the Baker‑Hamilton commission, and the need for a specific mission, which are unrelated to the question about Sistani’s significance.

3. **Information type** – The answer provides only a vague reference to Sistani and an indirect implication that he is aware of U.S. intentions. It is **partial and implicit**, offering no clear judgment on his importance.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker deflects from the specific query, shifting to broader topics (troop levels, coalition formation). This is a classic case of **dodging** rather than answering directly.

5. **Classification decision** – Because the response is incomplete, indirect, and does not give a clear, explicit answer to the question, it fits the **Ambivalent** category: the information is given but only in a partial, implicit, and deflecting manner.

277,Are you prepared to pass on the fate of the war to the next President?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Your own military commander suggests that in Iraq, the Iraqi forces are not nearly ready to take over security for their own country, and that U.S. troops will need to stay in the region for many months if not years. Are you prepared to pass on the fate of the war to the next President?And, Mr. Prime Minister, if I may, what do you see as the biggest mistakes in the management of the war, and what do you propose to do to correct them?","David Petraeus, the general on the ground, will be bringing his recommendations back to the Congress on or about September the 15th. And I think it's going to be very important for all of us to wait for him to report. And the reason it's important is, is that I believe that the decisions on the way forward in Iraq must be made with a military recommendation as an integral part of it. And therefore, I don't want to prejudge what David is going to say.I have said this is going to take a long time, just like this ideological—in Iraq, just like the ideological struggle is going to take a long time. And so I look forward to David's report, and then we'll respond accordingly. There has been some notable progress, Anbar Province being such a place where there's bottom-up reconciliation, where people are rejecting this Al Qaida vision of the world and saying, there's a better way forward.There's still setbacks, obviously. We've got these suiciders that are trying to foment sectarian violence. But, Ben, I would ask you and the Congress to wait, to do what I'm doing, which is wait until David to come back and make his report. And I think you'll find it will be considered and based upon the evidence there on the ground. You asked about the difficulties we've faced, and a lot has happened over the last period of time. I think the difficulties include the—getting political reconciliation within Iraq itself, moving forward the reconstruction and the time it has taken to do so.But I think the one thing that I'm pleased about is that Iraq is now building up its own security forces, it's now building up its own military, and it's now building up its own police. So we've got to a situation where there are perhaps 300,000 people who are in the Iraqi security and policing forces.In Basra and in the four Provinces that we're dealing with, security forces have built up over the last few years now to around 30,000 people. It's in that context where we can then achieve what we want to do, which is to pass security over to the Iraqi people themselves, to pass it over to the elected Iraqi Government, and of course, to local Provincial control.And one of the encouraging things that's happened over the last few months, indeed the last year and more, is that we've been able to pass the control of the three of the four Provinces for which we've got responsibility back to Iraqi hands. And of course, the issue in Basra, which is the largest Province, is the point at which we can do what we want to do, which is to have local people and local army and local police in charge of the security there.So that is the challenge that we face over this next period of time: that Iraq itself becomes more responsible for its own security; that we are able to pass control of the Province both to elected politicians and to the security services; and we're able to combine that with the people of Iraq themselves having a stake in the future.So yes, there have been problems, but, yes, also, when you look at the four Provinces for which we've got responsibility, we can see that we're able to move control back to the Iraqi people in three. And there's a chance of being able to do that in the fourth as a result of the buildup of the security forces.Nick [Nick Robinson, BBC News]. Gosh, still hanging around.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct answer to a yes/no‑type question: *Is the speaker prepared to hand over the war’s outcome to the next President?* The expected response would be an explicit “yes,” “no,” or a clear statement of willingness/reluctance.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not give a yes or no. Instead, they:
   - Talk about waiting for General Petraeus’s report.
   - Emphasize that decisions must be based on military recommendations.
   - State they “don’t want to prejudge” what will be said.
   - Shift the focus to future reporting and ongoing progress.

   The response sidesteps the specific question about passing the war’s fate to a future President, offering only a vague promise to “respond accordingly” later.

3. **Information type** – The answer provides only indirect, generic information (the need to await a report) rather than the explicit stance requested. It is incomplete and does not directly answer the query.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker deflects by reframing the issue in terms of procedural waiting and military advice, avoiding a clear position on the succession of war responsibility.

**Conclusion:** The response is neither a straightforward “yes” nor a flat refusal, nor is it a complete non‑answer (some relevant context is offered). It is an incomplete, evasive reply that leaves the question unanswered in the requested form.

With all due respect, Nancy Pelosi has called you incompetent, a liar, the emperor with no clothes, and, as recently as yesterday, dangerous. How will you work with someone who has such little respect for your leadership and who is third in line to the Presidency?","Suzanne, I've been around politics a long time. I understand when campaigns end, and I know when governing begins. And I am going to work with people of both parties.Look, people say unfortunate things at times. But if you hold grudges in this line of work, you're never going to get anything done. And my intention is to get some things done. And as I said, I'm going to start visiting with her on Friday, with the idea of coming together.Look, this was a close election. If you look at race by race, it was close. The cumulative effect, however, was not too close; it was a thumping. But nevertheless, the people expect us to work together. That's what they expect. And as I said in my opening comments, there comes responsibility with victory. And that's what Nancy Pelosi told me this morning. She said in the phone call she wants to work together. And so do I. And so that's how you deal with it.This isn't my first rodeo. In other words, I haven't—this is not the first time I've been in a campaign where people have expressed themselves and in different kinds of ways. But I have learned that if you focus on the big picture, which, in this case, is our Nation and issues we need to work together on, you can get stuff done. For example, the No Child Left Behind Act is going to come up for reauthorization. There's an area where we must work together for the sake of our children and for the sake of a competitive America. And I believe we can get a lot done.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a concrete description of the interviewee’s plan for cooperating with a political figure (Nancy Pelosi) who is alleged to have little respect for his leadership.

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee:
   - States directly that he “is going to work with people of both parties.”
   - Says he will “visit… with her on Friday” and “come together.”
   - Emphasizes not holding grudges and focusing on the “big picture.”
   - Gives examples of areas where cooperation will occur (e.g., reauthorizing No Child Left Behind).
   - Concludes that “she wants to work together” and that he looks forward to talking with her.

   All of these statements are explicit answers to the question: they outline *how* he intends to work with her despite the alleged disrespect.

3. **Is the information explicit?** – Yes. The response does not hedge with vague qualifiers or deflect; it clearly declares the approach (bipartisan cooperation, direct dialogue, focus on shared goals).

4. **Is it incomplete or evasive?** – While the answer is somewhat broad, it nonetheless provides a full, unambiguous plan of action. It does not leave the core question unanswered.

**Conclusion:** The response supplies an explicit, complete answer to the question about how the interviewee will work with the person who has shown disrespect.

279,Was the President able to give President Karzai the assurances he sought about reducing civilian casualties in Afghanistan?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. President Karzai said yesterday that he believed Iran was playing a helpful role in Afghanistan. Was he able to convince you in your meetings that that was the case, or do you still have concerns about Iran's role?And I have a question for President Karzai as well. I'm just wondering if the President was able to give you the assurances that you sought about the effort to reduce civilian casualties in Afghanistan?","Let me comment on the civilian casualties, if I might. First, I fully understand the angst, the agony, and the sorrow that Afghan citizens feel when an innocent life is lost. I know that must cause grief in villages and heartbreak in homes.Secondly, I can assure the Afghan people, like I assured the President, that we do everything that we can to protect the innocent; that our military operations are mindful that innocent life might be exposed to danger, and we adjust accordingly.Thirdly, it is the Taliban who surround themselves with innocent life as human shields. The Taliban are the coldblooded killers. The Taliban are the murderers. The Taliban have no regard for human life. And therefore, we've spent some time talking about—as the President rightly expressed— his concerns about civilian casualty. And I assured him that we share those concerns.Secondly, it's up to Iran to prove to the world that they're a stabilizing force, as opposed to a destabilizing force. After all, this is a Government that has proclaimed its desire to build a nuclear weapon. This is a Government that is in defiance of international accord, a Government that seems to be willing to thumb its nose at the international community and, at the same time, a Government that denies its people a rightful place in the world and denies its people the ability to realize their full potential. So I believe that it's in the interests of all of us that we have an Iran that tries to stabilize, not destabilize, an Iran that gives up its weapons ambitions. And therefore, we're working to that end.The President knows best about what's taking place in his country, and of course, I'm willing to listen. But from my perspective, the burden of proof is on the Iranian Government to show us that they're a positive force. And I must tell you that this current leadership there is a big disappointment to the people of Iran. I mean, the people of Iran could be doing a lot better than they are today. But because of the actions of this Government, this country is isolated. And we will continue to work to isolate it because they're not a force for good, as far as we can see. They're a destabilizing influence wherever they are.Now, the President will have to talk to you about Afghanistan. But I would be very cautious about whether or not the Iranian influence there in Afghanistan is a positive force. And therefore, it's going to be up to them to prove to us and prove to the Government that they are. I had a good discussion with President Bush on civilian casualties. I'm very happy to tell you that President Bush felt very much with the Afghan people, that he calls the Afghan people allies in the war against terror and friends, and that he is as much concerned as I am, as the Afghan people are. I was very happy with that conversation.Lady?",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

280,Desire for Ben Bernanke to stay on when his term ends in January,"Q. Right here, sir. Switching gears slightly, in light of the financial regulation and reform that you have made, what is--how do you rate the performance of the Fed in handling the financial crisis? And more specifically, how do you rate the performance of Ben Bernanke, and would you like him to stay on when his term ends in January?","I'm not going to make news about Ben Bernanke--[]--although I think he has done a fine job under very difficult circumstances.I would say that all financial regulators didn't do everything that needed to be done to prevent the crisis from happening. And that's why we've put forward the boldest set of reforms in financial regulation in 75 years, because there were too many gaps; where there were laws on the books that would have brought about a prevention of the crisis, the enforcement wasn't there. In some cases, there just weren't sufficient laws on the books, for example, with the nonbanking sector.I think that the Fed probably performed better than most other regulators prior to the crisis taking place, but I think they'd be the first to acknowledge that in dealing with systemic risk and anticipating systemic risk, they didn't do everything that needed to be done.I think since the crisis has occurred, Ben Bernanke has performed very well. And one of the central concepts behind our financial regulatory reform is that there's got to be somebody who is responsible not just for monitoring the health of individual institutions, but somebody who's monitoring the systemic risks of the system as a whole. And we believe that the Fed has the most technical expertise and the best track record in terms of doing that.But that's not the only part of financial regulation. One of the things that we're putting a huge amount of emphasis on is the issue of consumer protection, whether it's subprime loans that were given out because nobody was paying attention to what was being peddled to consumers, whether it's how credit cards are handled, how annuities are dealt with, what people can expect in terms of understanding their 401(k)s. There's a whole bunch of financial transactions out there where consumers are not protected the way they should, and that's why we said, we're going to put forward a consumer financial protection agency whose only job it is to focus on those issues.Now, the Fed was one of the regulators that had some of those consumer responsibilities. We actually think that they're better off focusing on issues of broad systemic risk, and we have just one agency that's focused on the consumer protection side.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is explicitly asking whether the interviewee *wants* Ben Bernanke to remain in his position when his term ends in January. The answer should contain a clear statement of that desire (e.g., “Yes, I would like him to stay,” or “No, I do not want him to stay”).

2. **What the answer provides** –  
   - The speaker praises Bernanke’s performance and notes that “the Fed has the most technical expertise… we believe that the Fed has the most technical expertise and the best track record.”  
   - The speaker also discusses the need for systemic‑risk oversight and consumer‑protection reforms, but never states a direct preference about Bernanke’s future employment.  
   - The only implicit cue is the positive assessment of his performance, which could be read as supportive, but the answer never says “I would like him to stay” or “I do not want him to stay.”

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – Requires the requested information to be *explicitly* stated. The answer does **not** contain an explicit statement of desire, so it fails this criterion.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – Would apply if the information were completely absent due to ignorance, refusal, or a request for clarification. While the answer does not give a direct answer, it does provide related commentary (praise, discussion of reforms). Thus it is not a total non‑reply.  
   - **Ambivalent** – Fits when the response is *incomplete, partial, implicit, or deflecting* the specific request. The answer offers a positive evaluation of Bernanke’s work but stops short of answering the explicit question about whether the speaker wants him to stay. This is a classic case of an *implicit* or *partial* response.

4. **Conclusion** – The response is **not a clear reply** (it does not explicitly state the desire) and it is **not a complete non‑reply** (some relevant information is given). It is therefore best classified as **Ambivalent**—the answer is partial and indirect, leaving the requested desire unspecified.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct answer to whether an obvious change to the security situation in Baghdad is possible, and if so, what that change is.

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee does not simply say “yes” or “no.”  
   - Instead, they explicitly state that “there needs to be more forces inside Baghdad who are willing to hold people to account” and that “the Iraqi Army is becoming a highly professional force… to protect them.”  
   - These statements directly identify a concrete security‑related change (increasing forces and improving accountability) that could be made in Baghdad.

3. **Is the information explicit?** – Yes. The answer spells out the specific adjustment to the security posture (more forces, stronger accountability mechanisms) rather than leaving it vague or refusing to answer.

284,Do they still have concerns about Iran's role in Afghanistan?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. President Karzai said yesterday that he believed Iran was playing a helpful role in Afghanistan. Was he able to convince you in your meetings that that was the case, or do you still have concerns about Iran's role?And I have a question for President Karzai as well. I'm just wondering if the President was able to give you the assurances that you sought about the effort to reduce civilian casualties in Afghanistan?","Let me comment on the civilian casualties, if I might. First, I fully understand the angst, the agony, and the sorrow that Afghan citizens feel when an innocent life is lost. I know that must cause grief in villages and heartbreak in homes.Secondly, I can assure the Afghan people, like I assured the President, that we do everything that we can to protect the innocent; that our military operations are mindful that innocent life might be exposed to danger, and we adjust accordingly.Thirdly, it is the Taliban who surround themselves with innocent life as human shields. The Taliban are the coldblooded killers. The Taliban are the murderers. The Taliban have no regard for human life. And therefore, we've spent some time talking about—as the President rightly expressed— his concerns about civilian casualty. And I assured him that we share those concerns.Secondly, it's up to Iran to prove to the world that they're a stabilizing force, as opposed to a destabilizing force. After all, this is a Government that has proclaimed its desire to build a nuclear weapon. This is a Government that is in defiance of international accord, a Government that seems to be willing to thumb its nose at the international community and, at the same time, a Government that denies its people a rightful place in the world and denies its people the ability to realize their full potential. So I believe that it's in the interests of all of us that we have an Iran that tries to stabilize, not destabilize, an Iran that gives up its weapons ambitions. And therefore, we're working to that end.The President knows best about what's taking place in his country, and of course, I'm willing to listen. But from my perspective, the burden of proof is on the Iranian Government to show us that they're a positive force. And I must tell you that this current leadership there is a big disappointment to the people of Iran. I mean, the people of Iran could be doing a lot better than they are today. But because of the actions of this Government, this country is isolated. And we will continue to work to isolate it because they're not a force for good, as far as we can see. They're a destabilizing influence wherever they are.Now, the President will have to talk to you about Afghanistan. But I would be very cautious about whether or not the Iranian influence there in Afghanistan is a positive force. And therefore, it's going to be up to them to prove to us and prove to the Government that they are. I had a good discussion with President Bush on civilian casualties. I'm very happy to tell you that President Bush felt very much with the Afghan people, that he calls the Afghan people allies in the war against terror and friends, and that he is as much concerned as I am, as the Afghan people are. I was very happy with that conversation.Lady?",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step reasoning**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a direct answer to whether the speaker (the President) still has concerns about Iran’s role in Afghanistan.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response explicitly states that concerns remain:  
   - “the burden of proof is on the Iranian Government to show us that they’re a positive force.”  
   - “they’re a destabilizing influence wherever they are.”  
   - “we will continue to work to isolate it because they’re not a force for good.”  
   These statements directly answer the question by confirming that concerns about Iran’s role persist.

3. **Information type** – The requested information (the existence of ongoing concerns) is given **explicitly** and in the form requested (a clear yes/affirmative answer).

4. **Evasion check** – There is no evasion or deflection; the answer directly addresses the concern about Iran’s role rather than sidestepping it.

**Conclusion:** The response provides a clear, explicit answer to the question.

Do you have any plans to formally reappoint him to the post, or any other position at Department of Justice?",As a special prosecutor?,Clear Non-Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking whether the President plans to formally reappoint U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald or place him in any other position within the Department of Justice. The request is for a concrete answer about possible future appointments.

2. **What the answer provides** – The interviewee replies only with the phrase “As a special prosecutor?” which is a question, not a statement. It does not:
   - Confirm or deny any intention to reappoint or appoint him elsewhere,
   - Offer any detail, plan, or even a refusal,
   - Explain the situation or request clarification.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – No, because the requested information (the President’s plans regarding appointment) is not explicitly stated.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – Yes. The response fails to provide any answer at all; it merely raises a question that sidesteps the original query. The lack of an answer is not due to ignorance or a request for clarification—it is an evasion that leaves the question unanswered.  
   - **Ambivalent** – Not applicable, because the answer does not give a partial or vague answer to the question; it simply does not address it.

**Conclusion:** The interviewee’s response constitutes a **Clear Non‑Reply**—the information requested is not given in any form.

On the issue of the multinational force, what shape should it take; who should lead it; who should be part of it? And also, should Hizballah agreeing to it be a precondition for setting up the force?And, Mr. Prime Minister, you talked about a resolution leading to a cessation of hostilities, and I'm just wondering, should it include a call for an immediate cease-fire?","In terms of the troops, that's what the meeting Monday is going to be about. And this is one of these issues that requires international consensus. People will put forth ideas, and we'll participate, in terms of trying to help develop a consensus about what the force ought to look like.In a general sense, though, the force needs to serve as a complement to a Lebanese force. See, that's the whole purpose of the force, is to strengthen the Lebanese Government by helping the Lebanese force move into the area. The whole cornerstone of the policy for Lebanon is for Lebanon to be free and able to govern herself and defend herself with a viable force.And so one of the things you'll see in discussions there is, how do we help the Lebanese Army succeed? What does it— what's required? What's the manpower need to be in order to help this force move into the south so the government can take control of the country. What it looks like— if I hold a press conference on Tuesday, I'll be able to answer that better. But since I probably won't be, read your newspaper.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct answer on whether the forthcoming resolution should contain an explicit call for an immediate cease‑fire.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The respondent talks generally about:
   - Upcoming meetings and building international consensus.
   - The need for a force that complements the Lebanese army.
   - Future press conferences where the answer might be given.
   - A vague reference to “read your newspaper” for more information.

   The response never states a position on whether the resolution should include an immediate cease‑fire call. It merely postpones the answer and offers unrelated context.

3. **Information type** – The requested information is **not provided**; instead, the speaker gives a partial, indirect, and evasive reply that deflects from the specific query.

4. **Evasion / deflection** – The answer is clearly a deflection: it shifts the focus to future discussions and suggests the answer will be given elsewhere, rather than answering the question directly.

5. **Classification decision** – Because the response is incomplete, indirect, and amounts to a deflection rather than a straightforward refusal or ignorance, it fits the **Ambivalent** category (the information is given in an incomplete, implicit, or dodging manner).

287, Do the new findings take the military option off the table?,"Q. Mr. President, a new intelligence report says that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program 4 years ago and that it remains frozen. Are you still convinced that Iran is trying to build a nuclear bomb? And do the new findings take the military option that you've talked about off the table?","Here's what we know. We know that they're still trying to learn how to enrich uranium. We know that enriching uranium is an important step in a country whose desire it was to develop a weapon. We know they had a program. We know the program was halted.I think it is very important for the international community to recognize the fact that if were to develop the knowledge that they could transfer to a clandestine program, it would create a danger for the world. And so I view this report as a warning signal that they had the program; they halted the program. And the reason why it's a warning signal is that they could restart it. And the thing that would make a restarted program effective and dangerous is the ability to enrich uranium, the knowledge of which could be passed on to a hidden program.And so it's a—to me, the NIE provides an opportunity for us to rally the international community—continue to rally the community to pressure the ian regime to suspend its program.You know, the NIE also said that such pressure was effective, and that's what our Government has been explaining to our other partners in keeping the international pressure on .

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct answer to whether the new intelligence findings remove the military option from consideration.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not say “yes” or “no.”  
   - He discusses Iran’s uranium enrichment, the halted program, and the need for international pressure.  
   - He mentions that “the best diplomacy… is one in which all options are on the table,” which actually **implies** the military option remains on the table rather than confirming that it has been removed.  
   - The response is vague, indirect, and does not explicitly answer the question.

3. **Information type** – The answer provides only partial, implicit commentary on the issue. It touches on related themes (pressure, options) but leaves the core question unanswered.

4. **Evasion check** – The response deflects rather than directly answering; it is not a full non‑reply (some relevant points are made), but it is also not a clear, explicit answer.

**Conclusion:** The response is incomplete and indirect—it gives a partial, implicit answer rather than a straightforward yes/no. This fits the definition of an **Ambivalent** reply.

I would ask Congress to listen to leaders on the continent of Africa, find—analyze what works, stop the squabbling, and get the program reauthorized.

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks President Kikwete’s own interpretation of what America’s possible election of a black President with African roots would signify about the United States.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response never directly states what Kikwete thinks about that significance.  
   - It drifts into unrelated topics (PEPFAR, congressional debates, “excitement” about Obama).  
   - It ends with a generic comment about wanting the next U.S. president to be a “good friend of Africa,” which does not answer the specific query about Kikwete’s view of America’s identity.

3. **Nature of the information provided** – The answer is vague, indirect, and only loosely touches on the theme of “excitement” surrounding a potential Obama presidency. It does not articulate Kikwete’s substantive opinion or analysis.

4. **Classification fit** – Because the response offers only a partial, implicit, and largely evasive comment rather than a clear, explicit answer, it matches the **Ambivalent** category: the requested information is given incompletely, in a dodging/deflection manner.

289,What say you about the U.S. boycotting the conference?,"Q. I'll take that one. Well, Mr. President, as you're concluding your summit here and the meeting in Mexico, there is a U.S.--a U.N. conference, the world conference on racism in Geneva tomorrow. The U.S. is boycotting. And what say you about that? And is Zionism a main issue in the reason why the U.S. is boycotting the racism conference?","Well, let me, first of all, say that I believe in the United Nations. I believe in the possibility of the United Nations serving as an effective forum to deal with a whole host of transnational conflicts. And so I want to be as encouraging as I can, and Ive said that to the General-Secretary. For that reason, were actually--have pursued a seat on the Human Rights Commission, the U.N. Human Rights Commission, because even though up until this point we havent been very pleased with how its operated, we think that its worthwhile for us to go in there and try to make it into a constructive organization because of the extraordinary range of human rights violations that exist around the world. And I think America should be a leader; we cant opt out of those discussions.Now, in that same spirit, I would love to be involved in a useful conference that addressed continuing issues of racism and discrimination around the globe, which, by the way, are not a particular province of any one country. Obviously, weve had our own experiences with racial discrimination, but if you come down to Central and South America and the Caribbean, they have all kinds of stories to tell about racial discrimination.Somebody mentioned earlier President Morales. Whatever I think about his politics, the fact that he is the first indigenous--person of indigenous background to be elected in a country that has a enormous indigenous population indicates how much work remains to be done around the world.So we would love to engage constructively in a discussion like that. Heres the problem: You had a previous conference--I believe it was in 2001, maybe it was 2002--I think it was 2001--in which it became a session through which folks expressed antagonism towards Israel in ways that were oftentimes completely hypocritical and counterproductive. And we expressed in the run-up to this conference our concerns that if you incorporated--if you adopted all the language from 2001, thats just not something we could sign up for.So if we have a clean start, a fresh start, were happy to go. If youre incorporating a previous conference that we werent involved with that raised a whole set of objectionable provisions, then we couldnt participate, or it wouldnt be worth it for us to participate because we couldnt get past that particular issue.And unfortunately, even though I think other countries made great efforts to accommodate some of our concerns and assured us that this conference would be more constructive, our participation would have involved putting our imprimatur on something that we just dont believe.So what weve said--and I said this to Secretary-General Moon who was here addressing the summit--were happy to work with them to see if we can move forward on some of these issues. Hopefully some concrete steps come out of the conference that we can partner with other countries on to actually reduce discrimination around the globe. But this wasnt an opportunity to do it.So--okay? I think the--its warm, and Ive got to get home. But I appreciate you guys. Thank you.By the way, whose wallet is this? Is this one of my staffs here? Did you guys put this on--is that yours, Marvin? That was to prop up my remarks? Okay, I dont want you to forget it. Thank you, guys.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

290,What is different about the current set of warnings?,"Q. You said yesterday in your statement that the North Korean nuclear test was unacceptable. Your chief negotiator for the six-party talks said last week that North Korea has a choice of either having weapons or having a future. When you spoke a month or so ago to the American Legion, you talked about Iran and said, There must be consequences for Iran's defiance, and we must not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. I am wondering, sir— your administration has issued these kinds of warnings pretty regularly over the last 5 years, and yet these countries have pursued their nuclear programs. I'm wondering if you—what is different about the current set of warnings, and do you think the administration and our Government runs a risk of looking feckless to the world by issuing these kinds of warnings regularly without response from the countries?","That's a fair question. First of all, I am making it clear our policy hasn't changed. It's important for the folks to understand that we don't continually shift our goals based upon polls or whatever. See, I think clarity of purpose is very important to rally a diplomatic effort to solve the problem. And so I try to speak as clearly as I can and make sure there's no ambiguity in our position. I also found that's a pretty good way to help rally a diplomatic effort that I believe will more likely work.I know this sounds—I'm just saying it over and over again, but it's—rhetoric and actions are all aimed at convincing others that they have an equal stake in whether or not these nations have a nuclear weapon, because I firmly believe, Mike, that that is the best strategy to solve the problem. One has a stronger hand when there's more people playing your same cards. It is much easier for a nation to hear what I believe are legitimate demands if there's more than one voice speaking. And that's why we're doing what we're doing.And to answer your question as to whether or not the words will be empty, I would suggest that, quite the contrary, that we not only have spoken about the goals, but as a result of working together with our friends, Iran and North Korea are looking at a different diplomatic scenario.I thought you were going to ask the question, following up on Sanger, how come you don't use military action now? You kind of hinted it; you didn't say it. And some wonder that. As a matter of fact, I'm asked questions around the country— just go ahead and use the military. And my answer is, is that I believe the Commander in Chief must try all diplomatic measures before we commit our military. And I believe the diplomacy is—we're making progress when we've got others at the table.I'll ask myself a followup. If that's the case, why did you use military action in Iraq? And the reason why is because we tried the diplomacy. Matter of fact, we tried resolution after resolution after resolution. All these situations are—each of them different and require a different response, a different effort to try to solve this peacefully. And we'll continue to do so.The inability to convince people to move forward speaks volumes about them. It ought to say to all the world that we're dealing with people that maybe don't want peace—which, in my judgment, in order for there to be peace, requires an international response. It says volumes about a person who signs an agreement with one administration and signs an agreement or speaks about an agreement with another administration and doesn't honor the agreement. It points up the fact that these are dangerous regimes and requires an international effort to work in concert.Roger [Roger Runningen, Bloomberg News].",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

Quick followup: A lot of the consequences you mentioned for pulling out seem like maybe they never would have been there if we hadn't gone in. How do you square all of that?,"I square it because, imagine a world in which you had Saddam Hussein who had the capacity to make a weapon of mass destruction, who was paying suiciders to kill innocent life, who would—who had relations with Zarqawi. Imagine what the world would be like with him in power. The idea is to try to help change the Middle East.Now, look, part of the reason we went into was—the main reason we went into at the time was we thought he had weapons of mass destruction. It turns out he didn't, but he had the capacity to make weapons of mass destruction. But I also talked about the human suffering in , and I also talked the need to advance a freedom agenda. And so my question— my answer to your question is, is that, imagine a world in which Saddam Hussein was there, stirring up even more trouble in a part of the world that had so much resentment and so much hatred that people came and killed 3,000 of our citizens.You know, I've heard this theory about everything was just fine until we arrived, and then—kind of the stir up the hornet's nest theory. It just doesn't hold water, as far as I'm concerned. The terrorists attacked us and killed 3,000 of our citizens before we started the freedom agenda in the Middle East.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants the interviewee to explain how they reconcile the negative consequences that resulted from pulling out (or from the earlier intervention) with the claim that those consequences would not have existed if the initial action had not been taken. In other words, they are asking for a direct justification or “squaring” of that logical tension.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee responds with a substantive explanation:
   - They begin with “I square it because…”
   - They invoke the hypothetical danger of Saddam Hussein (WMDs, ties to Zarqawi, etc.).
   - They argue that the world would have been worse had he remained in power.
   - They then broaden the discussion to human suffering, a “freedom agenda,” and the terrorist attacks that occurred before the “freedom agenda” began.
   - They explicitly reject the “stir up the hornet’s nest” theory and state their position on the matter.

   The response directly engages with the logical tension the question raises and provides a rationale for how the interviewee “squares” the consequences with the counterfactual claim.

3. **Is the information explicitly stated?** – Yes. The interviewee does not evade, deflect, or give a vague or partial answer. They give a clear, explicit statement of their reasoning (“I square it because…”) and elaborate on the points they consider. While the answer is lengthy and includes additional context, the core justification is fully articulated.

4. **Does it meet any other category?**  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply?** No – the interviewee does give an answer; they are not silent, ignorant, or refusing to respond.  
   - **Ambivalent?** No – the answer is not merely general or incomplete; it directly addresses the specific logical issue posed.

**Conclusion:** The response provides an explicit, direct justification for how the interviewee reconciles the mentioned consequences with the counterfactual claim. Therefore it fits the **Clear Reply** category.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking for the interviewee’s judgment on two linked points:  
   a) Whether the reported acceleration of laser‑guided missile and bunker‑buster deliveries to Israel is true, and  
   b) Whether, if true, this policy is contradictory given that Israel’s actions are causing civilian deaths while the administration simultaneously tries to aid the victims.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee gives a direct response:  
   - “No, I don’t see a contradiction in us honoring commitments we made prior to Hizballah attacks into Israeli territory.”  
   This explicitly answers the “do you see it as contradictory?” part of the question.  
   - The rest of the answer discusses humanitarian aid, concern for innocent lives, and the Iraqi security plan, but these are supplemental; they do not obscure the explicit denial of any contradiction.

3. **Information type** – The requested information (the interviewee’s view on whether the policy is contradictory) is **explicitly stated**. The answer provides a clear “No, I don’t see a contradiction,” which is precisely the form requested.

4. **Evasion or deflection?** – While the response also touches on related broader themes, it does not evade the core question. The central claim of contradiction is directly and unambiguously answered.

**Conclusion:** The response supplies the requested judgment in an explicit, straightforward manner.

293,Are you following this movement?,"Q. Thank you, Mr. President. As you travel the country, you also take credit for tightening regulations on Wall Street through the Dodd-Frank law and about your efforts to combat income inequality. There's this movement--Occupy Wall Street--which has spread from Wall Street to other cities. They clearly don't think that you or Republicans have done enough, that you're, in fact, part of the problem.Are you following this movement, and what would you say to its--people that are attracted to it?","Obviously, I've heard of it. I've seen it on television. I think it expresses the frustrations that the American people feel, that we had the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression, huge collateral damage all throughout the country, all across Main Street, and yet you're still seeing some of the same folks who acted irresponsibly trying to fight efforts to crack down on abusive practices that got us into this problem in the first place.So yes, I think people are frustrated and the protestors are giving voice to a more broad-based frustration about how our financial system works. Now, keep in mind, I have said before and I will continue to repeat, we have to have a strong, effective financial sector in order for us to grow. And I used up a lot of political capital, and I've got the dings and bruises to prove it, in order to make sure that we prevented a financial meltdown and that banks stayed afloat. And that was the right thing to do, because had we seen a financial collapse then the damage to the American economy would have been even worse.But what I've also said is that for us to have a healthy financial system, that requires that banks and other financial institutions compete on the basis of the best service and the best products and the best price, and it can't be competing on the basis of hidden fees, deceptive practices, or derivative cocktails that nobody understands and that expose the entire economy to enormous risks. And that's what Dodd-Frank was designed to do. It was designed to make sure that we didn't have the necessity of taxpayer bailouts. That we said, you know what? We're going to be able to control these situations so that if these guys get into trouble, we can isolate them, quarantine them, and let them fail. It says that we're going to have a consumer watchdog on the job all the time who's going to make sure that they are dealing with customers in a fair way and we're eliminating hidden fees on credit cards and mortgage brokers are going to have to--actually have to be straight with people about what they're purchasing.And what we've seen over the last year is not only did the financial sector, with the Republican Party in Congress, fight us every inch of the way, but now you've got these same folks suggesting that we should roll back all those reforms and go back to the way it was before the crisis. Today, my understanding is, we're going to have a hearing on Richard Cordray, who is my nominee to head up the . He would be America's chief consumer watchdog when it comes to financial products. Now, this is a guy who is well regarded in his home State of Ohio, has been the treasurer of Ohio, the attorney general of Ohio. Republicans and Democrats in Ohio all say that he is a serious person who looks out for consumers. He has a good reputation. And Republicans have threatened not to confirm him not because of anything he's done, but because they want to roll back the whole notion of having a consumer watchdog.You've got Republican Presidential candidates whose main economic policy proposals is, we'll get rid of the financial reforms that are designed to prevent the abuses that got us into this mess in the first place. That does not make sense to the American people. They are frustrated by it. And they will continue to be frustrated by it until they get a sense that everybody is playing by the same set of rules and that you're rewarded for responsibility and doing the right thing as opposed to gaming the system.So I'm going to be fighting every inch of the way here in Washington to make sure that we have a consumer watchdog that is preventing abusive practices by the financial sector.I will be hugely supportive of banks and financial institutions that are doing the right thing by their customers. We need them to be lending. We need them to be lending more to small businesses. We need them to help do what traditionally banks and financial services are supposed to be doing, which is providing business and families resources to make productive investments that will actually build the economy. But until the American people see that happening, yes, they are going to continue to express frustrations about what they see as two sets of rules.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct answer to the yes/no query: *“Are you following this movement?”*  
   The expected response would be a clear affirmation or denial, possibly with a brief explanation.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not give a simple “yes” or “no.”  
   Instead they say:  
   - “Obviously, I’ve heard of it. I’ve seen it on television.”  
   - Then they elaborate on the frustrations expressed by the protestors, discuss Dodd‑Frank, etc.  

   The reply mentions awareness of the movement but stops short of explicitly stating whether the speaker is *following* it (i.e., actively tracking, engaging with, or monitoring it). The answer is broad, indirect, and shifts to a discussion of policy rather than confirming personal follow‑up.

3. **Information type** – The core request (a clear statement about following the movement) is only partially satisfied. The speaker acknowledges having heard of the movement, which is a minimal acknowledgment, but the response remains vague and does not directly answer the yes/no question.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The answer deflects from the specific question by moving into a general commentary about the movement’s significance and related policy issues. This is characteristic of an *ambivalent* response: the information is given, but incompletely and in a way that avoids a straightforward answer.

**Conclusion:** The response provides only a partial, indirect answer to the question “Are you following this movement?” and therefore falls into the **Ambivalent** category.

294,Are you still convinced that Iran is trying to build a nuclear bomb?,"Q.

And do the new findings take the military option that you've talked about off the table?","Here's what we know. We know that they're still trying to learn how to enrich uranium. We know that enriching uranium is an important step in a country whose desire it was to develop a weapon. We know they had a program. We know the program was halted.I think it is very important for the international community to recognize the fact that if were to develop the knowledge that they could transfer to a clandestine program, it would create a danger for the world. And so I view this report as a warning signal that they had the program; they halted the program. And the reason why it's a warning signal is that they could restart it. And the thing that would make a restarted program effective and dangerous is the ability to enrich uranium, the knowledge of which could be passed on to a hidden program.And so it's a—to me, the NIE provides an opportunity for us to rally the international community—continue to rally the community to pressure the ian regime to suspend its program.You know, the NIE also said that such pressure was effective, and that's what our Government has been explaining to our other partners in keeping the international pressure on .

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct assessment: *“Are you still convinced that Iran is trying to build a nuclear bomb?”* The expected answer would be a clear “yes,” “no,” or a qualified statement that directly addresses the conviction.

2. **What the answer provides** – The interviewee discusses:
   - That Iran “had a program” and “halted” it.
   - That enrichment capability is a “warning signal” that could be revived.
   - That the intelligence report is a “warning signal” and that the administration will “rally the international community” to pressure Iran.
   - That “effective diplomacy… is one in which all options are on the table.”

   The response never states explicitly whether the speaker is *still convinced* that Iran is *trying* to build a bomb. It offers related context and implications but stops short of a direct affirmation or denial.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – Requires the requested information to be explicitly stated. The answer does **not** give a straightforward “yes” or “no” (or a clear qualified answer) about the conviction.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – Would apply if the interviewee gave *no* relevant information at all (e.g., “I don’t know,” or refused to answer). Here, relevant information *is* provided, albeit indirectly.  
   - **Ambivalent** – Fits when the answer is given but is incomplete, partial, implicit, or deflects from the direct question. The response discusses the program, its halt, and the strategic implications, but it never directly answers the specific query about current conviction. This is a classic case of **dodging/deflection**: the speaker reframes the issue rather than answering the yes/no question.

4. **Conclusion** – The answer is **not** a clear reply, nor is it a total non‑reply; it is an incomplete, indirect response that sidesteps the explicit question.

295,Non-Proliferation Treaty and Iran's knowledge to enrich uranium,"Q. Mr. President, to go back to Iran for a minute, the Non-Proliferation Treaty doesn't prohibit a country like Iran from having the knowledge to enrich uranium. Are you setting a different standard in this case and a different international obligation on Iran? And is that going to complicate the efforts to keep the pressure on when it comes to sanctions at the United Nations?","The problem that most of the world has seen in stems from the fact that they hid their program. That's what the NIE says. The '68 agreement that signed contemplated full transparency and openness. They didn't contemplate a regime that would have a covert nuclear weapons program, all the more reason for the international community to continue to work together. If somebody hid their program once, they could hide it again. If somebody defied the agreement that they signed, the codicils of the agreement they've signed, they could do it again. And most of the world understands that with a nuclear weapon would be a serious danger to peace, and therefore, now is the time to work together to convince them to suspend their program.People say, Would you ever talk to ? For you veterans here, for those who have been following this administration for a while, you might remember that I have consistently said that we will be at the table with the EU-3 if would verifiably suspend their program, and the offer still stands.What changed was the change of leadership in . In other words, we had a diplomatic track going, and Ahmadi-nejad came along and took a different tone.

There's a better way forward for the ian people than one in which they find themselves isolated in the world. Their economy can be stronger. But their leadership is going to have to understand that defiance and hiding programs and defying IAEA is not the way forward.And my hope is, is that the ian regime takes a look at their policies and changes their policies back to where we were prior to the election of Ahmadi-nejad, which was a hopeful period. They had suspended their program; they were at the table. The United States had made some very positive gestures to convince them that there was a better way forward.

1. **What the question asks**  
   - It seeks a direct assessment of whether the administration is applying a different standard to Iran under the Non‑Proliferation Treaty (NPT) regarding its right to acquire uranium‑enrichment knowledge, and whether that will affect UN sanctions pressure.

2. **How the answer addresses it**  
   - The response talks about Iran’s alleged concealment of a nuclear program, references the NPT’s requirement for “full transparency,” and mentions past diplomatic efforts.  
   - It does not explicitly answer whether a *different standard* is being set, nor does it explain how this will *complicate sanctions*.  
   - The answer is largely a general discussion of Iran’s behavior and the need for compliance, without directly addressing the specific comparative standard or sanction implications.

3. **Information type**  
   - The answer provides **partial, implicit information** related to the topic (Iran’s covert program, NPT obligations) but stops short of giving a clear, targeted response to the question’s two‑part query.  
   - It is not a full refusal to answer (so it isn’t a “Clear Non‑Reply”), nor is it a straightforward, explicit answer (so it isn’t a “Clear Reply”).

4. **Evasion/deflection**

Your Excellency, President Musharraf has issued a call for building bridges and promoting interfaith harmony between the West and the Islamic world, which is in upheaval and in complete turmoil. So your comments of Islamic fascists and then the comments of the Pope have inflamed the Islamic world. And my question is that— would you take the leading role, along with President Musharraf, to build these bridges and promote interfaith harmony to avert any wrong notion of class of civilizations, sir?","I appreciate the President's leadership in promoting harmony. There is unbelievable propaganda in the Middle East these days that try to inflame passion. The propagandists are attempting to create conditions where terror is justified. And so at my speech at the United Nations, I stood up and said loud and clear, America respects Islam. And we do. We don't respect people who kill in the name of Islam to achieve political objectives, like the terrorists do.As a matter of fact, these extremists exploit propaganda in order to justify their behavior. All of us need to step up and talk about a world in which we respect each other's religions. As a matter of fact, it's very important for Muslims around the world to know, there's a lot of Muslims living at peace here in the United States. They are proud Americans, and they're equal to me as a citizen. We respect their religions.I repeat to you, however, that the free world and the moderate world must stand up to these extremists and not let them spread their hateful propaganda, not let them try to incite people to acts of violence, because these extremists are not only against Western people, they're also against moderate people. And the President is reaching out to help understand—the world to understand that the Muslim religion is a peaceful religion—is very important. And we can help, and we will help.One way we can help is to work with the Palestinians and the Israelis to achieve peace. I'm the first President ever to have articulated a two-state solution. I believe a Palestinian state, as a democracy living side by side with Israel, will yield the peace. What's important is for people to understand that in order to have that peace and that Palestinian state, people have got to recognize Israel's right to exist in order for this to happen. You can't ask people to negotiate with people who say you shouldn't exist.We will continue to give aid to people who suffer. We didn't ask the question whether—you know, what was the nature of the religion of the people who suffered in Pakistan when we spent a half a billion dollars to help this President. We said, they're suffering, and we want to help. And so we will continue to outreach.It's important, however, for people in the Middle East to reject the extremist propaganda that is spreading, in many cases, absolute lies about the intentions of the United States. They love to say this is a war against Islam; I can't think of anything more false. These are moderate, reasonable people who reject extremism in order for there to be peace.

   - **Clear Reply:** The answer does **not** explicitly state the requested information. → *No.*  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply:** This would apply if the interviewee simply refused to answer, cited ignorance, or asked for clarification. Here the interviewee *does* answer, but the answer is a **deflection** that sidesteps the question entirely. → *Not a pure non‑reply.*  
   - **Ambivalent:** This category covers answers that are **incomplete, partial, implicit, or deflective**—exactly what occurs here. The response is a vague, off‑topic deflection rather than a direct answer.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   The interviewee’s reply is a **deflection** that fails to provide the requested information about concern over the Beirut Airport bombing. It fits the definition of an **Ambivalent** response.

What are your thoughts?","My thoughts are that the local police will make the proper decision and that if they decide for him not to go— like it looks like they have—I can understand why they would not want somebody who is running a country who is a state sponsor of terror down there at the site.Roger [Roger Runningen, Bloomberg News].",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step reasoning**

1. **What the question asks:**  
   The interviewer asks, “What are your thoughts?” – a request for the interviewee’s opinion or reaction to the reported plan for Iran’s President Ahmadi‑nejad to visit Ground Zero.

2. **How the answer responds:**  
   The interviewee says:  
   - “My thoughts are that the local police will make the proper decision…”  
   - “…and that if they decide for him not to go… I can understand why they would not want somebody who is running a country who is a state sponsor of terror down there at the site.”  

   This directly states the speaker’s viewpoint on the matter.

3. **Is the information explicit?**  
   Yes. The response clearly articulates the thoughts being expressed, even though the phrasing is somewhat diplomatic. It does not evade the question or remain silent; it provides a substantive answer.

4. **Does it meet the “Clear Reply” definition?**  
   The definition requires that the requested information be *explicitly stated* in the requested form. The interviewee’s thoughts are explicitly given, albeit in a measured, diplomatic manner.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   The answer fulfills the criteria for a **Clear Reply** – it explicitly states the thoughts being asked for, without significant omission or deflection.

1. **What the question asks** – “And if not, why not?” seeks a justification for why the speaker has not spoken directly with Prime Ministers Olmert and Siniora. The answer should give a clear reason.

2. **How the answer responds** – The interviewee says:  
   *“Because Condi is handling those conversations, and she's doing a fine job of doing so. Yes.”*  
   This directly supplies a reason: the conversations are being handled by Condi, and she is doing a good job.

3. **Is the information explicit?** – Yes. The reason is stated plainly; there is no evasion, deflection, or vague language. The answer fully addresses the “why not” part of the question.

4. **Does it meet any other category?** –  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** would apply only if the information were omitted entirely. Here a reason is given.  
   - **Ambivalent** would apply if the answer were incomplete, partial, or dodging. The answer is not vague; it provides a concrete justification.

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking whether, in earlier talks with Prime Minister Maliki, the interviewee felt confident that Maliki shares the interviewee’s view on Iraq. The expected answer would be a direct assessment (e.g., “Yes, I was confident,” or “No, I was not confident,” possibly with brief justification).

2. **What the answer provides** – The interviewee replies only with the word **“On Iran?”**. This response:
   - Does not address the substance of the question (confidence about Maliki’s view on Iraq).
   - Does not give any affirmation, denial, or explanation.
   - Instead shifts the focus to a completely different topic (Iran).

3. **Evaluation against the classification categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – Requires the requested information to be explicitly stated. The answer does **not** state any confidence level or provide any relevant information.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – Applies when the information requested is **not given at all** because the respondent declines to answer, is ignorant, or deflects. The reply “On Iran?” is a deflection that completely avoids answering the question.  
   - **Ambivalent** – Would require a partially complete or vague answer that still touches on the requested information. Here the answer does not even touch the requested information.

4. **Conclusion** – The response fails to provide any of the requested information and instead deflects to an unrelated topic. This matches the definition of a **Clear Non‑Reply**.

301,"What does this say about the Democratic leadership, the way they're running Congress, and your relations with the leaders?","Q. Mr. President, a year ago when you were—had your year-end press conference, the Democrats had just taken control of Congress. They said that one of their main goals was to end the war in Iraq. They were talking a lot about very contentious times ahead. As you just said, the Congress has now passed again, without strings, money for the war, and you've achieved a lot of your goals and have gotten a lot of things you wanted from Congress without a lot of give-and-take with them by talking tough with firm veto threats. What does this stay—say about the Democratic leadership, the way they're running Congress, and your relations with the leaders?","You know, I don't view— I just don't view life as zero-sum. I think there—all of us deserve credit for getting some things done. The President constantly has to make sure that the executive branch is involved in the process, and one way is to use the veto. And the veto wouldn't have been effective without close coordination and consultation with Republican leaders in the House and the Senate. And in that, we made the veto effective. It then meant that negotiations could proceed with the President involved.And so I really don't sit here and say, Well, you know, he won, they lost, or They won, he lost—it's just not my nature—because I think what ended up happening was good for the country. I think it's good that we ended up with a spending bill that met 933, but also dealt with some emergencies. I think it's good that we funded our troops without an artificial timetable for withdrawal. I think it's good for the country that that happened.I know it's good that we passed an important piece of energy legislation. I proposed that in my State of the Union, but it required a Congress willing to work with the executive branch and to work among themselves to get the bill passed. So there's plenty of credit to go around.I know we live in an environment here in Washington where—I'm not saying you try to stir this up, but sometimes it's beneficial to constantly harp on, well, they don't get along here, or maybe they can't agree here. It's so-and-so versus so-and-so; it's an antagonistic world from some people's point of view. I try to make it less that way and to focus on high priorities.And we got a lot of priorities for next year. And one of my priorities—this is— I understand this is a bone of contention, but one of the priorities is to make sure they don't run up the taxes on people. And my attitude is, if you run them up on one area, it'll become a habit that will be hard to break, and then they'll try to run them up on other areas. And the reason I feel strongly about that is I don't want to undermine the economy by raising taxes.There's some areas where we can work together, like reauthorization of No Child Left Behind, although I will warn Congress that—in that the current bill doesn't expire, if they try to weaken the current bill, I'll veto any attempt to weaken it. But I believe we can strengthen it. I spoke to Senator Kennedy on this issue and Congressman Miller and Senator Enzi and Congressman Boehner about how to strengthen No Child.I mean, there's a lot of things we can do together, I guess what I'm saying, John. And so I leave the year feeling good about our capacity to get some important things done. And of course, I'm grateful that the troops got funded. One of the—one of my concerns from the last year was that Congress initially spent a lot of time on passing resolutions and sentiment and trying to put—trying to tell our commanders how to conduct the war. And it just didn't work. But they spent a lot of time on the subject, which meant when we came down to the end of the year, there was a lot of unfinished business. But we got it done.Yes, Bill [Bill Plante, CBS News].",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct assessment of three things:  
   * What the recent congressional actions reveal about the Democratic leadership,  
   * How the Democrats are running Congress, and  
   * The nature of the President’s relationship with Democratic leaders.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The response never isolates or directly answers those three points. Instead it:  
   * Shifts to a general philosophical stance (“I don’t view life as zero‑sum”).  
   * Talks about credit‑sharing, vetoes, coordination with *Republican* leaders, spending bills, energy legislation, tax policy, and education reauthorizations.  
   * Uses vague, generic statements (“there’s plenty of credit to go around”) without tying them back to the Democratic leadership or the President’s relations with Democratic leaders.  
   * Ends with a series of loosely related policy examples and then trails off.

3. **Information type** – The answer provides only **partial, implicit commentary** and **deflects** from the specific question. It does not give a clear, explicit evaluation of the Democratic leadership or the President‑Democratic leader relationship.

4. **Evasion / deflection** – The speaker avoids naming or critiquing the Democratic leadership directly; the remarks are general and could apply to any political context. This is characteristic of an **ambivalent** response—information is offered but incompletely and indirectly.

**Conclusion:** The response is not a clear non‑reply (some relevant content is offered), nor is it a clear reply (it does not directly answer the question). It is an incomplete, indirect, and deflecting answer.

302,Conditions on the ground in Baghdad and the potential significant withdrawal of American forces by the end of the year,"Q. Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister, why should one expect this new security crackdown in Baghdad to succeed when all previous ones have failed?And, Mr. President, you've said before that withdrawal of U.S. troops would depend on conditions on the ground. What do conditions on the ground now in Baghdad suggest in terms of whether there can be a significant withdrawal of American forces by the end of the year?","I'll start—do you want to start? Go ahead. Actually, the circumstances that the Baghdad security plans, or other plans related to Basra and other places, are different in terms of circumstances from the previous plans. Today, Iraq has a national unity Government that—it is basically composed of—all elements of the Iraqi people are represented in this Government. Iraq has a parliament; it has a Constitution to face all these challenges. So what the Baghdad security plan gains, in terms of support, is support from all over the segments of the Iraqi population.Secondly, by monitoring the reality on the ground, we will be able to ensure the success, especially what happens against the innocent people. The Baghdad security forces was able to eliminate many hotspots of crimes and troubles in Baghdad. One of the things that's important is for—and one of the reasons why you trust the commanders on the ground is because there needs to be flexibility. And I explained to the Prime Minister that I'll be making my decisions based upon the recommendations of General Casey. And obviously, the violence in Baghdad is still terrible, and therefore, there needs to be more troops. In other words, the commanders said, What more can we do; how best to address the conditions on the ground? And they have recommended, as a result of working with the Prime Minister, based upon his recommendation, that we increase the number of U.S. troops in Baghdad alongside of Iraqi troops. And we're going to do that.The second request that the Prime Minister made was that he needs more equipment for his troops. And General Dempsey, along with General Casey, have reviewed his requests and his ideas. And I told the Prime Minister if this is what these generals recommend, it's what I support.Conditions change inside a country, Tom. And the question is, are we going to be facile enough to change with—will we be nimble enough; will we be able to deal with the circumstances on the ground? And the answer is, yes, we will.Mr. Prime Minister, would you like to call on somebody? There you go.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks**  
   - It requests a judgment about *the current conditions on the ground in Baghdad* and *whether those conditions suggest a significant withdrawal of U.S. forces by the end of the year*.

2. **How the answer addresses the question**  
   - The interviewee discusses the *nature of the security plan*, the *representativeness of the Iraqi government*, and *monitoring on the ground*.  
   - He mentions that commanders “recommended … that we increase the number of U.S. troops in Baghdad” and that decisions will be based on those recommendations.  
   - He also says conditions are “still terrible” and that “we will be nimble enough … to deal with the circumstances on the ground,” but he does **not** give a clear, definitive statement about whether a significant withdrawal will occur or not.  
   - The response is therefore **partial**: it touches on the relevant topics but stops short of a direct answer, instead offering generalities, reassurances, and a deflection to future recommendations.

3. **Information type**  
   - The answer provides **some** relevant information (e.g., that more troops may be added, that decisions depend on commanders), but it remains **incomplete** and **implicit** regarding the specific query about a withdrawal timeline.  
   - It does not outright refuse to answer (so it isn’t a “Clear Non‑Reply”), nor does it give a straightforward, explicit answer (so it isn’t a “Clear Reply”).

4. **Conclusion**

303," If so, why?","Q. If so, why? And do you believe that the biggest drag on the Republican Party is the situation in Iraq?","I believe that the situation in Iraq is, no question, tough on the American psyche, like I said, I think, at this very spot last time I faced the press corps. And it's serious business. Look, the American people want to know, can we win— that's what they want to know—and do we have a plan to win. There are some who say, Get out. It's not worth it. And those are some of the voices, by the way, in the Democrat Party. Certainly not all Democrats, but some of the loud voices in the party say, Get out.And so no question this is an issue, but so is the economy. And I believe there'll be—I still stand by my prediction, we'll have a Republican Speaker and a Republican leader of the Senate. And the reason I say that is because I believe the two biggest issues in this campaign are, one, the economy. And the economy is growing. The national unemployment rate is 4.6 percent. We've just discovered, as the result of analyzing new data, that we added 6.6 million new jobs since August of 2003. Gas prices are down. Tax cuts are working.And there's a difference of opinion in the campaign about taxes, and we will keep them low. Matter of fact, I would like to keep the—make the tax cuts we pass permanent. And the Democrats will raise taxes. Now, I know they say only on rich people, but that's—in my judgment, having been around here long enough to know, it's just code word. They're going to raise them on whoever they can raise them on.And then on security, the American people know that our biggest job is to protect this country from further attack, and—because they know there's an enemy that still plots and plans. And there is; there is. Recently we learned that, when British intelligence and U.S. intelligence—with our help—broke up a plot to get on airplanes and blow them up, the planes that were going to fly from Great Britain to here. And they want to know—they, the people—want to know what are we doing to protect them.There have been some votes on the floor of the Senate and the House that make it abundantly clear, we just have a different view of the world. The vast majority of Democrats voted against a program that would enable us to interrogate high-value detainees. That was the vote. It's wide open for everybody to see: Should a CIA program go forward or not go forward? The vast majority of Democrats in the House voted against a program that would have institutionalized the capacity for this Government to listen to Al Qaida phone calls or Al Qaida affiliate phone calls coming from outside the country to inside the country.It's very important for our fellow citizens to recognize that I don't question anybody's patriotism, but I do question a strategy that says, we can't give those on the frontline of fighting terror the tools necessary to fight terror. I believe that in order to defend America, we must take a threat seriously and defeat an enemy overseas so we don't have to face them here. I don't believe we can wait to respond after attack has occurred.And so I think these are the two biggest issues, Bret. And Iraq is a part of the war on terror. Now, I recognize Democrats say that's not the case, and what I say to the American people when I am out there is, all you've got to do is listen to what Usama bin Laden says. Don't believe me that it's a part of the war on terror; listen to the enemy, or listen to Mr. Zawahiri, the number two of Al Qaida, both of whom made it clear that Iraq is central in their plans. And I firmly believe that American people understand that this is different from other war because in this war, if we were to leave early before the job is done, the enemy will follow us here.And so I believe, Bret, that we'll maintain control because we're on the right side of the economic issue and the security issue.Let's see.

304,Request for the speaker's understanding and response to the frustration,"Q. Yes, indeed. In reading the 1559 resolution and the draft as it's currently constructed, there are a lot of similarities, quite frankly. And I'm wondering if you could speak to, maybe, the frustration some Americans might be feeling that you've said we want sustainable peace; we don't want to come back here in a few months or a few years, and yet it seems like there will be another resolution, maybe another resolution, maybe another this, that, and the other. People get frustrated. Can you understand that and respond to that, sir?","Well, the people who should get really frustrated are the Israelis and the Lebanese. They ought to be the ones who are frustrated, because 1559 clearly laid a way forward for there to be a strong democracy in Lebanon, which will more likely yield the peace. And there is a level of frustration around the world with organizations that will take innocent life to achieve political objectives. And our job is to remind people that this isn't a moment; this is a movement, and that we must deal with this movement. We must deal with this movement with strong security measures; we must bring justice to those who would attack us, and at the same time, defeat their ideology by the spread of liberty.And it takes a lot of work. This is the beginning of a long struggle against an ideology that is real and profound. It's Islamo-fascism. It comes in different forms. They share the same tactics, which is to destroy people and things in order to create chaos in the hopes that their vision of the world become predominant in the Middle East.And Condi and I will work hard—by the way, the United States can't win this war alone. We can do damage to the enemy. We can take the philosophical high ground and remind people of the importance of how freedom can change societies. But we will work with allies and friends to achieve this objective. And part of the challenge in the 21st century is to remind people about the stakes and remind people that in moments of quiet, there's still an Islamic fascist group plotting, planning, and trying to spread their ideology. And one of the things that—one of the things that came out of this unfortunate incident in the Middle East is, it is a stark reminder that there are those who want to stop the advance of liberty and destabilize young democracies. And they're willing to kill people to do so.I repeat, this whole incident started because Hizballah kidnaped two soldiers and launched rocket attacks. And it's been unfortunate that people on both sides of the border have lost life. And we're committed to helping the Lebanese Government rebuild.On the other hand, what we won't do is allow for a false hope. We believe that it's important to challenge the root cause now. We thought we had done so with 1559, but 1559 wasn't implemented. In other words, there was a way forward to deal with the problem. And now there's another chance to deal with the problem, and that's the role of the United States, working with others to not only remind people about the problem but to come up with solutions in dealing with the problem. And the solutions that we are working with our friends are—in our judgment, is the best hope for achieving stability and peace.But it takes a lot of work. And it takes commitment and focus. And that's what this administration will continue to do. We'll stay focused on the problem and stay focused on coming up with solutions that, when implemented, will leave behind a better world.Thank you all very much for your interest.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer is asking the speaker to *acknowledge* the frustration that some Americans feel about repeatedly issuing resolutions (e.g., “1559”) and to *respond* to that frustration directly.

2. **What the answer contains** –  
   - The speaker talks about frustration, but shifts the focus to “the people who should get really frustrated are the Israelis and the Lebanese.”  
   - He discusses broader themes (the need for democracy, the fight against “Islamo‑fascism,” the importance of liberty, etc.).  
   - He does not directly address the specific American frustration about repeated resolutions or offer a clear, targeted response to that sentiment.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply** – No. The answer does not explicitly state an understanding of the American frustration nor give a concise response to it.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply** – No. The speaker does provide some related commentary; it is not a total refusal or an admission of ignorance.  
   - **Ambivalent** – Yes. The response touches on the idea of frustration and offers a general, somewhat tangential answer, but it is incomplete, indirect, and deflects the specific question. It is therefore an incomplete/partial answer that dodges the precise request.

**Conclusion:** The response is **Ambivalent**.

305,"Mr. President, we know that you talked about Iran and North Korea. Let me ask you if you moved forward at all on these issues?","Q. Mr. President, we know that you talked about Iran and North Korea. Let me ask you if you moved forward at all on these issues? Did you ask Russia to take specific steps, for example with Iran, to agree to U.N. sanctions? Did you discuss what you could move on—in North Korea to move it forward?And, President Putin, is Russia now willing, if necessary, to vote for sanctions in the United Nations to stop Iran's nuclear preparations?","We strategized on both issues. But this isn't the first time that we've talked together to—on how to solve problems. You might remember that Russia proposed a very interesting way forward for . It was the Putin Government that said to the ians, If you want a civilian nuclear power program, we will support you in that; however, we will provide the fuel, and we'll collect the spent fuel. I thought it was a very innovative approach to solving the problem. I strongly supported the initiatives.So, Bill [Bill Plante, CBS News], to answer your question, this isn't the first time that we have strategized on how to solve this problem. And, yes, we talked about the U.N. Security Council resolution. And, no, I'm not going to tell you the particulars about the conversation. I will tell you, however, that there is common agreement that we need to get something done at the U.N., and I'm confident we will be able to do that. And there's agreement that we need to get something done on North Korea at the United Nations.Here's the thing, though, just so that everybody understands: Diplomacy is not two countries just saying, this is the way it is. Diplomacy is two countries agreeing to work together with other countries, in this case, to come up with common language that we can live with that sends the same message, and that is, no nuclear weapons programs.Our goal and objective is to have a nuclear-free—nuclear weapons-free Korean Peninsula. Russia shares that objective, China shares the objective, Japan shares the objective, and South Korea shares the objective. So we've got common ground to move forward, and now we're working on language. And it was a very constructive meeting. You know, I have spoken on this count for many times. I can repeat, it is not in Russia's national interest to see a proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, especially in such an explosive region as the Middle East.This is something that we tell our ian partners directly. We have always told them about it. There is nothing novel or new about our position in this respect. But we work on the assumption that we have to find efficient ways of ensuring security around the world. We need to take efficient diplomatic steps that would not disrupt the gentle fabric of the negotiations in the search for mutually acceptable decisions. And we're satisfied with the status of the U.S.-Russia relationship in this area.",Clear Reply,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants to know whether any concrete progress was made on the issues of Iran and North Korea, i.e., whether the parties “moved forward at all” on those topics.

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee replies:
   - “We strategized on both issues… this isn’t the first time that we’ve talked together… we talked about the U.N. Security Council resolution… there is common agreement that we need to get something done at the U.N., and I’m confident we will be able to do that.”
   - “We’ve got common ground to move forward, and now we’re working on language.”
   - “Diplomacy is … two countries agreeing to work together … to come up with common language … that sends the same message, and that is, no nuclear weapons programs.”
   - The speaker explicitly says they are “working on language,” have “common ground to move forward,” and are confident something will be done at the U.N.

   These statements directly answer the question by confirming that progress (strategizing, agreement on language, planning for a U.N. resolution) is being made on both Iran and North Korea.

3. **Is the information explicit?** – Yes. The response clearly states that the parties are *strategizing*, *working on language*, and have *common agreement* to move forward. The answer does not hedge with “I don’t know” or refuse to comment; it affirms movement forward.

4. **Is there evasion or incompleteness?** – The answer is somewhat broad, but it does not dodge the core query. It provides a substantive, explicit response about the status of negotiations, rather than leaving the question unanswered or only partially addressing it.

**Conclusion:** The interviewee gives a clear, explicit answer to the question about whether any forward movement occurred on Iran and North Korea.

**Classification:** **Clear Reply**","[{'format': 'unknown', 'index': 0, 'type': 'reasoning.text', 'text': 'We need to classify the response to the specific question: ""Mr. President, we know that you talked about Iran and North Korea.

Security Council resolution... I\'m not going to tell you the particulars... there is common agreement that we need to get something done at the U.N., and I\'m confident we will be able to do that."" It mentions moving forward? It says they strategized, they talked about resolution, they have common agreement, working on language. It does indicate progress? It says they are working on language, they have common ground, it\'s constructive. So it does address whether they moved forward: they strategized, they discussed, they have common agreement, working on language. It\'s somewhat explicit but somewhat vague. It does give an answer: they are working on language, they have common ground, they will get something done. So it\'s a clear reply? It explicitly states they are moving forward (working on language, common agreement). It\'s not evasive; it\'s answering. It\'s somewhat general but directly addresses the question.

306," Is there anything that's disappointed you about the recovery, the Federal response?","Q. Is there anything that's disappointed you about the recovery, the Federal response?","I was concerned at first about how much Congress and the taxpayers would be willing to appropriate and spend. I think $110 billion is a strong commitment, and I'm pleased with that. Any time we—I named a man named Don Powell to go down there, and the thing that's most important is for the Government to eliminate any bureaucratic obstacles when we find something that's not moving quick enough.I think, for example, about debris removal. There was the issue of whether or not the Government would pay for debris removal on private property, or not. So we worked out a plan with the local mayors and local county commissioners, local parish presidents to be able to designate certain property as a health hazard. And when they did so, then Government money could pay for it. In other words, we're trying to be flexible with the rules and regulations we have to deal with.But the place where people, I'm sure, are going to be most frustrated is whether or not they're going to get the money to rebuild their homes. And my attitude is, we've appropriated the money, and now we'll work with the States to get the money.April [April Ryan, American Urban Radio Networks], I suspect you have a followup on this.",Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – The interviewer wants a direct assessment: *Is there anything that has disappointed you about the recovery/Federal response?* The expected answer would be a clear statement (e.g., “Yes, I am disappointed because…”, or “No, I am not disappointed”).

2. **How the answer addresses it** – The interviewee does not give a straightforward yes/no or an explicit judgment of disappointment.  
   - They discuss concerns about congressional appropriations, bureaucratic obstacles, and debris‑removal rules.  
   - They also note positive points (“$110 billion is a strong commitment,” “I’m pleased with that”).  
   - The response never explicitly says “I am disappointed” or “I am not disappointed.” Instead, it offers related concerns and then shifts to procedural details and a closing remark.

3. **Information type** – The answer provides **partial, indirect information** about the speaker’s feelings (concerns about bureaucracy) but leaves the core question unanswered in a clear, explicit form. It is neither a full refusal nor a complete non‑answer; it is an incomplete, somewhat evasive response.

4. **Evasion/deflection** – The speaker deflects from the direct emotional judgment by focusing on logistical issues and positive aspects, which is characteristic of an **ambivalent** reply.

**Conclusion:** The response is not a clear reply (it does not explicitly answer the question) and it is not a total non‑reply (some relevant content is given). It is an incomplete, indirect answer that dodges the precise question.

**Classification:** **Ambivalent**

307,Why shouldn't Americans see the U.S. policy regarding North Korea as a failed one?,Q. Why shouldn't Americans see the U.S. policy regarding North Korea as a failed one?,Because it takes time to get things done.,Ambivalent,"**Step‑by‑step analysis**

1. **What the question asks** – It seeks a justification for why Americans should *not* view U.S. policy toward North Korea as a failure. The answer should explain the reasoning behind that stance (e.g., successes, constraints, ongoing efforts, etc.).

2. **What the answer provides** – The interviewee replies, “Because it takes time to get things done.”  
   - This statement offers a *reason* but does **not** elaborate on any concrete achievements, obstacles, or policy outcomes related to North Korea.  
   - It is a very general, almost tautological justification that sidesteps the substantive issue.

3. **Evaluation against the categories**  
   - **Clear Reply?** No. The response does not explicitly state the specific reasons, evidence, or policy outcomes that would support the claim. It merely offers a vague, generic justification.  
   - **Clear Non‑Reply?** No. The interviewee does give an answer; they are not refusing to answer, pleading ignorance, or asking for clarification.  
   - **Ambivalent?** Yes. The answer is **incomplete and partial**—it touches on the topic but does so in a **dodging/deflection** manner, providing only a superficial, implicit rationale rather than a thorough or explicit explanation.

**Conclusion:** The response falls into the *Ambivalent* category because it offers a vague, incomplete answer that deflects rather than directly addressing the question.
